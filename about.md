# About

VetSRev is a public database of citations for systematic reviews of relevance to veterinary medicine and science. It is produced by the [Centre for Evidence-based Veterinary Medicine](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/cevm/index.aspx) (CEVM) at the University of Nottingham.

The systematic reviews in VetSRev are found by searches of the PubMed and CAB Abstracts databases using specialised search filters, as well as alerts and contact with authors. If you think we have missed a relevant systematic review, or have any other query, please email us at [cevm@nottingham.ac.uk](mailto:cevm@nottingham.ac.uk).

To find out more about VetSRev and our inclusion and exclusion criteria, please see our document [About VetSRev](/About-VetSRev.pdf). The minimum criterion for inclusion as a systematic review in the database is that there should be details of the methods in the main paper, including the names of the bibliographic database(s) searched. It is important to appraise the systematic reviews before applying to your practice â€“ we recommend the [AMSTAR 2](https://amstar.ca/Amstar-2.php) tool, which is very quick and easy to use.

<!--If you are new to VetSRev, take a look at our [Introductory guide to using the database](#).-->

_We would like to acknowledge the kind co-operation of the U.S. National Library of Medicine and CABI  for allowing us to use citations and indexing terms derived from PubMed and CAB Abstracts._

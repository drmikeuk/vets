  abstract	= {Background  Bleeding is a feared adverse event during anticoagulant treatment. In patients on vitamin K antagonists, most bleedings occur with the international normalized ratio (INR) in the therapeutic range. Currently, identification of high-risk patients via laboratory methods is not reliable. In this systematic review, we assessed the ability of calibrated automated thrombin generation (CAT-TG) to predict bleeding in patients on anticoagulant treatment. Methods  A systematic search was executed in three databases: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane. Results  Seven studies were included; two were of good methodological quality. One study showed that patients on warfarin with INRs in range (2-3) admitted for hemorrhage ( n  = 28), had lower CAT-TG levels (endogenous thrombin potential [ETP]: 333 ± 89 nM/min) than patients on warfarin admitted for other reasons (ETP: 436 ± 207 nM/min; p  {\textless} 0.001). Another study found no difference in ETP or peak levels between bleeding and nonbleeding patients in PPP or PRP. When measured in whole blood, both levels were significantly lower in patients with bleeding compared with nonbleeding patients (median [interquartile range, IQR] ETP: 182.5 [157.2-2,847 nM/min] vs. median [IQR] ETP: 256.2 [194.9-344.2 nM/min]; p  {\textless} 0.001) and median [IQR] peak: 23.9 [19.6-41.8 nM] vs. median [IQR] peak: 39.1 [24.9-53.2 nM]; p  {\textless} 0.05). From the remaining studies, four suggested that CAT-TG is more sensitive in detecting hemostatic abnormalities than INR and one article found ETP and INR to be equally useful. However, insufficient data were provided to validate these conclusions. Conclusion  Studies investigating the direct association between decreased CAT-TG values and hemorrhagic events are rare. Therefore, the clinical consequences of low CAT-TG values remain to be further investigated.},

Here, we conducted a preclinical systematic review of 15 studies including 577 animals to establish the efficacy and potential mechanisms of AS-IV for animal models of viral myocarditis (VM). Six databases were searched from inception to October 2018. Application of the Cochrane Collaboration's tool 10-item checklist and Rev-Man 5.3 software to analyze risk of bias of studies and data on outcome measures revealed study quality scores ranging from 2 to 5. Compared with the control group, AS-IV induced a marked decrease in mortality (P {\textless} 0.05), inflammation of myocardium and pathological score (P{\textless} 0.05) and cardiac enzymes expression (P{\textless} 0.05), and improved the function of the heart (P{\textless} 0.05). The potential mechanisms of AS-IV action were determined as anti-remodeling of myocardium (n = 1), anti-virus (n = 2), antioxidant (n = 2), anti-inflammatory (n = 6), anti-apoptosis (n = 1) and alleviation of myocardial fibrosis (n = 2). The collective results indicate that AS-IV exerts cardioprotective effects in animals with VM via multiple signaling pathways.},

  abstract	= {The objective of this meta-analytical study was to investigate selected macrominerals, microminerals, and toxic heavy metals in the bovine whole-raw-milk (WRM) samples of published data. An analytical data set was constructed from 72 different studies from 37 countries with two types of production systems: a conventional production system (CPS) and an organic production system (OPS) compared with commercially available or retail-store-available milk (COM). Results of the meta-analytical study showed differences in the concentrations of macrominerals. Concentrations of Ca, Mg, K, and P were greater in the CPS samples, whereas Na was greater in the COM samples ( P {\textless} 0.05). Data also demonstrated that concentrations of microminerals like Cu, I, Fe, Mn, Se, and Zn in the organic WRM were lower ( P {\textless} 0.05) compared with the milk from CPS. The highest concentration of Ni was reported for COM ( P {\textless} 0.05); however, this value was below the minimum-risk level (MRL). Concentrations of heavy metals like As and Ni were greater in CPS milk than those in organic milk ( P {\textless} 0.05). In addition, there were greater concentrations of Cd and Pb in the WRM from CPS versus that from the organic farms. Concentration of Al was lowest in the OPS milk versus Al in the CPS which was 6.5-fold greater than in organic milk. The amount of Hg was below the MRL of 0.01 μmol/L for all production systems. A high variability was observed in the published data regarding the country of origin. Raw milk originating from Europe and North America was characterized by concentrations of macro- and microminerals below the MRLs as compared with that from specific countries, which had some minerals above the MRLs. For example, concentrations of Pb were above the MRL in the milk samples from Brazil, Croatia, Egypt, Mexico, Nigeria, Palestine, Romania, Serbia, and Turkey. Moreover, data from this study indicate that organic dairy farms are characterized by lower concentrations of toxic heavy metals in the WRM compared with those from CPS dairy farms.},

  abstract	= {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide and has complicated underlying pathophysiology. Numerous TBI animal models have been developed over the past decade to effectively mimic the human TBI pathophysiology. These models are of mostly mammalian origin including rodents and non-human primates. However, the mammalian models demanded higher costs and have lower throughput often limiting the progress in TBI research. Thus, this systematic review aims to discuss the potential benefits of non-mammalian TBI models in terms of their face validity in resembling human TBI. Three databases were searched as follows: PubMed, Scopus, and Embase, for original articles relating to non-mammalian TBI models, published between January 2010 and December 2019. A total of 29 articles were selected based on PRISMA model for critical appraisal. Zebrafish, both larvae and adult, was found to be the most utilized non-mammalian TBI model in the current literature, followed by the fruit fly and roundworm. In conclusion, non-mammalian TBI models have advantages over mammalian models especially for rapid, cost-effective, and reproducible screening of effective treatment strategies and provide an opportunity to expedite the advancement of TBI research.},

  abstract	= {China once suffered greatly from schistosomiasis japonica, a major zoonotic disease. Nearly 70 years of multidisciplinary efforts have achieved great progress in disease control, with infections in both humans and bovines significantly reduced to very low levels. However, reaching for the target of complete interruption of transmission at the country level by 2030 still faces great challenges, with areas of ongoing endemicity and/or re-emergence within previously 'eliminated' regions. The objectives of this study were, by using meta-analytical methods, to estimate the overall prevalence of Schistosoma japonicum infections in abundant commensal rodent species in mainland China after the introduction of praziquantel for schistosomiasis treatment in humans and bovines in 1980s. In doing so we thereby aimed to further assess the role of wild rodents as potential reservoirs in ongoing schistosome transmission. Published studies on infection prevalence of S. japonicum in wild rodents in mainland China since 1980 were searched across five electronic bibliographic databases and lists of article references. Eligible studies were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Risks of within and across study biases, and the variations in prevalence estimates attributable to heterogeneities were assessed. The pooled infection prevalence and its 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. We identified a total of 37 relevant articles involving 61 field studies which contained eligible data on 8,795 wild rodents across mainland China. The overall pooled infection prevalence was 3.86\% (95\% CI: 2.16-5.93\%). No significant change in the overall pooled prevalence was observed between 1980-2003 (n = 23 studies) and 2004-current (n = 38 studies). However, whilst the estimated prevalence decreased over time in the marshland and lake regions, there was an apparent increase in prevalence within hilly and mountainous regions. Among seven provinces, a significant prevalence reduction was only seen in Jiangsu where most endemic settings are classified as the marshland and lakes. These estimates changed over season, ranging from 0.58\% in spring to 22.39\% in winter, in association with increases in rodent density. This study systematically analyzed S. japonicum infections in wild rodents from the published literature over the last forty years after the introduction of praziquantel for schistosomiasis treatment in humans and bovines in 1980s. Although numbers of schistosomiasis cases in humans and bovines have been greatly reduced, no such comparable overall change of infection prevalence in rodents was detected. Furthermore, there appeared to be an increase in S. japonicum prevalence in rodents over time within hilly and mountainous regions. Rodents have been projected to become the dominant wildlife in human-driven environments and the main reservoir of zoonotic diseases in general within tropical zones. Our findings thus suggest that it is now necessary to include monitoring and evaluation of potential schistosome infection within rodents, particularly in hilly and mountainous regions, if we are ever to reach the new 2030 elimination goals and to maximize the impact of future public, and indeed One Health, interventions across, regional, national and international scales.},

  abstract	= {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ligusticum wallichii has been used to treat renal diseases for thousands of years in China. Ligustrazine (Lig) is the active ingredient of Ligusticum wallichii that possesses a variety of biological activities against kidney disease. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this review is to further evaluate whether the supplementation with Lig has an effect on improving renal pathology, renal function indexes and blood glucose levels in animal model of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Potential mechanisms of Lig for DN as well as the existing problems regarding the modeling method and limitations in this area of research were also summarized. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist was used to organize the search of eight databases from inception to June 2019. We used Cochrane Collaboration's 10-item checklist and Rev-Man 5.3 software to analyze the data as well as risk of bias. RESULTS: The study quality scores ranged from 2 to 6 points with an average of 4.471. Compared with the control group, Lig significantly improved pathological changes of kidney including glomeruli and tubules, and induced significant decreases in levels of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, 24-h urinary albumin and HbA1c, as well as increasing creatinine clearance rates. In subgroup analysis, the groups of high-dose STZ (≥60 mg/kg) and longer period of Lig treatment ({\textgreater}8 w) showed better results than those of the control group. No difference was seen between the high ({\textgreater}150 mg/kg, QD) and low (≤150 mg/kg, QD) dose of Lig treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Lig exerts renoprotective functions in an animal model of DN mediated by antioxidant action, inhibition of apoptosis, anti-inflammatory action, reduction of renal fibrosis, reduction of the proliferation of mesangial cells, inhibition of endotheliosis, inhibition of atherosclerosis and promotion of renal autophagy. The positive conclusion should be treated cautiously because of various methodological flaws. Further studies are recommended according to ARRIVE guidelines. The method of modeling with high-dose STZ should be avoided and improved STZ modeling schemes are recommended. Considering the large dosage range of Lig used clinically and in animals, the future studies on the basis of animal renal histology are urgently needed to determine the optimal dosages to delay histological changes. Nevertheless, together, our findings suggest that Lig is a renoprotective candidate drug for treatment of DN.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: There is an increasing of reports describing the efficacy of neuroprotective small molecule in Parkinson's disease (PD) models. Ideally, the choice of pushing drug candidates to clinical trial should be based on an unbiased assessment of all available data. Systematic review uses a methodical approach to minimize the bias in the selection of studies for inclusion, providing a comprehensive understanding of the drug's effects on multiple animal models with different mechanism. To our knowledge, such assessments of baicalein, which is a candidate neuroprotective drug with efficacy in PD, have not been fully conducted. PURPOSE: To provide a comprehensive understanding of baicalein's effects on different animal models with different mechanism by using a methodical approach to minimize the bias in the selection of studies. METHODS: In this study, we used a systematic review method to comprehensively assess the efficacy of baicalein in animal PD models. By using electronic and manual search for the literatures, we identified studies describing the efficacy of baicalein in animal models of PD. RESULTS: We identified 16 studies describing the efficacy of baicalein in animal models of PD. The methodological quality of all preclinical trials is ranged from 2 to 5. 16 studies involved 4 main kinds of PD animal models. They are MPP+-induced, rotenone-induced, 6-OHDA-induced and acrolein-induced PD models, respectively. The protective effects of baicalein were studied mainly focusing on the anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory action. Beyond that, there are 2 articles describing the effects of baicalein on neurotransmitter balance in the basal ganglia, and 2 articles reporting the effects in decreasing synuclein aggregation. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of baicalein in PD experimental animals and analyzed the pharmacological mechanism. The information will be useful for the further development of baicalein into anti-PD agent and provide unbiased evidence for the conduct of clinical trials. In addition, such evaluation based on animal experiments can give us a general introduction to different animal models of PD, either guiding the further model tests, or avoiding the unnecessary replication.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: With increasing use of pharmaceuticals, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) has become a significant therapeutic challenge to physicians all over the world. Drugs based on Schisandra fruits (SF for short, the fruits of Schisandra chinensis or Schisandra sphenanthera) or synthetic analogues of schisandrin C, are commonly prescribed for treating DILI in China. PURPOSE: This review summarizes the literature regarding the application of SF-derived drugs in patients with DILI and current understanding of mechanisms underlying the protective effects of SF against liver injury. METHODS: Keywords related to drug-induced liver injury and Schisandra fruits were searched in the following databases: Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, LiverTox, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Scientific Journal database (VIP), and Wanfang database. All studies, published in English or Chinese, were included. Clinical study exclusion criteria: if patients received other Chinese herbal medicines in a study, the study will not be included in this review. RESULTS: Clinical studies have shown that SF-derived drugs are effective in inhibiting drug-induced elevation of serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase and total bilirubin. Cellular and animal studies have demonstrated that crude SF extracts, lignan compounds found in SF, and SF-derived drugs are effective in protecting the liver against xenobiotic-induced injury. Regulation of cytochrome P450 enzyme activity, anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation and acceleration of liver regeneration are involved in the hepatoprotective mechanisms of SF. CONCLUSION: SF-derived drugs are effective in ameliorating DILI in China. To verify the clinical efficacy of these drugs, high-quality clinical studies are needed.},

Previous research has suggested its potentially beneficial effects on diabetic nephropathies. However, its effects and protective mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a preclinical systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and potential mechanisms of ASIV in reducing kidney damage in diabetes mellitus (DM) models. Studies were searched from nine databases until January 2020. A random-effects model was used to calculate combined standardised mean difference estimates and 95 \% confidence intervals. Risk of bias of studies was assessed using the Systematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experimentation risk of bias tool 10-item checklist. RevMan 5.3 software was used for statistical analysis. Twenty-three studies involving 562 animals were included in the meta-analysis. Studies quality scores ranged from 2 to 5. The ASIV group induced a marked decrease in serum creatinine (P {\textless} 0.00001), blood urea nitrogen (P {\textless} 0.00001), 24-h urine protein (P {\textless} 0.00001) and pathological score (P {\textless} 0.001) compared with the control group.

  abstract	= {Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that has few treatment options. Riluzole, a sodium channel blocker used to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, has been initially trialed in human SCI. We performed a systematic review to critically assess the efficacy of riluzole in locomotor recovery and damage extension in SCI rat models, and the potential for clinical translation. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Chinese databases were searched from their inception date to March 2018. Two reviewers independently selected animal studies that evaluated neurological recovery and lesion area following riluzole treatment in SCI rat models, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Pairwise meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, and network meta-analysis were performed to assess the effects of riluzole on SCI. Ten eligible studies were included. Two studies had high methodological quality. Overall, the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores were increased in riluzole-treated animals versus controls, and effect sizes showed a gradual increase from the 1st (five studies, n = 104, mean difference = 1.24, 95\% CI = 0.11 to 2.37, p = 0.03) to 6th week after treatment (five studies, n = 120, mean difference = 2.34, 95\% CI = 1.26 to 3.42, p {\textless} 0.0001). Riluzole was associated with improved outcomes in the inclined plane test and the tissue preservation area. Subgroup analyses suggested an association of locomotor recovery with riluzole dose. Network meta-analysis showed that 5 mg/kg riluzole exhibited greater protection than 2.5 and 8 mg/kg riluzole. Collectively, this review suggests that riluzole has a protective effect on SCI, with good safety and a clear mechanism of action and may be suitable for future clinical trials or applications. However, animal results should be interpreted with caution given the known limitations in animal experimental design and methodological quality.},

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review in both English and Chinese search engines. We estimated the pooled odds ratios of biosecurity indicators relating to AI infections at market level using a quality effects (QE) meta-analysis model. RESULTS: Biosecurity measures effective at reducing AI market contamination and poultry infection at LBMs include smaller market size, selling single poultry species and separating different species, performing cleaning and disinfection and market closures, ban on overnight storage, and sourcing poultry from local areas. Our meta-analysis indicates that higher risk of exposure to AI infection occurs in workers at retail LBMs, female workers, and those who contact ducks, conduct cleaning, slaughtering, defeathering, or evisceration. CONCLUSIONS: The most effective strategies to reduce AI market contamination identified in this study should target larger LBMs that are located at noncentral city areas and sell and slaughter multispecies of live poultry. Live bird market workers directly involved in cleaning and poultry processing tasks should participate in occupational health and safety programs.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Lupus nephritis is usually manifested by proteinuria, active urinary sediment, hypertension, and renal failure and is a serious complication with more than 50\% occurrence in systemic lupus erythematosus patients. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) present remarkable immunomodulatory ability, and these cells are potential therapeutic agents for autoimmune disorders. In clinical trials, the effectiveness of MSC in the treatment of lupus nephritis is still controversial. A meta-analysis was performed to assess whether MSC can achieve good efficacy in the treatment of lupus nephritis in mice. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed in Cochrane Library, ISI Web of Science, PubMed, and EMBASE from inception to Oct 1, 2019. Two authors independently extracted the data, which were pooled and calculated using RevMan 5.3. RESULTS: A total of 28 studies met the inclusion criteria. MSC treatment resulted in lower levels of ds-DNA (OR = - 29.58, 95\% CI - 29.58, - 17.99; P {\textless} 0.00001), ANA (OR = - 70.93, 95\% CI - 104.55, - 37.32; P {\textless} 0.0001), Scr (OR = - 8.20, 95\% CI - 12.71, - 3.69; P = 0.0004), BUN (OR = - 14.57, 95\% CI - 20.50, - 8.64; P {\textless} 0.00001), proteinuria (OR = - 4.26, 95\% CI - 5.15 to - 3.37; P {\textless} 0.00001), and renal sclerosis score (OR = - 1.92, 95\% CI - 2.66 to - 1.18; P {\textless} 0.00001), and MSC treatment could get higher levels of albumin. To detect the potential, the cytokines were also assessed, and the MSC treatment group had lower levels of IL-2, IL-12, IL-17, and IFN-γ when compared with the control group. However, the difference was not notable for IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TGF-β, MCP-1, TNF-α, Th1, Th17, Foxp3, or Tregs. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that MSC treatment in an animal model for lupus nephritis in the studies included in the meta-analysis resulted in lower levels of ds-DNA, ANA, Scr, BUN, proteinuria, and renal sclerosis score, and MSC treatment could get higher levels of albumin.},

  abstract	= {Background: Brucellosis is one of the most significant zoonosis over the world, threatening both veterinary and human public health. However, few studies were focused on nationwide animal brucellosis and made association with human brucellosis. Methodology and Principal Findings: We conducted a bilingual literature search on Brucella or brucellosis in China on the two largest databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure and PubMed) and conducted a systematic review. A total of 1,383 Chinese and 81 English publications, published between 1958 and 2018 were identified. From them, 357 publications presenting 692 datasets were subjected to the meta-analysis. The overall prevalence rate is 1.70\% (95\% CI: 1.66-1.74), with a declining (until the late 1990s) and rising trend (starting the early 2000s). Interestingly, the animal with highest prevalence rate is canine (8.35\%, 95\% CI: 7.21-9.50), and lowest in cattle (1.22\%, 95\% CI: 1.17-1.28). The prevalence of Brucella in animals was unequally distributed among the 24 examined regions in China. Conclusions: Brucellosis is a reemerging disease for both humans and animals in China. The observed data suggests that dogs and yaks are the leading reservoirs for Brucella, and the provinces with highest prevalence rates in animals are Hubei, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, Fujian, and Guizhou. Accordingly targeted intervention policy should be implemented to break the Brucella transmission chain between animals and humans in China.},

A total of 19 studies were included for analysis in our study. Results indicated that the sperm count of rats exposed to fenvalerate was lower than that of rats in control groups. The sperm count, sperm motility, and testosterone level of rats exposed to cypermethrin and deltamethrin were lower than those of rats in control groups. Moreover, the sperm morphology of rats exposed to these pyrethroid pesticides was abnormal compared with that of rats in control groups. The present meta-analysis indicates that pyrethroid pesticides decrease rat sperm count, sperm motility, and testosterone level and cause abnormal rat sperm morphology. Therefore, pyrethroid pesticides can damage the testis of male rats.},

  abstract	= {Sepsis may directly lead to multiple organ failure, which is among the leading causes of mortality in critically ill patients. According to data released by the Global Sepsis Alliance, the number of mortalities due to sepsis exceeded the combined number for prostate cancer, breast cancer and AIDS in 2012. To date, studies have reported that resveratrol has marked positive effects including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and pro-microcirculatory functions in sepsis-induced organ injury, significantly improving the survival time and mortality of sepsis animals. The present systematic review sought to further clarify the efficacy and safety of resveratrol in the treatment of sepsis. Studies on resveratrol application in the treatment of sepsis-induced organ injury in animal models were reviewed by searching various Chinese and other language databases (PubMed, Embase, CNKI, WanFang and WeiPu) and by manually searching the references of related articles. The selection and evaluation of the studies was performed by two independent reviewers. A total of 260 related studies were initially identified. Following application of the exclusion factors and inclusion criteria, 11 studies were included. Meta-analysis revealed that resveratrol exerted significant protective effect in sepsis-induced animal models of organ injury, through anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and pro-microcirculatory functions compared with in the placebo group. While nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF-2) are the two major signaling pathways to have been associated with the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects of resveratrol, these factors were not quantified for mean values, therefore not suitable for systematic evaluation. For related factors, the results of meta-analysis were as follows: For tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), the standardized mean difference (SMD) was -13.50 [95\% confidence interval (CI): -22.08, -4.91; P=0.002]; for malondialdehyde (MDA), the SMD was -3.10 (95\% CI: -5.27, -0.93; P=0.005); for mean arterial pressure the SMD was 1.34 (95\% CI: 0.07, 2.62; P=0.04); for interleukin (IL)-6 the SMD was -9.57 (95\% CI: -20.90, 1.75; P=0.10); and for IL-10 the SMD was 0.80 (95\% CI: -0.73, 2.34; P=0.31). It was concluded that resveratrol exerted significant anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects through NF-κB and NRF-2 signaling pathways in animal models of sepsis-induced multiple organ injury, manifesting as significant downregulation of TNF-α and MDA expression and improved microcirculation, therefore ameliorating septic damage to the body, which may ultimately improve survival ratios.},

  abstract	= {OBJECTIVES: The decision to apply simple water-seal drainage or the addition of an external suction to the simple water-seal drainage following pulmonary surgery is made based on the surgeon's experience or preference and has remained controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effects of the addition of suction to simple water-seal on the postoperative outcomes. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched from their inception to 30 August 2017. The risk ratio and the weight mean difference were calculated for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively, each with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). The heterogeneity and risk of bias were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 10 randomized controlled trials enrolling 1601 patients were included. Overall, compared with simple water-seal, the addition of external suction reduced the occurrence of postoperative pneumothorax (risk ratio 0.35, 95\% CI 0.13-0.93; P = 0.04) and other cardiopulmonary complications (risk ratio 0.65, 95\% CI 0.48-0.89; P = 0.008), and increased the duration of chest tube drainage (weight mean difference 0.92 days, 95\% CI 0.04-1.81, P = 0.04). However, the effect difference between the 2 groups was not significant regarding air leak duration, length of hospital stay and the occurrence of prolonged air leak. The stability of these studies was strong. No evidence of publication bias was detected. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of suction to simple water-seal made no difference to air leak duration, hospital stay or the occurrence of prolonged air leak following pulmonary surgery. In patients where there is concern about a residual or increasing pneumothorax, the addition of suction may be applied selectively.},

  abstract	= {Interleukin (IL)-33 is a member of the IL-1 family of proteins that have multiple roles in organ-specific inflammation. Many studies suggest diagnostic and therapeutic implications of this cytokine. Many studies have reported pro-inflammatory roles for IL-33 in innate immune responses involving the heart and lung. Recent studies also describe pro-inflammatory and regulatory roles for IL-33 in the pathogenesis of brain and liver disorders in addition to regulatory roles for this cytokine in the heart and lung. In this focused systematic review, we will review the literature regarding pro-inflammatory and regulatory effects of IL-33 in the brain and liver. We will also assess the potential risk of bias in the published literature in order to uncover gaps in the knowledge that will be useful for the scientific community. We utilized guidelines set by preferred reporting items for systemic reviews and meta-analyses. The electronic database was PubMed. Eligibility criteria included organ-specific inflammation in mice and humans, organ-specific inflammation in the central nervous and hepatic systems, and IL-33. Outcomes were pro-inflammatory or regulatory effects of IL-33. Risk of bias in individual studies and across studies was addressed by adapting the Cochrane Rob 2.0 tool. We discovered that a source of bias across the studies was a lack of randomization in human studies. Additionally, because the majority of studies were performed in mice, this could be perceived as a potential risk of bias. Regarding the central nervous system, roles for IL-33 in the development and maturation of neuronal circuits were reported; however, exact mechanisms by which this occurred were not elucidated. IL-33 was produced by astrocytes and endothelial cells while IL-33 receptors were expressed by microglia and astrocytes, demonstrating that these cells are first responders for IL-33; however, in the CNS, IL-33 seems to induce Th1 cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α chemokines such as RANTES, MCP-1, MIP-1α, and IP-10, as well as nitric oxide. In the liver, similar risks of bias were determined because of the lack of randomized controlled trials in humans and because the majority of studies were performed in mice. Interestingly, the strain of mouse utilized in the study seemed to affect the role of IL-33 in liver inflammation. Lastly, similar to the brain, IL-33 appeared to have ST2-independent regulatory functions in the liver. Our results reveal plausible gaps in what is known regarding IL-33 in the pathogenesis of brain and liver disorders. We highlight key studies in the lung and heart as examples of advancements that likely occurred because of countless basic and translational studies in this area. More research is needed in these areas in order to assess the diagnostic or therapeutic potential of IL-33 in these disorders.},

Methods Relevant publications were identified by systematic searches of PubMed, ISI Web of Science and Elsevier-Scopus databases. Results A total of Eleven studies with moderate quality were selected for analysis. A meta-analysis of survival rates revealed a significant advantage of RAGE inhibition in comparison with controls (HR 0.67, 95\% CI 0.52-0.86). This effect was most pronounced in polymicrobial infection (HR 0.28, 95\% CI 0.14-0.55), followed by Gram positive (G(+)) bacterial infection (HR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.50-0.97) and Gram negative (G(-)) bacterial infection (HR 0.89, 95\% CI 0.58-1.38). For G(+) bacterial infection, RAGE inhibition decreased bacterial outgrowth and dissemination, inflammatory cell influx, plasma cytokine levels, and pulmonary injury. Conclusions RAGE inhibition appears to have a beneficial impact on the outcome of sepsis in animal models, although there are discrepancies between different types of infection.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Inconsistent results of the association between fish consumption and stroke risk have been indicated in previous epidemiological studies. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to estimate the impact of fish consumption on stroke risk. METHODS: The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched through a computer search. Prospective cohort studies satisfying predetermined inclusion criterion were included. Random-effect model was adopted in this meta-analysis. Analysis of subgroup, sensitivity, publication bias, dose-response, power, and quality of evidence was also conducted. RESULTS: Thirty one publications including 33 independent prospective cohort studies were identified in this meta-analysis. In the primary analysis of the highest versus lowest categories of fish consumption, pooled results indicated that a significant trend toward an inverse association between fish intake and stroke risk (HR = .90, 95\% confidence interval [CI] .85-.96). Further subgroup analyses indicated an inverse association was more pronounced in the group of hemorrhagic stroke (HR=.88, 95\% CI .80-.96), female (HR =.83, 95\% CI .75-.92), and Asia-Pacific (HR = .87, 95\% CI .80-.95). Both the funnel plot and Egger tests suggested no evidence of publication bias. Dose-response analysis showed a linear relationship between fish intake and stroke and the risk of stroke decreased by 2\%-12\% with increasing intake of fish up to 100-700 g/week. According to the NutriGrade scoring system, the level of metaevidence quality was moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Based on current evidence from prospective cohort studies, we concluded that fish consumption was associated with a decreased risk of stroke.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used subject and free words to search PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. The risk-of-bias evaluation tool was used to assess literature quality. Data merging and statistical analyses were carried out using Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 13.0. All indicators were expressed as the mean difference (MD) and 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI). The heterogeneity test was conducted according to I(2) and Q tests. We used Egger's test to evaluate publication bias quantitatively. RESULTS: This was a meta-analysis of intervention trials. Thirty-two studies (1562 patients) were included. The quality of the included studies was acceptable. Compared with consumption of animal protein, plant protein reduced total cholesterol (TC) (MD = - 0.19 mmol/L, 95\% CI - 0.26, - 0.12), triglyceride (MD = - 0.07 mmol/L, 95\% CI - 0.13, - 0.02), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (MD = - 0.19 mmol/L, 95\% CI - 0.26, - 0.13), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD = - 0.05 mmol/L, 95\% CI - 0.09, - 0.01), TC/LDL-C ratio (MD = - 0.17, 95\% CI - 0.32, - 0.02) and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio (MD = - 0.20, 95\% CI - 0.33, - 0.06) significantly and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (MD = 0.03 mmol/L, 95\% CI 0.01, 0.06) levels, but had no effect on BW (MD = - 0.41 kg, 95\% CI - 2.14, 1.33) or BMI (MD = 0.11 kg/m(2), 95\% CI - 0.51, 0.73).

Even though commercial antimicrobial interventions in meat industries are overall efficient to eliminate bacterial contamination, the capability of antibiotic resistant bacteria of resisting to antimicrobial interventions, compared to the susceptible bacterial population, was not fully understood. The aim of this study was to compare the impacts of various antimicrobial interventions used for beef processing on antibiotic resistant and susceptible strains of Salmonella and Escherichia coli. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify, evaluate and summarize primary research that provide quantitative information about the efficacy of various antimicrobial interventions in reducing antibiotic resistant and susceptible bacterial contamination of raw beef products. Eleven citations (of 409) were determined to be relevant to address the question (nine citations for Salmonella and two for Escherichia coli) and eligible for data extraction and subsequent meta-analysis. Through the comprehensive search, data for five categories of antimicrobial interventions, including acid, oxidizer, physical, thermal treatments, and others, were summarized. Ratio of the efficacy of eliminating antibiotic resistant to susceptible contamination by a specific intervention was calculated, showing most of efficacy ratios were around 1.0. The results indicate that the efficacy of antimicrobial interventions commonly used during beef processing in reducing bacteria is not affected by their antibiotic resistant profiles.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Vascular dementia is the second most common type of dementia that causes cognitive dysfunction. Acupuncture, an ancient therapy, has been mentioned for the treatment of vascular dementia in previous studies. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of acupuncture in animal models of vascular dementia. METHODS: Experimental animal studies of treating vascular dementia with acupuncture were gathered from Embase, PubMed and Ovid Medline (R) from the dates of the databases' creation to December 2016. We adopted the CAMARADES 10-item checklist to evaluate the quality of the included studies. The Morris water maze test was considered as an outcome measure. The software Stata12.0 was used for the meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was examined using I(2) statistics, and we conducted subgroup analyses to determine the causes of heterogeneity for escape latency and duration in original platform. RESULTS: Sixteen studies involving 363 animals met the inclusion criteria. The included studies scored between 4 and 8 points, and the mean was 5.44. The results of the meta-analysis indicated remarkable differences with acupuncture on increasing the duration in the former platform quadrant both in EO models (SMD = 1.56, 95\% CI: 1.02 {\textasciitilde} 2.11; p {\textless} 0.00001) and 2-VO models (SMD 4.29, 95\% CI 3.23 {\textasciitilde} 5.35; p {\textless} 0.00001) compared with the control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture may be effective in improving cognitive function in vascular dementia animal models. The mechanisms of acupuncture for vascular dementia are multiple such as anti-apoptosis, antioxidative stress reaction, and metabolism enhancing of glucose and oxygen.},

Various nanoscale delivery systems have been developed for improving its bioavailability. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of nanoscale delivery systems on improving lutein bioavailability in rodent models. Using EBSCOhost and PubMed, a total of eleven peer-reviewed articles published from 2000 to 2020 were identified. Plasma lutein concentration, pharmacokinetic parameters, including maximum concentration (C(max)), area under curve (AUC), and time to reach the maximum concentration (T(max)), and lutein accumulation in organs were extracted to evaluate the bioavailability of lutein using nanoscale delivery methods as compared with unencapsulated or raw lutein. Various nanoscale delivery systems, including polymer nanoparticles, emulsions, and lutein nanoparticles, significantly improved the bioavailability of lutein, as evidenced by increased plasma lutein concentrations, C(max), or AUC. Additionally, five out of seven studies observed enhanced accumulation of lutein in the liver and the eyes. Polymer nanoparticles and emulsions improve the dispersibility and stability of lutein, thus lutein might be more accessible in the small intestine. Lutein nanoparticles shortened the T(max). Further studies are warranted to evaluate the effectiveness of nanoscale delivery systems on improving the functionalities of lutein.},

Thus, further analysis is required on the efficacy and safety of tralokinumab as an asthma biologic. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous injection of tralokinumab in patients with moderate to severe asthma. METHODS: Clinical trials were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov from their inception to November 4, 2018. Only randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with tralokinumab versus placebo treatment in patients with moderate to severe asthma were evaluated. Efficacy and safety outcomes were extracted, and a meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. The Cochrane Collaboration's risk-of-bias assessment tool was used to assess the risk of bias. RESULTS: Five studies describing 6 RCTs (including 2928 adults with moderate to severe asthma) were pooled and analyzed in this study. Absolute FEV(1) was statistically improved in patients receiving tralokinumab at 300 mg every 2 weeks (mean difference [MD], 0.14 L; 95\% CI, 0.08-0.21) and 600 mg every 2 weeks (MD, 0.20 L; 95\% CI, 0.01-0.39), as well as FEV(1)\% changes (MD, 5.82\%, 95\% CI, 3.58-8.06, and MD, 11.8\%, 95\% CI, 0.79-22.81, respectively). Also, absolute forced vital capacity volume changes (MD, 0.11 L; 95\% CI, 0.01-0.21) and percentage changes (MD, 4.44\%; 95\% CI, 0.84-8.04) improved in tralokinumab at 300 mg every 2 weeks. Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire scores were not significantly different, and absolute Asthma Control Questionnaire 6 scores were statistically improved but did not reach the clinically meaningful difference. Tralokinumab treatment did not decrease annualized asthma exacerbation rate in unselected patients with moderate to severe asthma, but it was associated with improved annualized asthma exacerbation rate in patients with severe asthma with high fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels (rate ratio, 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.53-0.97). Tralokinumab was not associated with an increased incidence of serious adverse events, but it did show an increase in mild injection-site reactions (odds ratio, 5.92; 95\% CI, 1.61-21.76). CONCLUSION: This pooled analysis of 6 RCTs suggested that tralokinumab was well tolerated and it modestly improved FEV(1) and forced vital capacity in patients with moderate to severe asthma. It did not render clinically important improvements in asthma-related quality of life, and nor did it reduce asthma exacerbations.},

Moreover, we excluded repeated studies, reviews, other host studies, as well as studies with inconsistent data, incomplete information, those that only provided prevalence data, and those outside of Mainland China. We extracted the numbers of pigs with Toxoplasma infection from the obtained studies, and calculated the pooled prevalence of Toxoplasma infection in the pigs using a random-effects model. The data of 44 articles (including data on 46,723 pigs) were compliant with the standards. The pooled prevalence of T. gondii infection in pigs in China was 29\% (95\% CI 24-34), with 25\% (95\% CI 18-32) in pigs sampled before 2010 and 28\% (95\% CI 21-36) in pigs sampled in 2010 or later. The pooled prevalence of T. gondii in pigs from Northeast China (20\%, 95\% CI 14-26) was significantly lower than those from other regions (North China: 40\%, 95\% CI 32-47; Northwest China: 32\%, 95\% CI 13-51; East China: 30\%, 95\% CI 20-41; and South China: 35\%, 95\% CI 26-45; Central China: 23\%, 95\% CI 14-31; Southwest China: 33\%, 95\% CI 15-52). The estimated pooled prevalence of T. gondii infection was 36\% (95\% CI 25-47, 8,018/21,892) in pigs tested by ELISA, 24\% (95\% CI 19-28, 4,304/18,608) in pigs examined by IHA, and 19\% (95\% CI 8-31, 1,041/6,223) in pigs detected by other methods. Moreover, 1202 of 7470 piglets were detected as T. gondii-positive, and the prevalence (17\%) was lower than that in fattening pigs (25\%, OR = 1.28), sows (34\%, OR = 2.13), and breeding boars (35\%, OR = 2.46). Our findings suggested that toxoplasmosis is common in pigs in Mainland China. It is necessary to monitor the prevalence of T. gondii in pigs, and powerful and effective regulatory measures should be undertaken to reduce human exposure to T. gondii via the consumption of pork.},

  abstract	= {Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a group of environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). According to recent studies, the associations between PBDEs and rodent male reproductive system are controversial. Therefore, we performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the effects of PBDEs on rodent male reproductive system. Data were extracted from articles collected from PubMed, Web of Science, and other databases. The pooled standard mean deviation (SMD) with 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) was used to evaluate the association between the male rodent reproductive system impairment and PBDE exposure. Ten articles were included in the present meta-analysis and systematic review. The summary SMD of reproductive toxicity associated with PBDEs was -0.46 (95\% CI: -0.69, -0.22), and the overall association between DE-71 along with BDE-209 and male reproductive system damage was statistically significant (SMD = -0.7 95\% CI: -1.18, -0.21, p = .041; SMD = -0.41, 95\% CI: -0.77, -0.05, p = .000). The adverse impact of PBDEs on rodent male reproductive system, especially seminal vesicle (SMD = -1.09, 95\% CI: -1.49, -0.49, p = .523) and ventral prostate (SMD = -1.27, 95\% CI: -1.88, -0.65, p = .821), were clearly demonstrated. Moderate (SMD = -0.81, 95\% CI: -1.182, -0.437, p = .197) and high (SMD = -0.41, 95\% CI: -0.76, -0.05, p = .000) dosage may have exerted effect than relatively low (SMD = -0.29, 95\% CI: -0.17, 0.12, p = .136) dosage. In conclusion, our meta-analysis and systematic review suggested PBDE toxicity on the male reproductive system.},

METHODS: Two reviewers independently searched electronic databases including PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library up to February 2017. Strict literature retrieval and data extraction were performed to extract relevant data. Data analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.3 software and Stata version 12.0. And relative risks (RRs) for survival rate were calculated. A fixed-effect model was selected to pool and a forest plot was used to display RRs. RESULTS: Four studies involving 394 animals were finally included. Nine control groups are used to pool. A fixed-effect model was applied to estimate a pooled RR of 2.19 (95\% CI: 1.74-2.76), indicating that PD-1 related blockade increased survival rate in sepsis animals. CONCLUSION: We concluded that PD-1 related blockade can improve survival of animals with sepsis. But robust standardized clinical experiments for sepsis patients are highly desirable.},

  abstract	= {Brucellosis is one of the most common zoonoses worldwide, causing huge economic losses in the animal industry and posing a serious threat to human health. Although the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) has recommended strategies or measures to control or eradicate brucellosis, only some developed countries have achieved freedom from animal brucellosis. In developing countries, brucellosis remains a serious problem, and the importance of its control has attracted little attention. The strategies and measures are difficult to implement effectively in countries with limited resources because the eradication of brucellosis is an expensive, time-consuming and labor-intensive project. Therefore, more effort is needed to explore the appropriate strategies and measures in developing countries. In this study, we collected the available publications regarding brucellosis control or eradication programs in different countries and areas, and summarized the main strategies and measures, supplementary measures, effects, and lessons learned during their implementation. Results showed that the freedom from animal brucellosis was only achieved in three countries among the 23 included countries and areas after the implementation of the programs, which had lasted several decades. Either alone or together, vaccination and test-and-slaughter programs can effectively reduce brucellosis prevalence. Supplementary measures involve a number of aspects, and their effective implementation is crucial to the success of disease control and cannot be ignored. While disease control or eradication requires extensive resources, some studies have shown that a well-designed and well-implemented disease control or eradication program is economically effective. Experience has revealed that even if significant results have been achieved, the project could not be terminated without careful consideration due to the potential for recurrence.},

Infections from human and animal reservoir hosts occur due to the consumption of raw or undercooked fish with C. sinensis metacercariae. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of C. sinensis metacercariae in fish in South-East Asia via systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang and Chongqing VIP databases for studies published between 1976 and 2020 that are related to the prevalence of C. sinensis metacercariae in fish. Studies were screened with keywords based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Seventy-one eligible articles were identified, covering three countries: China, Korea and Vietnam. The pooled prevalence of C. sinensis metacercariae in fish from South-East Asia was 30.5\%, with 35.1\% in China, 29.7\% in Korea and 8.4\% in Vietnam. In subgroup analyses of climate, season, water source and publication date, the highest prevalence was identified in the Dwb climate type (43.3\%), summer (70.2\%), river (34.5\%) and pre-2001 publications (38.9\%), respectively. In comparison, the lowest prevalence was found in the Dfa climate type (14.5\%), winter (19.5\%), lake (8.0\%) and post-2001 publications (23.8\%). Meta-regression results indicated that country (p = .009), the published time (p = .035) and water source subgroups (p = .003) may be the source of heterogeneity. Overall, our study indicates that a high prevalence of C. sinensis infections occurs in fish in China, Korea and Vietnam, illuminating a significant public health concern in these countries.},

Methods: A comprehensive literature search in the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase (up to September 2020), was conducted to identify the prospective cohort studies concerning the associations of fish and omega-3 fatty acids consumption with the risk of VTE. The pooled relative risk (RR) of VTE for the highest vs. lowest category of fish and omega-3 fatty acids consumption, as well as their corresponding 95\% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Results: A total of seven articles with eight prospective cohort studies were included. Specifically, six studies were related to fish consumption, and the overall multi-variable adjusted RR showed no significant relationship between fish consumption and the risk of VTE (RR = 1.02, 95\% CI: 0.93-1.11; P = 0.709). In the four studies related to omega-3 fatty acids consumption, the overall multi-variable adjusted RR suggested that omega-3 fatty acids consumption was associated with a lower risk of VTE (RR = 0.89, 95\% CI: 0.80-0.98; P = 0.024). Moreover, two studies were related to recurrent VTE, and the overall multi-variable adjusted RR demonstrated a significant inverse association between omega-3 fatty acids consumption and the risk of recurrent VTE (RR = 0.45, 95\% CI: 0.25-0.81; P = 0.008). Conclusion: Although current evidence is still insufficient to demonstrate any relationship between fish consumption and the risk of VTE, omega-3 fatty acids consumption seems to be associated with a lower risk of both VTE and recurrent VTE. Further large well-designed prospective cohort studies are warranted to elaborate the issues examined in this study.},

Awareness and knowledge of brucellosis among occupational workers is considered an important aspect of brucellosis control in both humans and animals. The aim of this study was to explore the distributions of the pooled awareness level and the knowledge level of the disease worldwide. METHODS: A meta-analysis was carried out to obtain pooled brucellosis awareness levels and knowledge levels of respondents regarding the zoonotic nature of brucellosis, mode of brucellosis transmission, and brucellosis symptoms in animals and humans. The analysis was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses guidelines. RESULTS: A total of seventy-nine original articles reporting the brucellosis awareness levels of in populations from 22 countries were assessed. The total pooled awareness level of brucellosis was 55.5\%, and the pooled awareness levels regarding the zoonotic nature of brucellosis, mode of brucellosis transmission, signs of human brucellosis and signs of animal brucellosis were 37.6\%, 35.9\%, 41.6\%, and 28.4\% respectively. The pooled awareness level was higher than the brucellosis-related knowledge level. Subgroup analyses showed that no obvious differences in brucellosis awareness levels between high-risk populations in Asia and Africa. Health workers (including human health workers and veterinarians) had the greatest overall awareness and knowledge of human brucellosis. The overall awareness levels and knowledge levels of livestock owners (farmers) and herders were higher than those of dairy farmers and abattoir workers. In addition, awareness and knowledge levels were higher among people who were involved in bovine, caprine and ovine animal production or in caprine and ovine animal production than among people who were involved in only bovine animal production. CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient awareness and knowledge of brucellosis were observed in the original studies conducted mainly in Asia and Africa. Interventions to improve public knowledge about brucellosis are urgently needed.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Over the years, mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) have been pre-clinically applied in the treatment of variety kinds of diseases including asthma and chronic lung diseases. Aim of the current study was to systematically review and to conduct meta-analysis on the published studies of MSC treatment in asthma animal models. METHODS: Publications on the MSC and asthma treatment was thoroughly searched in the electronic databases. Statistical analysis was then performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (Version 3). Effect of MSC therapy on asthma model was assessed by Hedges's g with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs). Random effect model was used due to the heterogeneity between the studies. RESULTS: Meta-analysis of the 32 included studies showed that MSC transplantation was significantly in favor of attenuating lung injury and remodeling (Hedges's g = -9.104 ± 0.951 with 95\% CI: -10.969 ∼ -7.240, P {\textless} 0.001) and airway inflammation (Hedges's g = -4.146 ± 0.688 with 95\% CI: -5.495 ∼ -2.797, P {\textless} 0.001). The mechanism of MSC therapy in asthma seems to be regulating the balance of Th1 cytokine and Th2 cytokines (IFN-γ: Hedges's g = 4.779 ± 1.408 with 95\% CI: 1.099-2.725, P {\textless} 0.001; IL-4: Hedges's g = -10.781 ± 1.062 with 95\% CI: -12.863 ∼ -8.699, P {\textless} 0.001; IL-5: Hedges's g = -10.537 ± 1.269 with 95\% CI: -13.025 ∼ -8.050, P {\textless} 0.001; IL-13: Hedges's g = -6.773 ± 0.788 with 95\% CI: -8.318 ∼ -5.229, P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: Findings of the current systemic review suggested a potential role for MSCs in asthma treatment although it is still challenging in clinical practice. The mechanisms of MSCs in pre-clinical asthma treatment may be associated with attenuating airway inflammation through regulating Th1 and Th2 cytokines.},

  abstract	= {The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the association between the different factors of loading protocols and the long-term stability of micro-screws from biomechanical and histological viewpoints. Searches were performed on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang and CNKI databases for animal experiments comparing loading protocols and the long-term stability of micro-screws. Among 1011 detected papers, 16 studies met the eligibility criteria and were selected for analysis. Most studies showed medium methodological quality for evaluation of micro-screws' long-term stability. Five studies reported that loading would not destroy the long-term stability of micro-screws. Three studies indicated that low-intensity immediate loading or a 3-week minimal healing time was acceptable. Two studies reported that the loading magnitude was a controversial issue with regard to the micro-screws' long-term stability. Two studies suggested that counterclockwise loading could decrease the long-term stability of micro-screws. In conclusion, immediate loading below 100g force, healing time greater than 3 weeks, regular loading below 200g force and a clockwise direction of force supported the long-term stability of micro-screws. Further studies relating to the combination of varying loading conditions will be needed.},

With an evidence-based approach, this study investigated and analyzed the performance and degradation properties of biodegradable metals in animal models for bone defect repair to explore their potential clinical translation. Animal studies on bone defect repair with biodegradable metals in comparison with other traditional biomaterials were reviewed. Data was carefully collected after identification of population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design (PICOS), and following the inclusion criteria of biodegradable metals in animal studies. 30 publications on pure Mg, Mg alloys, pure Zn and Zn alloys were finally included after extraction from a collected database of 2543 publications. A qualitative systematic review and a quantitative meta-analysis were performed. Given the heterogeneity in animal model, anatomical site and critical size defect (CSD), biodegradable metals exhibited mixed effects on bone defect repair and degradation in animal studies in comparison with traditional non-degradable metals, biodegradable polymers, bioceramics, and autogenous bone grafts. The results indicated that there were limitations in the experimental design of the included studies, and quality of the evidence presented by the studies was very low. To enhance clinical translation of biodegradable metals, evidence-based research with data validity is needed. Future studies should adopt standardized experimental protocols in investigating the effects of biodegradable metals on bone defect repair with animal models.},

METHODS: The relevant articles were searched through PubMed database. The following keywords and search terms were used: "scaffolds," "patient," "clinic," "bone repair," "bone regeneration," "repairing bone defect," "repair of bone," "osteanagenesis," "osteanaphysis," and "osteoanagenesis." The articles were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, performed by two reviewers. RESULTS: A total of 373 articles were obtained using PubMed database. After screening, 20 articles were identified as relevant for the purpose of this systematic review. We collected the data of biological scaffolds and synthetic scaffolds. There are eight clinical studies of biological scaffolds included collagen, gelatin, and cellular scaffolds for bone healing. In addition, 12 clinical studies of synthetic scaffolds on HAp, TCP, bonelike, and their complex scaffolds for repairing bone defects were involved in this systematic review. CONCLUSIONS: There are a lot of clinical evidences showed that application of scaffolds had a good ability to facilitate bone repair and osteogenesis. However, the ideal and reliable guidelines are insufficiently applied and the number and quality of studies in this field remain to be improved.},

  abstract	= {Toxoplasma gondii infecting virtually all warm-blooded animals, including humans, is an intracellular protozoan parasite. The immunocompromised patients or pregnant women infected by Toxoplasma usually can cause encephalitis or abortion. Deer are also the important intermediate host of the parasite and people can be infected by ingesting the undercooked venison. Therefore, to raise the attention of the researchers and T. gondii infection on people in deer, we conducted the meta-analysis. All potential publications on the T. gondii infection in deer were retrieved by searching the PubMed, ScienceDirect, Springer- Link, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang, and VIP Chinese Journal Databases. Finally, a total of 48 publications were included. The pooled seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in deer was 22.92\% (95\% CI 17.89-28.38) calculated by the random effect model. The seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in deer was the lowest in Asia (12.72\%, 95\% CI 6.29-20.89), and the highest in North America (32.21\%, 95\% CI 20.32-45.39). The highest point estimate of deer T. gondii in detection method subgroup was using MAT (31.28\%, 95\% CI 20.15-43.61). The estimated pooled seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in elk (63.50\%, 95\% CI 50.01-76.01) was higher than other types of deer. Our meta-regression analysis found that the subgroups including region, sampling year, age, climate, and deer species may be the main heterogeneous source in our meta-analysis. It is necessary to monitor the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in deer at all times. Furthermore, people should be taken to precautions when ingesting the venison by cooking it well before serving to prevent the T. gondii infection via eating venison.},

  abstract	= {Previous studies have demonstrated that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) transplantation is a promising treatment strategy for pulmonary fibrosis. Although encouraging results have been obtained using animal models of bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis, it is evident that transplantation of BMSCs at various time-points after BLM administration has produced different results in terms of treatment efficacy. To shed light on the potential utility of BMSCs for the treatment of lung disease, the present study performed a meta-analysis to estimate the efficacy of BMSCs in animal models of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and compare early transplantation (BMSCs injected on the same day after administration of BLM) with late transplantation (BMSCs injected on the 14th day after administration of BLM). Relevant studies were retrieved from the MEDLINE, PubMed, Chinese Knowledge Infrastructure and WanFang databases using a comprehensive search approach. A total of 6 studies involving 228 model rats were included. Meta-analysis indicated that early BMSC transplantation was able to prevent or reduce BLM-induced alveolitis and pulmonary fibrosis, while late BMSC transplantation was able to reduce alveolitis, but there was no significant evidence regarding improvement of pulmonary fibrosis. Although BMSC therapy was identified to be generally beneficial in rodent models of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, the efficacy of early transplantation appears to be more satisfactory; overall, the efficacy of transplantation of BMSCs at the acute inflammatory phase was more effective compared with that at the chronic fibrosis stage. Of note, regarding alveolitis and pulmonary fibrosis scores after late transplantation of BMSCs, the sensitivity analysis revealed that the scores were less stable; thus, this result must be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, the quality and methodology of the included studies was comparatively low. Therefore, higher-quality and more rigorous studies are required to validate the results of the present meta-analysis in the future.},

  abstract	= {Melatonin is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent that is showing promising results in acute brain injury. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the pre-clinical evidence on the effectiveness of melatonin in improving outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We searched mainstream databases from the inception to the end of June 2020. Outcomes were measured by neurobehavioral scores or brain water content. Meta-analyses were performed with Stata 12.0 and Review Manager 5.3. Finally, 8 articles published from 2008 to 2019 met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of pre-clinical data revealed an overall positive effect on neurobehavioral outcome with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of -0.81 (95\% CI: -1.47, -0.15; p = 0.016) with significant heterogeneity (Q = 41.49, I(2) = 68.7\%; p = 0.000). Further subgroup analysis were performed from methodological differences, especially dose and timing of treatments. Furthermore, melatonin reduced cerebral edema by an SMD of -0.78 (95\% CI: -1.23, -0.34; p = 0.001) with low heterogeneity. In conclusion, melatonin treatment significantly improves both behavioral and pathological outcomes in animal models of ICH. In addition, the results should be interpreted in light of the limitations in experimental design and methodological quality of the studies included in the meta-analysis.},

Internet search was performed in duplicate using PubMed, MEDLINE, Ovid and Embase databases (without restrictions on publication date). The Animal Research Reporting in In Vivo Experiments guidelines were used to evaluate the quality of selected studies. Following screening, 12 studies were eligible for the review. Studies with average quality coefficients predominated (66.67\%), followed by poor (25\%) and excellent (8.33\%) quality coefficients. Minimum quality scores were assigned to the Animal Research Reporting in In Vivo Experiments guideline items: housing and husbandry (9), allocation (11), outcomes (12), interpretation (18) and generalizability (19). Sprague-Dawley rats were the most frequently used (50\%) species, and most studies had a sample size of more than 30 (58.33\%). A defect dimension of 5 mm was the most common (33.33\%). The biological hydroxyapatite composite scaffold was common (50\%), and the bioactive factors were bone morphogenetic protein-2 (50\%) and recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (50\%). Histomorphometric results showed that bone morphogenetic protein-2 enhanced the capacity to regenerate bone considerably. In addition, scaffolds with bone morphogenetic protein-2 resulted in a significant increase in the blood vessel in the new bone. The findings suggested that data on animal experiments of hydroxyapatite scaffold coated with bone morphogenetic protein-2 in murine calvarial defect models lack homogeneity. Animal experiment should follow the Animal Research Reporting in In Vivo Experiments guidelines to promote the high quality, integrity and reproducibility. This systematic review suggested that bone morphogenetic protein-2 enhanced the capacity to regenerate bone and the angiogenesis in the new bone.},

  abstract	= {Although exposure to high levels of microbial bioaerosols can be linked to the deterioration of the human respiratory system, precise exposure levels responsible for such effects are still unknown. A previous systematic review concluded that there was not enough information in the studies in humans to derive an exposure-response relationship. Thus, the aim of this systematic review was to derive exposure limits for microbial bioaerosols based on health effects in experimental animal studies. A systematic search was done in MEDLINE (PubMed) for long-term in vivo exposure of the respiratory system via inhalation of a quantified microbial bioaerosol. A total of n = 301 studies were retrieved. Abstract screening using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria was followed by full-text screening and standardized data extraction of study characteristics and measured outcomes. As a result, four suitable studies were identified where mice or guinea pigs were exposed for 4-12 weeks to a previously described mixture of fungal spores or conidia via inhalation. The number of macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes following subchronic exposure has been reported by all included papers and suggested a dose- and time-dependent relationship. Significant inflammation was observed following subacute exposure to Aspergillus fumigatus. However, the outcomes of the studies could not be directly compared due to the large degree of variation and poor description of the exposure conditions. It is our conclusion that more experimental research needs to be done with the specific aim of establishing a No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL) and a Lowest-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (LOAEL) for exposure to microbial bioaerosols in ambient air. Expertise of both exposure and outcome assessment should be brought together to enable standardization of experimental animal studies with properly generated aerosols aiming to derive health-based exposure limits.},

  abstract	= {A systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis (MA) were performed to evaluate the effects of different energy levels (metabolizable energy, ME) and crude protein (CP), supplied to pregnant cows, on weight of their progenies at 60 (BW60), 100 (BW100), 180 (BW180) and 205 (BW205) days of age, average daily gain (ADG), and weight, age, loin eye area (LEA), marbling and fat thickness (FT) at slaughter. The SR was performed on two electronic databases. The MA for random effects was performed for each response variable separately. The BW60 was reduced (P{\textless}0.001; I2 = 78.9\%) when cows consumed CP and ME above the required levels during the third trimester of pregnancy (3TRI). The BW205 was lower (P{\textless}0.001; I2 = 92.6\%) when cows consumed ME above the recommended levels in the second trimester of pregnancy (2TRI) and 3TRI. Conversely, the ADG was higher when cows consumed CP (P = 0.032; I2 = 96.1\%) and ME (P{\textless}0.001; I2 = 96.1\%) above the required levels. The steers whose mothers consumed CP and ME above the required levels during the 3TRI were slaughtered 5.5 days earlier (P = 0.015; I2 = 98.5\%) compared to other steers. The marbling was higher (P{\textless}0.001; I2 = 91.7\%) in calves born to mothers consuming CP and ME above the recommended levels, regardless of the gestation phase. The FT was higher (P{\textless}0.001; I2 = 0\%) in the offspring of cows that consumed CP and ME above the required levels during the 3TRI. Thus, CP and ME intake, at levels higher than those recommended by the NRC, by pregnant cows in the 3TRI reduces the progeny weight up to 205 days of age. However, this is advantageous during the finishing phase, as it reduces slaughter age and increases the ADG and carcass quality by improving marbling and FT.},

  abstract	= {The prenatal development of cattle has influence on productive performance throughout postnatal life. The number of muscle and fat cells that the animal will have throughout its life is determined in the foetal stage and is influenced by nutrition of the pregnant cow. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of different energy levels (total digestible nutrient, TDN) and crude protein (CP) supplied to pregnant cows on foetal weight at 4 (FW4) and 8 months (FW8) and calf birth weight (CBW). Four studies and six trials involving 170 animals were assessed for FW4; four studies, four trials and 156 animals for FW8 and 48 studies, 125 trials and 9053 animals for CBW. High heterogeneity across studies was presented in FW4 (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=94.4\%), FW8 (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=91.08\%) and CBW (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=96.9\%). Dietary TDN and CP levels did not influence FW4. The FW8 was reduced by 2.24 kg when cows were fed 100\% of their CP and TDN requirements (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=0\%), relative to those fed 70\% of their requirements during the first and second trimesters. The CBW was reduced by 0.45 kg (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=96.9\%) when cows were fed 130\% of their CP requirements relative to other dietary CP levels. When cows were fed 140\% of their TDN requirements, CBW decreased by 2.71 kg (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=98.3\%) relative to other TDN levels. Dietary energy or CP levels fed above the requirements to pregnant cows restrict foetal development and CBW.},

  abstract	= {Schistosomiasis control is heavily reliant on the drug praziquantel (PZQ), which is used as preventive chemotherapy as part of national helminth control strategies. Given the heavy reliance on PZQ for mass drug administration, there has been considerable research on the potential of parasites developing resistance to the drug, resulting in decreased drug efficacy. However, there have been comparatively fewer studies of other factors that can potentially alter PZQ efficacy. Here, we investigate whether host PZQ metabolism contributes towards variable cure rates. We evaluate factors that can influence the metabolism of PZQ and the resultant effect on the efficacy of PZQ treatment to determine factors that potentially influence an individual's response to the drug. The literature search was directed at published studies from three online databases: Web of Science, PubMed, and EMBASE. The search terms for the review comprised of ([praziquantel OR PZQ] AND [schistosom* OR bilharzia] AND [pharmaco*]) and included studies evaluating PZQ metabolism. Publications were categorised into pharmacokinetics, drug-drug interactions, pharmacogenetics, and metabolite analysis. Forty publications describing human and experimental studies fitted the inclusion criteria and were subjected to data extraction and analysis. The analyses showed that variable exposure to PZQ was associated with alterations in the liver's capacity to metabolise PZQ and observed drug-drug interactions. Other factors influencing the efficacy of PZQ were brand, formulation, and co-administered food. Although some work has been performed on metabolite identification, there was minimal information on PZQ's metabolic pathway, and no pharmacogenetics studies were identified. The study indicated that in both human and experimental studies alterations in the liver's capacity to metabolise PZQ as well as drug-drug interactions affected systemic levels of PZQ that could result in variable cure rates. The study confirmed previous findings of higher antischistosomal activity of (R)-PZQ enantiomer when administered alone compared to the racemate at the same dose as well as improved efficacy when the drug is administered with food. The study also highlighted the need for more comprehensive studies of the PZQ metabolic pathway and PZQ pharmacogenetic studies in humans.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: To review currently available evidence on the effect of cow-milk proteins supplementation (CPS) on health in the elderly. METHODS: Five electronic databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched for studies about CPS among older people. All types of publications were included, with the exception of systematic reviews, meta-analyses, opinion letters, editorials, case reports, conference abstracts and comments. An additional search in Google Scholar and a manual review of the reference lists were performed. RESULTS: Overall, 103 studies were included. Several studies explored the role of CPS in the preservation or improvement of muscle mass among healthy subjects (40 studies) and pre-frail, frail or sarcopenic patients (14), with evidence of beneficial effects. Other studies assessed the effect of CPS on bones (12), cardiovascular disease (8), inflamm-aging (7), chronic pulmonary disease (4), neurocognitive function (4), and vaccines (2), with weak evidence of positive effects. Seven studies in the field of protein metabolism investigated the role of CPS as an important contributor to nutritional needs. Other investigational areas are considered in the last five studies. CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effects of CPS in achieving aged-related nutritional goals, in preserving muscle mass and in recovering after hospitalization may be particularly relevant in the elderly.},

  abstract	= {Wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons of the spinal dorsal horn respond to a wide range of innocuous and noxious mechanical stimulation and encode the intensity of mechanical stimuli as changes in firing rate. However, there are inconsistent findings regarding whether WDR neuron stimulus encoding activity is altered in pathological pain states. This inconsistency may arise from differences in the pain models used or in the experimental conditions themselves. In this study, we use a meta-regression approach to examine which variables modulate and determine WDR activity. We pooled data from in vivo electrophysiological studies of WDR activity evoked by von Frey filament stimulation of the hind paw in rats across a number of pathological pain models. We observed that WDR firing rate was better predicted by the calculated pressure of von Frey stimulation rather than applied filament force, as reported in all studies. The pressure-evoked firing rate of WDR neurons was not altered by any experimental pain model except for arthritis and inflammation models, where mechanical stimuli evoked a higher firing rate than controls. Conversely, there was a consistent increase in the spontaneous firing rate of WDR neurons in neuropathic pain, arthritis and inflammation, and chemoneuropathy pain models. Overall, these data indicate that changes in WDR encoding of applied pressure are unlikely to significantly contribute to pathological sensory processing but suggest a possible role for these neurons in spontaneous pain.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Dog-assisted therapy (DAT) is a non-pharmacological intervention based on the interaction between patients and dogs, which has been proposed to help adults with dementia. However, evidence to support it is lacking. Thus, we aim to evaluate the effects of DAT on this population and to assess the certainty of the evidence of the RCTs estimates. METHODS: A systematic search was performed. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental (QE) controlled studies published up to March 2018, which evaluated the beneficial and deleterious effects of DAT in adults with dementia. Mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) and their 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) were calculated and random effects meta-analyses were performed. Certainty of evidence was assessed for RCTs estimates using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The study protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018090434). RESULTS: Ten studies (six RCTs and four QE controlled studies) were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analysis of RCTs showed no effect of DAT in daily life activities (SMD: 0.16; 95\% CI: -0.80 to 1.12), depression (SMD: -0.45; 95\% CI: -2.81 to 1.91), agitation (SDM: -1.12; 95\% CI: -2.67 to 0.43), quality of life (SDM: 0.16; 95\% CI: -0.41 to 0.73), and cognitive impairment (SDM: -0.52; 95\% CI: -1.33 to 0.30), but it found a beneficial effect in apathy (1 study, n = 37, MD: 1.81; 95\% CI: 1.26 to 2.36). All outcomes had a very low certainty of evidence according to GRADE methodology. CONCLUSIONS: RCTs evidence of very low certainty suggests that, in adults with dementia, DAT has no effect in daily life activities, depression, agitation, quality of life, and cognitive impairment, although one small study found an apparent beneficial effect in apathy. More well-designed and correctly reported studies are needed in order to provide a conclusion. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CRD42018090434 (PROSPERO).},

  abstract	= {A meta-analysis integrating results of 40 selenium (Se) supplementation experiments that originated from 35 different controlled randomized trials was carried out in an attempt to identify significant factors that affect tissue Se accumulation in chicken. Examined factors included: Se source (12 different sources examined), type of chicken (laying hens or broilers), age of birds at the beginning of supplementation, duration of supplementation, year during which the study was conducted, sex of birds, number of chickens per treatment, method of analysis, tissue type, concentration of Se determined and Se added to feed. A correlation analysis was also carried out between tissue Se concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity. Data analysis showed that the factors significantly affecting tissue Se concentration include type of chicken (P=0.006), type of tissue (P{\textless}0.001) and the analytical method used (P=0.014). Although Se source was not found to affect tissue Se concentration (overall P{\textgreater}0.05), certain inorganic (sodium selenite), calcium selenite, sodium selenate and organic sources (B-Traxim Se), Se-yeast, Se-malt, Se-enriched cabbage and Se-enriched garlic as well as background Se level from feed ingredients were found to significantly affect tissue Se concentration. The Se accumulation rate (estimated as linear regression coefficient of Se concentrations to Se added to feed) discriminated between the various tissues with highest values estimated in the leg muscle and lowest in blood plasma. Correlation analysis has also shown that tissue Se concentration (pooled data) was correlated to Se added to feed (r=0.529, P{\textless}0.01, log values) and to glutathione peroxidase activity (r=0.332, P=0.0478), with the latter not being correlated with Se added to feed. Although significant factors affecting Se concentration were reported in the present study, they do not necessarily indicate the in vivo function of the antioxidant system or the level of accumulated Se as other factors, not examined in the present study, may interact at the level of trace element absorption, distribution and retention.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Cysticercosis is caused by the invasion of human or pig tissues by the metacestode larval stage of Taenia solium. In Europe, the disease was endemic in the past but the autochthonous natural life cycle of the parasite is currently completed very rarely. Recently, imported cases have increased in parallel to the increased number of migrations and international travels. The lack of specific surveillance systems for cysticercosis leads to underestimation of the epidemiological and clinical impacts. OBJECTIVES: To review the available data on epidemiology and management of cysticercosis in Europe. METHODS: A review of literature on human cysticercosis and T. solium taeniasis in Europe published between 1990-2011 was conducted. RESULTS: Out of 846 cysticercosis cases described in the literature, 522 cases were autochthonous and 324 cases were imported. The majority (70.1\%) of the autochthonous cases were diagnosed in Portugal from 1983 and 1994. Imported cases of which 242 (74.7\%) diagnosed in migrants and 57 (17.6\%) in European travellers, showed an increasing trend. Most of imported cases were acquired in Latin America (69.8\% of migrants and 44.0\% of travellers). The majority of imported cases were diagnosed in Spain (47.5\%), France (16.7\%) and Italy (8.3\%). One third of neurosurgical procedures were performed because the suspected diagnosis was cerebral neoplasm. Sixty eight autochthonous and 5 imported T. solium taeniasis cases were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Cysticercosis remains a challenge for European care providers, since they are often poorly aware of this infection and have little familiarity in managing this disease. Cysticercosis should be included among mandatory reportable diseases, in order to improve the accuracy of epidemiological information. European health care providers might benefit from a transfer of knowledge from colleagues working in endemic areas and the development of shared diagnostic and therapeutic processes would have impact on the quality of the European health systems.},

  abstract	= {This study examined the extent by which changes in the concentrate level and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content in the diet as well as the severity of acidotic insult, measured as the duration time of rumen pH below 6.0 and daily mean rumen pH, and the concentration of endotoxin in the rumen fluid are involved in the development of inflammatory conditions in cattle. A meta-analytical approach accounting for inter- and intraexperimental variation was used to generate prediction models, and data from recent studies were used to parameterize these models. A total of 10 recently conducted experiments with 43 different dietary treatments fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in this study. Diets of all of the experiments included in this meta-analysis were based on rapidly degradable grain sources, such as barley and wheat, and the findings of this study apply only to these kinds of diets. Data indicated that greater levels of concentrate in the diet were associated with increased concentrations of rumen endotoxin (R(2)=0.27), plasma haptoglobin (R(2)=0.19), and serum amyloid A (SAA) level (R(2)=0.46). Similar correlations, but in opposite directions, were observed between dietary NDF content and rumen endotoxin (R(2)=0.39) and plasma SAA concentrations (R(2)=0.22). The meta-analysis revealed that the relationships between those variables were not linear. Additionally, the breakpoint model fitted to the data of rumen endotoxin, plasma haptoglobin, and SAA indicated the presence of a threshold level of dietary concentrate and NDF, above which those responses became linear to increasing amounts of concentrate or decreasing contents of NDF in the diet. Also, feeding cattle more than 44.1\% concentrate or less than 39.2\% NDF in the diet was associated with a linear increase in the risk of systemic inflammation. Low daily mean rumen pH (R(2)=0.38) and duration of rumen pH {\textless}6.0 (R(2)=0.59) were associated with increased concentrations of endotoxin in the rumen fluid; although those events were not always associated with systemic inflammation. Accordingly, only 15 to 21\% of the overall variation in the responses of SAA was explained by variables of rumen pH, whereas the concentrate level in the diet accounted for 46\% of this variation. In conclusion, data from this study indicated the presence of thresholds of dietary concentrate and NDF levels in the diets based on rapidly fermentable grains beyond which the risk of systemic inflammation in cattle increases linearly.},

This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the evidence for an association between domestic exposure to food-producing animals and cases of human diarrhea and specific enteric infections. We performed a systematic review of available literature to examine domestic livestock and poultry as risk factors for diarrhea and applied pre-determined quality criteria. Where possible, we carried out meta-analysis of specific animal-pathogen pairs. We found consistent evidence of a positive association between exposure to domestic food-producing animals and diarrheal illness across a range of animal exposures and enteric pathogens. Out of 29 studies included in the review, 20 (69.0\%) reported a positive association between domestic animal exposure and diarrhea. Domestic exposure to poultry revealed a substantial association with human campylobacteriosis (OR 2.73, 95\% CI 1.90-3.93). Our results suggest that domestic poultry and livestock exposures are associated with diarrheal illness in humans. Failure to ascertain the microbial cause of disease may mask this effect. Exposure to domestic animals should be considered a risk factor for human diarrheal illness and additional studies may identify potential mitigation strategies to address this risk.},

Despite the fact that numerous individual studies and a few meta-analyses had been conducted, how grazing, especially its intensity, affects belowground C and N cycling in grasslands remains unclear. In this study, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of 115 published studies to examine the responses of 19 variables associated with belowground C and N cycling to livestock grazing in global grasslands. Our results showed that, on average, grazing significantly decreased belowground C and N pools in grassland ecosystems, with the largest decreases in microbial biomass C and N (21.62\% and 24.40\%, respectively). In contrast, belowground fluxes, including soil respiration, soil net N mineralization and soil N nitrification increased by 4.25\%, 34.67\% and 25.87\%, respectively, in grazed grasslands compared to ungrazed ones. More importantly, grazing intensity significantly affected the magnitude (even direction) of changes in the majority of the assessed belowground C and N pools and fluxes, and C : N ratio as well as soil moisture. Specifically,light grazing contributed to soil C and N sequestration whereas moderate and heavy grazing significantly increased C and N losses. In addition, soil depth, livestock type and climatic conditions influenced the responses of selected variables to livestock grazing to some degree. Our findings highlight the importance of the effects of grazing intensity on belowground C and N cycling, which may need to be incorporated into regional and global models for predicting effects of human disturbance on global grasslands and assessing the climate-biosphere feedbacks.},

  abstract	= {Literature data on utilization of dietary N were analyzed by using meta-analytic procedures for growing milk-fed dairy calves and weaned dairy heifers. The objective was to statistically assess N utilization and excretion in growing dairy cattle when dietary N was altered in otherwise balanced rations at various stages of growth. Studies meeting the selection criteria included data from 16 published papers encompassing 94 distinct observations made on 217 animals. Of these, 6 studied calves were fed milk or milk protein-based milk replacer [milk-fed; 30 to 81 kg of body weight (BW)] with 37 different dietary treatments, and 10 experiments studied heifers receiving diets based on forage, concentrates, or a combination of forage and concentrates (weaned; 56 to 472 kg of BW) with 57 different dietary treatments. Mixed model and fixed effect regression analyses were used to evaluate responses to additional dietary N. True digestibility of dietary N was 100.4\% for milk-fed calves and 96.4\% for weaned heifers, with corresponding basal fecal N excretion values of 3.05 and 6.51 g of N/kg of dry matter intake. Urinary N (g of N/kg of BW(0.75)) was consistently greater for milk-fed calves, but the response to increasing N intake was parallel to the response for weaned heifers. Whether using a mixed model approach or a fixed effect approach to account for metabolizable energy intake, BW, and dry matter intake, milk-fed calves retained more N per kilogram of BW(0.75) than weaned heifers. However, marginal efficiency of N utilization responded as a continuous function of BW, as opposed to a bimodal response associated with diet type. Gross N efficiency (GNE) responded quadratically to N intake and was greater for milk-fed calves than for weaned heifers. Linear and quadratic coefficients of this function did not differ between diet types, indicating that the response in gross N efficiency to additional N intake was not different between diet groups; rather, the absolute level obtainable differed. Dietary CP concentrations of 18.9\% for milk-fed calves and 14.2\% for weaned heifers were found to maximize GNE; 22.5\% MJ of crude protein/MJ of ME was found to maximize GNE for both groups. Equations are discussed relative to the requirements to replace basal N losses and efficiency of N utilization.},

A database of 64 papers meeting the selection criteria was developed evaluating postruminally infused dl-methionine (9 papers with 18 control diets and 35 treatment comparisons), 2-hydroxy-4-methylthio butanoic acid (HMTBa) provided as either a liquid or Ca salt form (17 papers with 34 control diets and 46 treatment comparisons), Mepron (Evonik Industries, Essen, Germany; 18 papers with 35 control diets and 42 treatment comparisons), and Smartamine (Adisseo Inc., Antony, France; 20 papers with 30 control diets and 39 treatment comparisons). Dietary ingredients and their accompanying nutritional compositions as described in the reports were entered into the Cornell-Penn-Miner software to model the diets and to predict nutrients that were not reported in the original publication. Data were analyzed using a weighted analysis of response to supplementation compared with the intraexperiment control, as well as through a regression analysis to changing dietary MP Met. Data included in the analysis were from experiments published between 1970 and 2011 with cows supplemented with between 3.5 and 67.9 g of Met or its equivalent from HMTBa. Cows supplemented with Smartamine consumed more, whereas cows supplemented with Mepron consumed less DM compared with controls. Milk yield did not significantly respond to Met supplementation, although it tended to increase for cows supplemented with HMTBa and Mepron. Milk protein yield was increased due to supplementation from all sources or from infusion, and protein concentration was greater for all supplements or infusion of dl-Met, except for cows supplemented with HMTBa. Irrespective of Met source, milk protein yield increased 2.23 g of protein/g of MP Met until reaching the breakpoint. Milk fat yield was increased for Mepron and HMTBa, whereas milk fat concentration was increased for infused dl-Met and for cows supplemented with HMTBa. Based on regression analysis, response of milk fat yield to Met supplementation was not different for infused dl-Met, Mepron, and Smartamine (1.87 g of fat/g of MP Met), whereas the response to HMTBa was significantly greater at 5.38 g of fat/g of MP Met.},

Databases of Web of Science, PubMed, and Wan Fang Med Online were retrieved up to Jan 31th, 2018. Eligible studies were identified based on defined inclusion criteria. Summarized results of relative risk (RR) with corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random effects model. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias were also performed. The final analysis in this report included a total of 9 articles. The summarized RR and 95\%CI from 8 studies for dietary fresh fish intake and glioma risk was 0.823 (95\%CI= 0.698-0.970), with no evidence of significant between-study heterogeneity (I2=43.6\%, P=0.088). Moreover, positive associations were also found both in Caucasian populations and Asia populations. Seven studies were used to assess the relationship between dietary processed fish intake and the risk of glioma. Significantly increased risk of glioma was found for the highest category of dietary processed fish intake [summarized RR= 1.554, 95\%CI= 1.169-2.066, I2= 72.1\%, P= 0.001], especially among Caucasian populations. No publication bias was found. In summary, findings from this meta-analysis concluded that dietary fresh fish intake could reduce the risk of glioma. However, very high processed fish intake had a significant association with increased glioma risk.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to perform a systematic review of the literature on the cerebrovascular/cerebral blood flow (CBF) effects of ketamine in both animal and human subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, BIOSIS, EMBASE, Global Health, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library from inception to December 2014. Two reviewers independently identified all manuscripts pertaining to the administration of ketamine in both human and animal subjects in which the impact on CBF/cerebral vasculature was recorded by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, xenon computed tomography, transcranial Doppler velocities, arteriovenous difference in N2O method of CBF measurement, cerebral digital subtraction angiography, or any other objective means of CBF determination. RESULTS: We identified 38 animal studies with various animal models studied. Overall there was a trend to a direct vasodilatory effect of ketamine on the cerebral vasculature, with a trend in most studies to an increase or regional CBF (rCBF) or global CBF.Twenty human studies were identified. The majority displayed an increase in rCBF and global CBF on imaging in patients without neurological illness. CONCLUSIONS: Animal models indicate an increase in global CBF and rCBF with ketamine administration, with a trend to vasodilation of medium-sized intracranial vessels through a calcium-dependent mechanism. Human studies display an Oxford 2b, Grading of Recommendation Assessment Development and Education C, level of evidence to support a trend to increased global CBF and rCBF with ketamine administration in both healthy volunteers and elective surgical patients without neurological illness.},

  abstract	= {Background: With the increasing ages of the general population, the incidence of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is also rising, and KOA has become a major health problem worldwide. Recently, medicinal plants and their secondary metabolites have gained interest due to their activity in treating KOA. In this paper, a comprehensive systematic review of the literature was performed concerning the effects of medicinal plant extracts and natural compounds against KOA in recent years. The related molecular pathways of natural compounds against KOA were summarized, and the possible crosstalk among components in chondrocytes was discussed to propose possible solutions for the current situation of treating KOA. Purpose: This review focused on the molecular mechanisms by which medicinal plants and their secondary metabolites act against KOA. Methods: Literature searches were performed in the PUBMED, Embase, Science Direct, and Web of Science databases for a 10-year period from 2011 to 2022 with the search terms "medicinal plants", "bioactive compounds", "natural products", "phytochemical", "knee osteoarthritis", "knee joint osteoarthritis", "knee osteoarthritis", "osteoarthritis of the knee", and "osteoarthritis of knee joint". Results: According to the results, substantial plant extracts and secondary metabolites show a positive effect in fighting KOA. Plant extracts and their secondary metabolites can affect the diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of KOA. Natural products inhibit the expression of MMP1, MMP3, MMP19, syndecan IV, ADAMTS-4, ADAMTS-5, iNOS, COX-2, collagenases, IL-6, IL-1beta, and TNF-a in vitro and in vivo and. Cytokines also upregulate the expression of collagen II and aggrecan. The main signaling pathways affected by the extracts and isolated compounds include AMPK, SIRT, NLRP3, MAPKs, PI3K/AKT, mTOR, NF-B, WNT/beta-catenin, JAK/STAT3, and NRF2, as well as the cell death modes apoptosis, autophagy, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis. Conclusion: The role of secondary metabolites in different signaling pathways supplies a better understanding of their potential to develop further curative options for KOA.},

For mammals, including dogs, a balanced diet and sufficient intake of selenium are important for correct function of metabolism. As for selenium poisoning, there are no naturally occurring cases known. Nowadays, we do not encounter clinical signs of its deficiency either, but it can be subclinical. For now, the most reliable method of assessing selenium status of a dog is measuring serum or plasma levels. Levels in full blood can be measured too, but there are no reference values. The use of glutathione peroxidase as an indirect assay is questionable in canines. Commercial dog food manufactures follow recommendations for minimal and maximal selenium levels and so dogs fed commercial diets should have balanced intake of selenium. For dogs fed home-made diets, complex data are missing. However, subclinical deficiency seems to affect, for example, male fertility or recovery from parasitical diseases. Very interesting is the role of selenium in prevention and treatment of cancer.},

Additionally, in this review we highlight the main routes of organic pollutant entry into soil, and discuss the adverse effects on the soil ecosystem. We then systematically review the mechanisms underlying organic pollutant toxicity to earthworms, including oxidative stress, energy and lipid metabolism disturbances, neurological toxicity, intestinal inflammation and injury, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and reproductive toxicity. We conclude by discussing future research perspectives, focusing on environmentally relevant concentrations and conditions, novel data processing approaches, technologies, and detoxification and mitigation methods.

  abstract	= {Viruses have a high mutation rate, and, thus, there is a continual emergence of new antiviral-resistant strains. Therefore, it becomes imperative to explore and develop new antiviral compounds continually. The search for pharmacological substances of plant origin that are effective against animal viruses, which have a high mortality rate or cause large economic losses, has garnered interest in the last few decades. This systematic review compiles 130 plant species that exhibit antiviral activity on 37 different virus species causing serious diseases in animals. The kind of extract, fraction, or compound exhibiting the antiviral activity and the design of the trial were particularly considered for review. The literature revealed details regarding plant species exhibiting antiviral activities against pathogenic animal virus species of the following families-Herpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae, Poxviridae, Nimaviridae, Coronaviridae, Reoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae-that cause infections, among others, in poultry, cattle, pigs, horses, shrimps, and fish. Overall, 30 plant species exhibited activity against various influenza viruses, most of them causing avian influenza. Furthermore, 30 plant species were noted to be active against Newcastle disease virus. In addition, regarding the pathogens most frequently investigated, this review provides a compilation of 20 plant species active against bovine herpesvirus, 16 against fowlpox virus, 12 against white spot syndrome virus in marine shrimps, and 10 against suide herpesvirus. Nevertheless, some plant extracts, particularly their compounds, are promising candidates for the development of new antiviral remedies, which are urgently required.},

  doi		= {10.1186/s40104-020-00522-6},
  abstract	= {Lactose plays a crucial role in the growth performance of pigs at weaning because it is a palatable and easily digestible energy source that eases the transition from milk to solid feed. However, the digestibility of lactose declines after weaning due to a reduction in endogenous lactase activity in piglets. As a result, some lactose may be fermented in the gastrointestinal tract of pigs. Fermentation of lactose by intestinal microbiota yields lactic acid and volatile fatty acids, which may positively regulate the intestinal environment and microbiome, resulting in improved gastrointestinal health of weanling pigs. We hypothesize that the prebiotic effect of lactose may play a larger role in weanling pig nutrition as the global feed industry strives to reduce antibiotic usage and pharmacological levels of zinc oxide and supra-nutritional levels of copper. Evidence presented in this review indicates that high dietary lactose improves growth performance of piglets, as well as the growth of beneficial bacteria, particularly Lactobacillus, with the positive effects being more pronounced in the first 2 weeks after weaning. However, the risk of post-weaning diarrhea may increase as pigs get older due to reduced lactase activity, high dietary lactose concentrations, and larger feed intakes, all of which may lead to excessive lactose fermentation in the intestine of the pig. Therefore, dietary lactose levels exert different effects on growth performance and gastrointestinal physiological functions in different feeding phases of weanling pigs. However, no formal recommendation of lactose for weanling pigs has been reported. A meta-analysis approach was used to determine that diets fed to swine should include 20\%, 15\%, and 0 lactose from d 0-7, d 7-14, and d 14-35 post-weaning, respectively. However, sustainable swine production demands that economics must also be taken into account as lactose and lactose containing ingredients are expensive. Therefore, alternatives to lactose, so called "lactose equivalents" have also been studied in an effort to decrease feed cost while maintaining piglet performance with lower dietary lactose inclusions. In summary, the present review investigated dose-response effects of dietary lactose supplementation to exert positive responses and begin to elucidate its mechanisms of action in post-weaning pig diets. The results may help to replace some or all lactose in the diet of weanling pigs, while improving production economics given the high cost of lactose and availability in some swine production markets.},

The objective of our systematic review was to assess the impact of biological sex on treatment response to fluid and antibiotic therapy in animal models of sepsis. Furthermore, we provide a narrative elaboration of sex-dependent differences in preclinical models of sepsis. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and Embase were searched from inception to March 16, 2020. STUDY SELECTION: All studies reporting sex-stratified data comparing antibiotics and/or fluid resuscitation with a placebo or no treatment arm in an in vivo model of sepsis were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Outcomes of interest were mortality (primary) and organ dysfunction (secondary). Risk of bias was assessed. Study selection and data extraction were conducted independently and in duplicate. DATA SYNTHESIS: The systematic search returned 2,649 unique studies, and two met inclusion criteria. Both studies used cecal ligation and puncture models with imipenem/cilastatin antibiotics. No eligible studies investigated fluids. In one study, antibiotic therapy significantly reduced mortality in male, but not female, animals. The other study reported no sex differences in organ dysfunction. Both studies were deemed to be at a high overall risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: There is a remarkable and concerning paucity of data investigating sex-dependent differences in fluid and antibiotic therapy for the treatment of sepsis in animal models. This may reflect poor awareness of the importance of investigating sex-dependent differences. Our discussion therefore expands on general concepts of sex and gender in biomedical research and sex-dependent differences in key areas of sepsis research such as the cardiovascular system, immunometabolism, the microbiome, and epigenetics. Finally, we discuss current clinical knowledge, the potential for reverse translation, and directions for future studies. REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42020192738.},

Marine mammals may be vulnerable to microplastic exposure from the environment, via direct ingestion from sea water, and indirect uptake from their prey. Here we present the first systematic review of literature on microplastics and marine mammals, composing of 30 studies in total. The majority of studies examined the gastrointestinal tracts of beached, bycaught or hunted cetaceans and pinnipeds, and found that microplastics were present in all but one study, and the abundance varied between 0 and 88 particles per animal. Additionally, microplastics in pinniped scats (faeces) were detected in eight out of ten studies, with incidences ranging from 0\% of animals to 100\%. Our review highlights considerable methodological and reporting deficiencies and differences among papers, making comparisons and extrapolation across studies difficult. We suggest best practices to avoid these issues in future studies. In addition to empirical studies that quantified microplastics in animals and scat, ten studies out of 30 (all focussing on cetaceans) tried to estimate the risk of exposure using two main approaches; i) overlaying microplastic in the environment (water or prey) with cetacean habitat or ii) proposing biological or chemical biomarkers of exposure. We discuss advice and best practices on research into the exposure and impact of microplastics in marine mammals. This work on marine ecosystem health indicator species will provide valuable and comparable information in the future.},

  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Blastocystis sp. affects a wide variety of animals and is the most common protozoan in human fecal samples with potential pandemic distribution. In the present study, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to determine the prevalence and distribution of Blastocystis sp. in different classes of hosts in Brazil. METHODS: Studies that analyzed hosts of various classes, including humans, domestic animals, wild animals or captive animals, were considered. The pooled prevalence of Blastocystis sp. infection was estimated by random effects models. RESULTS: For humans, similar prevalence rates were found for males (31.0\%, 95\% CI: 17.0-45.0\%; weight 10\%) and females (28.0\%, 95\% CI: 16.0-41.0\%; weight 10\%); the state of Mato Grosso do Sul showed the highest prevalence, with 41.0\% positivity (95\% CI: 36.0-46.0\%; weight 2.9\%). The prevalence among immunocompromised patients was 5.0\% (95\% CI: 3.0-7.0\%; weight 10\%), and the most common cause of immunosuppression was hemodialysis, with 23.0\% (95\% CI: 17.0-29.0\%; weight 12.4\%). Among classifications according to interaction with humans, wild and domestic animals presented values of 19.0\% (95\% CI: 7.0-31.0\%; weight 42.6\%) and 17.0\% (95\% CI: 13.0-21.0\%; weight 29.6\%), respectively. Among these animals, mammals (39.0\%, 95\% CI: 21.0-56.0\%; weight 47.3\%) and birds (18.0\%, 95\% CI: 10.0-27.0\%; weight 39.3\%) exhibited the highest prevalence. Phylogenetic analysis of Blastocystis sp. revealed greater genetic diversity for clades of subtypes (STs) ST1, ST2 and ST3. CONCLUSIONS: The overall prevalence of Blastocystis sp. in the Brazilian human population was 24\%, which reflects the reality in the South, Southeast and Midwest regions, where prevalence rates of up to 40\% were found. Among animals, mammals and birds exhibited the highest prevalence.},

  abstract	= {Selenium is an essential trace element for pig growth; generally, inorganic or organic selenium is used for dietary selenium supplementation. Newborn piglets obtain all nutrients from the sow; thus, the sow absorption rate of different selenium sources significantly affects sow reproductive performance and piglet development. Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed to provide insights into whether organic selenium is better than mineral selenium for improving sow reproductive performance and piglet development. The present study investigated the effects of different selenium sources in sow feed using articles published between June 1, 1980, and December 31, 2020, from four databases. In the meta-analysis, 19 articles (347 sows) from seven countries were included. It was shown that feeding organic selenium to sows during pregnancy significantly increased newborn piglet weight (P {\textless} 0.05), piglet weight at weaning (P {\textless} 0.05), litter weight at weaning (P {\textless} 0.01), selenium content in sow colostrum (P {\textless} 0.01), milk (P {\textless} 0.01) and serum (P {\textless} 0.01); and selenium content (P {\textless} 0.01) and glutathione peroxidase activity (P {\textless} 0.05) in piglet serum. However, it had no effect on the number of live-born piglets and litter weight at birth. Owing to study heterogeneity (I$^{\textrm{2}}$ {\textgreater} 50\%), we hypothesized that the sow breed or weaning age were the influencing factors. Publication bias and sensitivity analyses indicate that the present results are robust. Further research is needed to better understand how different selenium sources affect sow reproduction and piglet development.},

The co-occurrence network of co-cited literatures and important keywords in this field also were drawn. By the literatures with high citation frequency and the keywords with high frequency, the overall research situation and hotspots were showed, and the development context and trend were interpreted in this field. Furthermore, based on 52 Chinese scientific papers in this field from CNKI database, the research progress on genetic mechanism of heat stress in dairy cattle in China was summarized. By the co-occurrence of keywords and co-citation analysis of literatures at home and abroad, it was found that heat shock proteins, single nucleotide polymorphisms, oxidative stress and reproductive performance were research hotspots in this field. With the deepening of research in this field, it has gradually developed from the expression analysis of genes to identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms related to heat-resistance and exploring the regulation mechanisms of genes related to heat stress in dairy cattle. In the expression regulation of genes related to heat stress, epigenetics and miRNA played important roles. In the genetic mechanisms research for heat stress in dairy cattle, this paper could be beneficial for understanding research situation and knowledge structure in this field, and help quickly finding the primary focus and key literature.},

  abstract	= {Ticks and tick-borne diseases (TTBD) are constraints to the development of livestock and induce potential human health problems. The worldwide distribution of ticks is not homogenous. Some places are ecologically suitable for ticks but they are not introduced in these areas yet. The absence or low density of hosts is a factor affecting the dissemination of the parasite. To understand the process of introduction and spread of TTBD in different areas, and forecast their presence, scientists developed different models (e.g., predictive models and explicative models). This study aimed to identify models developed by researchers to analyze the TTBD distribution and to assess the performance of these various models with a meta-analysis. A literature search was implemented with PRISMA protocol in two online databases (Scopus and PubMed). The selected articles were classified according to country, type of models and the objective of the modeling. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy available data of these models were used to evaluate their performance using a meta-analysis. One hundred studies were identified in which seven tick genera were modeled, with Ixodes the most frequently modeled. Additionally, 13 genera of tick-borne pathogens were also modeled, with Borrelia the most frequently modeled. Twenty-three different models were identified and the most frequently used are the generalized linear model representing 26.67\% and the maximum entropy model representing 24.17\%. A focus on TTBD modeling in Africa showed that, respectively, genus Rhipicephalus and Theileria parva were the most modeled. A meta-analysis on the quality of 20 models revealed that maximum entropy, linear discriminant analysis, and the ecological niche factor analysis models had, respectively, the highest sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve effect size among all the selected models. Modeling TTBD is highly relevant for predicting their distribution and preventing their adverse effect on animal and human health and the economy. Related results of such analyses are useful to build prevention and/or control programs by veterinary and public health authorities.},

  abstract	= {AIMS: This meta-analysis aims to assess the point prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated from bovine mastitis cases at the global level. METHODS AND RESULTS: Several electronic databases were searched for relevant publications (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge and Cochrane Library). Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the Cochrane Q test and I(2) test statistics based on the random-effect model. The potential sources of between-study heterogeneity were evaluated using subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Sensitivity and publication bias analyses were performed. Sixty-six studies with a total of 77,644 mastitis cases were eligible and included in the analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of MRSA was 4·30\% (95\% CI: 3·24-5·50) with a significant heterogeneity (I(2)  = 97·48\%, p {\textless} 0·001). In the subgroup analysis by region, the highest prevalence was found in Asia (6·47\%, 95\% CI: 4·33-8·97), and the lowest prevalence was reported in Europe (1·18\%, 95\% CI: 0·18-2·83). The pooled prevalence was significantly higher in clinical mastitis and cases published during 2016-2020. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that there is a lower prevalence of MRSA in bovine mastitis. However, its prevalence increased in the past 4 years. Therefore, continuous surveillance is urgently required for monitoring the dissemination of these clinically important bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to estimate the global prevalence of MRSA isolated from bovine mastitis cases.},

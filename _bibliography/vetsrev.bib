  abstract	= {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Depressive symptoms are highly prevalent in older adults and may contribute to functional impairment at old age. Animal-assisted interventions (AAIs), including interventions involving dog visiting, are increasingly recognized as an innovative approach to ameliorate social, behavioral, psychological, and physical outcomes among older adults. However, available data on their potential to manage depressive symptoms in the aging population are not clear cut. The aim of this review was to conduct a meta-analysis of all prospective controlled studies evaluating the effects of dog visiting on depressive symptoms in older adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted on the electronic databases PubMed and Scopus. Included articles were published between 1980 and 2017 and report controlled empirical studies of dog visiting interventions to ameliorate depressive symptoms in older adults. RESULTS: There was substantial heterogeneity between included studies, which varied in their methodological quality, sample size, and other key features. Notwithstanding such methodological variety, results all go in the same direction and indicate a large beneficial effect of interventions involving dog visiting on depressive symptoms. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This analysis confirms the potential value of dog visiting in ameliorating depressive symptoms in institutionalized and noninstitutionalized older adults. This is in line with previous research indicating AAIs as promising complementary programs for preserving/enhancing emotional and behavioral function in aged individuals. More research is still needed to allow AAIs to be effectively introduced in clinical practice.},

  abstract	= {OBJECTIVE: Several different animal models are used to study disuse-induced bone loss. This systematic review aims to give a comprehensive overview of the animal models of disuse-induced bone loss and provide a detailed narrative synthesis of each unique animal model. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were systematically searched for animal models of disuse from inception to November 30, 2019. In addition, Google Scholar and personal file archives were searched for relevant publications not indexed in PubMed or Embase. Two reviewers independently reviewed titles and abstracts for full-text inclusion. Data were extracted using a predefined extraction scheme to ensure standardization. RESULTS: 1964 titles and abstracts were screened of which 653 full-text articles were included. The most common animal species used to model disuse were rats (59\%) and mice (30\%). Males (53\%) where used in the majority of the studies and genetically modified animals accounted for 7\%. Twelve different methods to induce disuse were identified. The most frequently used methods were hindlimb unloading (44\%), neurectomy (15\%), bandages and orthoses (15\%), and botulinum toxin (9\%). The median time of disuse was 21 days (quartiles: 14 days, 36 days) and the median number of animals per group subjected to disuse was 10 (quartiles: 7, 14). Random group allocation was reported in 43\% of the studies. Fewer than 5\% of the studies justified the number of animals per group by a sample size calculation to ensure adequate statistical power. CONCLUSION: Multiple animal models of disuse-induced bone loss exist, and several species of animals have successfully been studied. The complexity of disuse-induced bone loss warrants rigid research study designs. This systematic review emphasized the need for standardization of animal disuse research and reporting.},

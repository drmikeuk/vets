	abstract = {Despite the poor prognosis associated with myelomeningocele (MMC), the options for prenatal treatments are still limited. Recently, fetal cellular therapy has become a  new option for treating birth defects, although the therapeutic effects and  mechanisms associated with such treatments remain unclear. The use of human amniotic  fluid stem cells (hAFSCs) is ideal with respect to immunoreactivity and cell  propagation. The prenatal diagnosis of MMC during early stages of pregnancy could  allow for the ex vivo proliferation and modulation of autologous hAFSCs for use in  utero stem cell therapy. Therefore, we investigated the therapeutic effects and  mechanisms of hAFSCs-based treatment for fetal MMC. hAFSCs were isolated as  CD117-positive cells from the amniotic fluid of 15- to 17-week pregnant women who  underwent amniocentesis for prenatal diagnosis and consented to this study. Rat dams  were exposed to retinoic acid to induce fetal MMC and were subsequently injected  with hAFSCs in each amniotic cavity. We measured the exposed area of the spinal cord  and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) levels at the lesion. The exposed spinal area of  the hAFSC-treated group was significantly smaller than that of the control group.  Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a reduction in neuronal damage such as  neurodegeneration and astrogliosis in the hAFSC-treated group. Additionally, in  lesions of the hAFSC-treated group, HGF expression was upregulated and HGF-positive  hAFSCs were identified, suggesting that these cells migrated to the lesion and  secreted HGF to suppress neuronal damage and induce neurogenesis. Therefore, in  utero hAFSC therapy could become a novel strategy for fetal MMC. Stem Cells  Translational Medicine 2019;8:1170-1179.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Statins as inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase have been recently recognized as anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective drugs. In this paper, we studied  anti-apoptotic and regulatory effects of lovastatin using Pilocarpine rat model  through downregulation of Mst1 (Mammalian sterile 20-like kinase 1) as a novel  pro-apoptotic gene. METHODS: The rats were divided into four groups: non-treated  epileptic rats, lovastatin treated, and two vehicle groups. Racine scale was used  for behavioral assessment and animals with a score of 4-5 were selected for the  study. After 3 days, epileptic rats received intraperitoneal injections of  lovastatin, followed by treating for 14 days. Next, they were sacrificed (28  post-first seizure) and prepared for histopathological analysis and Real-time  RT-PCR. RESULTS: The results showed that lovastatin protects Pilocarpine-induced  cell death via a regulatory effect on pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic gene  expression. The real-time PCR results showed that in the epileptic lovastatin  treated group, the expression level of Mst1 significantly decreased  while Nrf2 and Bcl-2 genes increased. Furthermore, histological analysis of  neurodegeneration in the brain sections showed that the number of hippocampal  apoptotic cells significantly decreased in the treatment groups. The results showed  that the numerical density of neurons per area was significantly higher in the  treated than the untreated group. CONCLUSION: Overall, the results of this study  showed that lovastatin attenuates hippocampal cell death in Pilocarpine-induced  status epilepticus rat model through downregulation of the pro-apoptotic Mst1 gene.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIM: Evaluation of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C patients (CHC) provides a high value, not only for the diagnosis of the disease, but also for the  therapeutic decision. The aim of the current study is the construction of simple  non-invasive and more accurate score for liver fibrosis staging in CHC patients and  estimating its performance against three published non-invasive indexes. MATERIAL  AND METHODS: CHC patients were divided into two groups: an estimated group (n = 75)  and validated group (n = 50). Liver fibrosis was tested in biopsies by Metavair  score system. Fas/CD95, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and endostatin were assayed  by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Statistical analysis was performed by  stepwise linear discriminate analysis and area under-receiver operating curves  (AUCs). RESULTS: The multivariate discriminate analysis (MDA) selects a function  based on absolute values of five biochemical markers; FHEPA (Fas/CD95, HGF,  Endostatin, Platelets\&Albumin)-Test score = 1.2 × Fas/CD95 (ng/mL) + 0.006 × HGF  (pg/mL) + 0.03 × Endostatin (ng/mL) - 0.007 × platelets count(10(9)/L)-3.6 × Albumin  (g/dL) - 8.6.FHEPA-Test producesAUCs 0.99, 0.877 and 0.847 to discriminate patients  with significant fibrosis (F2-F4), advanced fibrosis (F3-F4) and cirrhosis (F4),  respectively. CONCLUSION: FHEPA-Test is considered a novel non-invasive test which  could be applied in assessment of liver fibrosis in HCV infected patients. Our novel  score was more efficient than Immune Fibrosis Index, Fibrosis Index and FibroQ and  thus it could be more applicable, feasible \& economic for Egyptian HCV patients. Our  Novel Scoring system could be globalized to other populations to confirm its  advantageous use in early diagnosis of liver fibrosis.},

	abstract = {An understanding of the molecular basis of liver regeneration will open new horizons for the development of novel therapies for chronic liver failure. Such therapies  would solve the drawbacks associated with liver transplant, including the shortage  of donor organs, long waitlist time, high medical costs, and lifelong use of  immunosuppressive agents. Regeneration after partial hepatectomy has been studied in  animal models, particularly fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase-deficient (FAH (-/-)) mice  and pigs. The process of regeneration is distinctive, complex, and well coordinated,  and it depends on the interplay among several signaling pathways (eg, nuclear factor  κβ, Notch, Hippo), cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin 6), and  growth factors (eg, hepatocyte growth factor, epidermal growth factor, vascular  endothelial growth factor), and other components. Furthermore, endocrinal hormones  (eg, norepinephrine, growth hormone, insulin, thyroid hormones) also can influence  the aforementioned pathways and factors. We believe that these endocrinal hormones  are important hepatic mitogens that strongly induce and accelerate hepatocyte  proliferation (regeneration) by directly and indirectly triggering the activity of  the involved signaling pathways, cytokines, growth factors, and transcription  factors. The subsequent induction of cyclins and associated cyclin-dependent kinase  complexes allow hepatocytes to enter the cell cycle. In this review article, we  comprehensively summarize the current knowledge regarding the roles and mechanisms  of these hormones in liver regeneration. Articles used for this review were  identified by searching MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception through June 1,  2019.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The skeletal musculature of gnathostomes, which is derived from embryonic somites, consists of epaxial and hypaxial portions. Some hypaxial muscles,  such as tongue and limb muscles, undergo de-epithelialization and migration during  development. Delamination and migration of these myoblasts, or migratory muscle  precursors (MMPs), is generally thought to be regulated by hepatocyte growth factor  (HGF) and receptor tyrosine kinase (MET) signaling. However, the prevalence of this  mechanism and the expression patterns of the genes involved in MMP development  across different vertebrate species remain elusive. RESULTS: We performed a  comparative analysis of Hgf and Met gene expression in several vertebrates,  including mouse, chicken, dogfish (Scyliorhinus torazame), and lamprey (Lethenteron  camtschaticum). While both Hgf and Met were expressed during development in the  mouse tongue muscle, and in limb muscle formation in the mouse and chicken, we found  no clear evidence for the involvement of HGF/MET signaling in MMP development in  shark or lamprey embryos. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the expressions and  functions of both Hgf and Met genes do not represent shared features of vertebrate  MMPs, suggesting a stepwise participation of HGF/MET signaling in MMP development  during vertebrate evolution.},

Proteins that govern the inflammatory response are secreted into the extracellular space, but this  compartment still needs to be characterized in human breast tissues in vivo.

Here, we used the minimal  invasive technique of microdialysis for sampling of extracellular proteins in live  tissues in situ in breast cancers of women before surgery and in healthy women  having dense or non-dense breast tissue on mammography. Proteins were profiled using  a proximity extension assay. Out of the 32 proteins assessed, 26 exhibited similar  profiles in breast cancers and dense breast tissues; CCL-4, -7, -8, -11, -15, -16,  -22, -23, and -25, CXCL-5, -8, -9, -16 as well as sIL-6R, IL-18, vascular  endothelial growth factor, TGF-α, fibroblast growth factor 19, matrix  metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, -2, -3, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator were all  increased, whereas CCL-3, CX3CL1, hepatocyte growth factor, and MMP-9 were unaltered  in the two tissues. CCL-19 and -24, CXCL-1 and -10, and IL-6 were increased in dense  breast tissue only, whereas IL-18BP was increased in breast cancer only. Our results  provide novel insights in the inflammatory microenvironment in human breast cancer  in situ and define potential novel therapeutic targets. Additionally, we show  previously unrecognized similarities of the pro-inflammatory microenvironment in  dense breast tissue and breast cancer in vivo suggesting that anti-inflammatory  breast cancer prevention trials for women with dense breast tissue may be feasible.},

	abstract = {Even in the context of modern medicine, infants with fetal and neonatal neurological diseases such as cerebral palsy and myelomeningocele suffer serious long-lasting  impairment due to the irreversible neuronal damage. The promotion of neurologically  intact survival in patients with perinatal intractable neurological diseases  requires the development of novel strategies. One promising strategy involves the  use of human amniotic fluid stem cells (hAFSCs), which have attracted much attention  in recent years and are known to exert anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective  effects. In recent years, the therapeutic effects of hAFSCs on fetal-neonatal  neurological diseases have become evident as per intense research efforts by our  group and others. Specifically, hAFSCs administered into the nasal cavity migrated  to the brain and controlled local inflammation in a rodent model of neonatal  hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. In contrast, hAFSCs administered intraperitoneally  did not migrate to the brain; they rather formed spheroids in the abdominal cavity,  resulting in the suppression of systemic inflammation (including in the brain) via  the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines in concert with peritoneal macrophages  in a rodent model of periventricular leukomalacia. Moreover, studies in a rat model  of myelomeningocele suggested that hAFSCs administered in utero secreted hepatocyte  growth factor and protected the exposed spinal cord during pregnancy. Importantly,  autologous hAFSCs, whose use for fetal-neonatal treatment does not raise ethical  issues, can be collected during pregnancy and prepared in sufficient numbers for  therapeutic use. This article outlines the results of preclinical research on fetal  stem cell therapy, mainly involving hAFSCs, in the context of perinatal neurological  diseases.},

Serum levels of  eight proangiogenic cytokines and the appearance of adverse events were monitored  periodically, and their correlations with the prognoses of the patients were  evaluated. RESULTS: Among six significant risk factors for overall survival in  univariate analyses, high angiopoietin-2 (hazard ratio, 2.06), high hepatocyte  growth factor (hazard ratio, 2.08), and poor performance status before the treatment  (hazard ratio, 2.48) were determined as independent risk factors. In addition, high  angiopoietin-2 at the time of progressive disease was a marker of short  post-progression survival (hazard ratio, 4.27). However, there was no significant  variable that predicted short progression-free survival except the presence of  hepatitis B virus surface antigen.

Although there is a big donor scarcity, many donor livers are  discarded as they do not qualify for transplantation. Alternatively,  decellularization of discarded livers can potentially render them transplantable  upon recellularization and functional testing. The success of this approach will  heavily depend on the quality of decellularized scaffolds which might show  variability due to factors including age. Here we assessed the age-dependent  differences in liver extracellular matrix (ECM) using rat and human livers. We show  that the liver matrix has higher collagen and glycosaminoglycan content and a lower  growth factor content with age. Importantly, these changes lead to deterioration in  primary hepatocyte function potentially due to ECM stiffening and integrin-dependent  signal transduction. Overall, we show that ECM changes with age and these changes  significantly affect cell function thus donor age should be considered as an  important factor for bioengineering liver substitutes.},

	abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Inflammatory signals and increased prostaglandin synthesis play a role during the development of diabetes. The prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) receptor,  GPR44/DP2, is highly expressed in human islets and activation of the pathway results  in impaired insulin secretion. The role of GPR44 activation on islet function and  survival rate during chronic hyperglycaemic conditions is not known. In this study,  we investigate GPR44 inhibition by using a selective GPR44 antagonist (AZ8154) in  human islets both in vitro and in vivo in diabetic mice transplanted with human  islets. METHODS: Human islets were exposed to PGD(2) or proinflammatory cytokines in  vitro to investigate the effect of GPR44 inhibition on islet survival rate. In  addition, the molecular mechanisms of GPR44 inhibition were investigated in human  islets exposed to high concentrations of glucose (HG) and to IL-1β. For the in vivo  part of the study, human islets were transplanted under the kidney capsule of  immunodeficient diabetic mice and treated with 6, 60 or 100 mg/kg per day of a GPR44  antagonist starting from the transplantation day until day 4 (short-term study) or  day 17 (long-term study) post transplantation. IVGTT was performed on mice at day 10  and day 15 post transplantation. After termination of the study, metabolic  variables, circulating human proinflammatory cytokines, and hepatocyte growth factor  (HGF) were analysed in the grafted human islets. RESULTS: PGD(2) or proinflammatory  cytokines induced apoptosis in human islets whereas GPR44 inhibition reversed this  effect. GPR44 inhibition antagonised the reduction in glucose-stimulated insulin  secretion induced by HG and IL-1β in human islets. This was accompanied by  activation of the Akt-glycogen synthase kinase 3β signalling pathway together with  phosphorylation and inactivation of forkhead box O-1and upregulation of pancreatic  and duodenal homeobox-1 and HGF. Administration of the GPR44 antagonist for up to  17 days to diabetic mice transplanted with a marginal number of human islets  resulted in reduced fasting blood glucose and lower glucose excursions during IVGTT.  Improved glucose regulation was supported by increased human C-peptide levels  compared with the vehicle group at day 4 and throughout the treatment period. GPR44  inhibition reduced plasma levels of TNF-α and growth-regulated oncogene-α/chemokine  (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 and increased the levels of HGF in human islets.  CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Inhibition of GPR44 in human islets has the potential to  improve islet function and survival rate under inflammatory and hyperglycaemic  stress. This may have implications for better survival rate of islets following  transplantation.},

	abstract = {In type 2 diabetes (T2D), hepatic insulin resistance is strongly associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this study, we hypothesized that the  DNA methylome of livers from patients with T2D compared with livers of individuals  with normal plasma glucose levels can unveil some mechanism of hepatic insulin  resistance that could link to NAFLD. Using DNA methylome and transcriptome analyses  of livers from obese individuals, we found that hypomethylation at a CpG site in  PDGFA (encoding platelet-derived growth factor α) and PDGFA overexpression are both  associated with increased T2D risk, hyperinsulinemia, increased insulin resistance,  and increased steatohepatitis risk. Genetic risk score studies and human cell  modeling pointed to a causative effect of high insulin levels on PDGFA CpG site  hypomethylation, PDGFA overexpression, and increased PDGF-AA secretion from the  liver. We found that PDGF-AA secretion further stimulates its own expression through  protein kinase C activity and contributes to insulin resistance through decreased  expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 and of insulin receptor. Importantly,  hepatocyte insulin sensitivity can be restored by PDGF-AA-blocking antibodies, PDGF  receptor inhibitors, and by metformin, opening therapeutic avenues. Therefore, in  the liver of obese patients with T2D, the increased PDGF-AA signaling contributes to  insulin resistance, opening new therapeutic avenues against T2D and possibly NAFLD.},

	abstract = {Identifying signals in the tumor microenvironment (TME) that shape CD8(+) T cell phenotype can inform novel therapeutic approaches for cancer. Here, we identified a  gradient of increasing glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression and signaling from  naïve to dysfunctional CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Conditional  deletion of the GR in CD8(+) TILs improved effector differentiation, reduced  expression of the transcription factor TCF-1, and inhibited the dysfunctional  phenotype, culminating in tumor growth inhibition. GR signaling transactivated the  expression of multiple checkpoint receptors and promoted the induction of  dysfunction-associated genes upon T cell activation. In the TME, monocyte-macrophage  lineage cells produced glucocorticoids and genetic ablation of steroidogenesis in  these cells as well as localized pharmacologic inhibition of glucocorticoid  biosynthesis improved tumor growth control. Active glucocorticoid signaling  associated with failure to respond to checkpoint blockade in both preclinical models  and melanoma patients. Thus, endogenous steroid hormone signaling in CD8(+) TILs  promotes dysfunction, with important implications for cancer immunotherapy.},

	abstract = {CD98, which is required for the rapid proliferation of both normal and cancer cells, and MET, the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, are potential targets for  therapeutic antitumor Abs. In this study, we report that the antiproliferative  activity of a prototype anti-CD98 Ab, UM7F8, is due to Ab-induced  membrane-associated ring CH (MARCH) E3 ubiquitin ligase-mediated ubiquitination and  downregulation of cell surface CD98. MARCH1-mediated ubiquitination of CD98 is  required for UM7F8's capacity to reduce CD98 surface expression and its capacity to  inhibit the proliferation of murine T cells. Similarly, CD98 ubiquitination is  required for UM7F8's capacity to block the colony-forming ability of murine  leukemia-initiating cells. To test the potential generality of the paradigm that  MARCH E3 ligases can mediate the antiproliferative response to antitumor Abs, we  examined the potential effects of MARCH proteins on responses to emibetuzumab, an  anti-MET Ab currently in clinical trials for various cancers. We report that MET  surface expression is reduced by MARCH1, 4, or 8-mediated ubiquitination and that  emibetuzumab-induced MET ubiquitination contributes to its capacity to downregulate  MET and inhibit human tumor cell proliferation. Thus, MARCH E3 ligases can act as  cofactors for antitumor Abs that target cell surface proteins, suggesting that the  MARCH protein repertoire of cells is a determinant of their response to such Abs.},

	abstract = {Liver diseases are serious life-threating conditions that should be controlled. Here, we identify a protein fraction from royal-jelly (RJ) that represents the most  effective composite against CCl(4)-induced hepatotoxicity and HepG2 cell growth. Two  closely related proteins were purified from this fraction by a new simple method and  identified by MALDI-TOF MS as major RJ protein 2 (MRJP2) and its predicted isoform  X1. The in silico assessment (3D structures and functions) of these proteins were  performed using Iterative Threading ASSEmbly Refinement (I-TASSER) analysis and  RAMPAGE program. These two purified proteins were able to relieve the necrotic  hepatocytes (by 60.4\%) via reducing tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, mixed lineage  kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) and intracellular reactive species. The latter  effects associated with improving hepatocyte functions. Furthermore, they revealed  the potent anticancer effect via induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis and  controlling the expression of both Bcl-2 and p53 in HepG2 cells. Thus, MRJP2 and its  isoform X1 can be a promising dual strategy for fighting hepatic injury and cancer  in future animal and human studies.},

  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>This report aims to present data and expert knowledge on poverty and zoonoses hotspots to inform prioritization of study areas on the transmission of disease in emerging livestock systems in the developing world, where prevention of zoonotic disease might bring greatest benefit to poor people. The first chapter reviews the substantial literature on prioritizing disease and identifies prioritization criteria relevant to this study, namely: burden of human disease; impacts on livestock production and productivity; amenability to agricultural intervention; and, concern because of emergence or severity. This allowed the identification of 24 zoonoses of high importance to poor people, 13 of which were investigated in depth. The next chapter reviews current evidence on poverty and livestock, on livestock systems and their dynamics, and on zoonoses and how they are currently mapped. The map of poor livestock keepers is updated and an additional map based on subnational data is presented. Maps of livestock systems that are changing most rapidly in response to emerging markets are also presented, and vulnerability to climate change is described. The strengths and weaknesses of different maps are noted. The next chapter presents evidence from a systematic review of over 1000 studies on the prevalence of the 13 priority zoonoses in people and animals. It focuses on the endemic zoonoses that impose greatest burden and a ’top 20’ list is given of geographical hotspots. Data on zoonoses are also extracted from the WHO Global Burden of Disease and the ’top 20’ countries identified. A case study that compares our systematic review with an ’in-country review’ focusing on grey literature and literature in a language other than English is included. Some of the challenges of the study and caution in interpreting the results are discussed. The next chapter updates the map of emerging disease events. For the first time, emerging zoonoses are mapped as distinct from other emerging disease events. The last chapter provides maps of regional agroecosystems and summarizes numbers of livestock, people and poor livestock keepers by system as well as the zoonoses context. It also draws some global conclusions from the study.</p>

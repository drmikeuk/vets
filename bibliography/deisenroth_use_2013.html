  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Gold bead implantation/gold acupuncture is becoming increasingly used in veterinary medicine as a method of pain treatment in cases of osteoarthritic diseases. Part one of the overview dealing with the use of gold implants as a treatment of canine hip joint dysplasia (cHD) introduced the method of implanting gold in tissue and publications which investigated the subsequent effects of implantation. This article focuses on publications concerning the clinical effectiveness of gold implantation within the scope of pain therapy in cHD. Due to the study design, a classification using evidence-based levels (EbL) was carried out. Three double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised studies (EbL II) were considered together with three retrospective studies on own patients (EbL IV) and five case studies (EbL IV). While the case and retrospective studies reported impressive therapeutic success in treating cHD-incurred pain with gold implantation, a pain-reducing effect through gold implantation was only demonstrated in one of the three double-blind studies. The two remaining EbL II studies found no differences between the placebo-group and the group of dogs treated with gold implantation. In one of these two studies, kinematic and kinetic gait analyses were used for objective evaluation of the effects of the treatment. Thus, the only study that carried out an objective evaluation of the therapeutic result of gold implantation came to the conclusion that the method is ineffective. For a concluding assessment of gold implantation in the case of cHD, gait analysis studies investigating the effects of gold implantation in comparison to a standard treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are currently lacking.</p>

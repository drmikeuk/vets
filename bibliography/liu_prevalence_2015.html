  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is becoming a serious epidemic worldwide. Recently, studies have shown that people in contact with livestock may have a greater chance of MRSA carriage. We aimed to establish the prevalence of MRSA among people in contact with livestock and review the factors influencing MRSA carriage. METHODS: We systematically examined published epidemiologic studies on MRSA prevalence in people in contact with livestock using Pubmed, Medline, Embase, Ovid, and the Cochrane Library. Prevalence estimates were pooled using a random-effects model. Study heterogeneity was assessed using Q statistics and quantified with I2 statistics. RESULTS: Thirty-three eligible studies were included in this systematic review. Prevalence of MRSA ranged from 0.0%-85.8%. The pooled prevalence estimate of MRSA was 14.2% (95% confidence interval, 9.1%-20.1%) for people in contact with livestock. Substantial heterogeneity in eligible studies was noted (chi2 = 1,025; P \textless .001; I2 = 96.9%). Subgroup analysis showed the prevalence of MRSA was high in people from Europe (15.9%), farmers (18.2%), and by longitudinal study design (38.9%). Animal contact and intensity of animal contact were associated with increased risk of MRSA carriage. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that there may be transmission of MRSA between animals and humans.</p>

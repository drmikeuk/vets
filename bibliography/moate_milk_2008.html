  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Previously observed relationships between dietary composition and production of a small number of individual milk fatty acids were the motivation to examine whether equations could be developed to predict production of all the major individual milk fatty acids. Such equations could be incorporated into ration formulation programs and used to examine factors that influence milk fat composition. Data from 29 published experiments on Holstein cows that provided 120 dietary treatments were entered into CPM-Dairy to obtain estimates of amounts of individual long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) absorbed from the intestines. These derived data and other dietary and animal data including the reported fatty acid composition of milk fat were entered into a spreadsheet. Descriptors of diet included daily intake of dry matter, total fermentable carbohydrate, total fatty acids, and profile of dietary fatty acids, intake of neutral detergent fiber, supplemental fish-oil, buffer, and magnesium oxide. Cow data included body weight and days in milk (DIM). Multiple linear regression was used to develop equations to predict the production (g/d) of each of 26 major LCFA. The equations developed generally had R(2) values in excess of 0.5. Production (g/d) of total de novo fatty acids (C4:0 to C15:0) (PTdenovo) was found to be positively related to the intake of fermentable carbohydrate, and negatively related to the intake of fish oil fatty acids and the estimated total amount of unsaturated fatty acids absorbed from the intestines. The PTdenovo was greater in pasture-fed cows than total mixed ration-fed cows and was negatively related to the square root of DIM. Production of each individual de novo fatty acid was described by a fixed proportion of PTdenovo. These proportions were 0.12 +/- 0.006 (C4:0), 0.083 +/- 0.0039 (C6:0), 0.0516 +/- 0.0025 (C8:0), 0.111 +/- 0.003 (C10:0), 0.134 +/- 0.0037 (C12:0), 0.441 +/- 0.007 (C14:0), 0.046 +/- 0.0024 (C14:1), and 0.0432 +/- 0.0017 (C15:0). Separate independent equations were developed to describe the daily production of C16:0, C16:1, and the main individual preformed fatty acids (\textgreaterC16). The productions of each of the main individual pre-formed fatty acids were generally strongly related to the corresponding estimated amount (g/d) of specific fatty acids absorbed from the intestines. Percentage estimates for the direct transfer of the major absorbed LCFA to their corresponding LCFA in milk were 42% (C16:0); 9.5% (C18:0); 47.5% (cis-9 C18:1); 16.1% (all isomers of trans-C18:1), 38% (cis-9, cis-12 C18:2); and 31% (cis-9, cis-12, cis15 C18:3). High dietary intake of fish oil fatty acids was negatively associated with the production of all of the major individual preformed fatty acids with the exception of C20:5 and C22:6. In some instances, particular dietary factors were found to have positive influences on production of one fatty acid and negative influences on another. For example, high levels of dietary magnesium oxide were positively associated with production of C17 fatty acids but negatively associated with production of C18:0 and cis-9, trans-11 C18:2 (conjugated linoleic acid). This analysis quantified effects of major dietary and cow factors on production of individual fatty acids in milk.</p>

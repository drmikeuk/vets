  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>A systematic literature review was performed to summarize the nature, implementation, outcomes, and long-term impacts of previously instituted interventions and programs aimed at educating veterinary public health providers. A logic model was developed to direct the literature search strategy, provide a framework for evaluating the relationship between veterinary public health professional education and their associated population health outcomes, and guide future training development and recommendations for the education of veterinary health professionals. Our literature review indicates that there is a relative lack of published literature that connects veterinary public health educational interventions to population health outcomes. Reasons for the lack of evidence to connect educational programs and population health outcomes include the evaluation of outcomes on a short-term rather than intermediate- or long-term basis, a lack of experimental studies, and infrequent grounding in population health or educational theory. Future intervention recommendations as suggested in the reviewed articles are also summarized.</p>

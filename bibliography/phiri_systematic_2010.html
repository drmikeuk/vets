  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>This article presents the first systematic review of the causes and factors associated with morbidity and mortality, on smallholder dairy farms in Eastern and Southern Africa. It was conducted in August 2007. Primary studies on causes of morbidity and mortality on smallholder dairy farms in the region were identified, examined and descriptive information extracted. Electronic (CAB Abstracts, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Web of Science) and non-electronic databases were used to identify and retrieve the primary studies. The retrieval process included all types of study designs with no restriction on the year of publication and language. Mastitis, tick-borne diseases (TBDs), tick infestation and diarrhoea were among the most commonly documented causes of morbidity. TBDs, diarrhoea and trypanosomiasis were among the most commonly documented causes of mortality; however, a substantial number of mortalities with undiagnosed causes were also reported. Factors ranked as most negatively associated with mastitis were residual calf suckling and increased water availability on the farm while use of common udder towel was the factor most positively associated with mastitis. Zero-grazing was ranked as the factor most negatively associated with TBDs while age was most positively associated. More intervention studies are recommended in the region to better identify animal health constraints and their associated risk factors.</p>

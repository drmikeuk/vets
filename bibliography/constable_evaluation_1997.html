  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Systematic review of published cases and a hospital-based case-control study were completed to evaluate breed as a risk factor for atresia coli in cattle. Systematic review of 37 published studies indicated that atresia coli has been diagnosed in 10 cattle breeds and 12 countries, with the marked preponderance of cases occurring in Holstein-Friesian calves (485/514 cases, 94%). Epidemiologic analysis based on 28,373 cattle \textless 2 mo of age admitted to North American veterinary schools between 1964 and 1993 identified 291 cases of atresia coli in 13 breeds, with the marked preponderance of cases occurring in Holstein-Friesian calves (228/291, 78%). Holstein-Friesian cattle were at significantly greater risk for the condition than all other dairy cattle breeds (crude odds ratio 4.55, P \textless 0.0001) and all other cattle breeds (crude odds ratio 7.12, P \textless 0.0001), whereas there was no difference in the odds ratio between dairy cattle (not Holstein-Friesian) and beef cattle (crude odds ratio 1.68, P = 0.11). Atresia coli probably occurs secondary to vascular insufficiency of the developing colon. Holstein-Friesian cattle may be genetically predisposed to atresia coli, possibly because their developing colon grows at a faster rate and/or to a greater extent than that in other cattle breeds. Early or vigorous palpation per rectum of the amniotic vesicle appears to increase the risk of atresia coli in a genetically predisposed fetus, probably through palpation-induced damage to the developing colonic vasculature.</p>

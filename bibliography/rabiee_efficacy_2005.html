  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>The efficacy of the Ovsynch program in improving conception and pregnancy rates was compared with untreated controls and other synchrony programs in lactating dairy cows. This meta-analysis examined 71 treatment and control comparisons extracted from 53 research papers. Programs evaluated included Ovsynch, natural breeding, single, double, or triple prostaglandin injections, Select Synch, Heat Synch, and modified Ovsynch. Pregnancy rates for Ovsynch programs did not differ significantly from those with natural breeding programs [predicted Bayesian relative risk (RR) = 1.04, 95% Bayesian credible interval = 0.36 to 3.23]. Results of Ovsynch vs. PGF(2alpha) programs showed that the risk of conception (predicted Bayesian RR = 0.89, 95% Bayesian credible interval = 0.31 to 2.64), and pregnancy rates predicted Bayesian RR = 1.11, 95% Bayesian credible interval = 0.61 to 2.13) did not differ significantly between the Ovsynch group and cows in the PGF(2alpha) group. Comparisons between Ovsynch and Select Synch demonstrated that the risk of conception (predicted Bayesian RR = 0.94, 95% Bayesian credible interval = 0.52 to 1.59), and pregnancy rates (predicted Bayesian RR = 1.08, 95% Bayesian credible interval = 0.38 to 3.09) did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Examination of Ovsynch vs. modified Ovsynch programs showed that the risk of pregnancy in cows synchronized with modified Ovsynch was similar to those treated with Ovsynch (predicted Bayesian RR = 0.89, 95% Bayesian credible interval = 0.71 to 1.12).Meta-analyses identified that the conception and pregnancy rates obtained with the prostaglandin, Select Synch, and modified Ovsynch (including presynch and CoSynch) programs were comparable with the Ovsynch program. Modifications to the Ovsynch program such as presynchronization and timed artificial insemination at the time of second GnRH injection (CoSynch) may be an alternative for reproductive management of dairy herds where detection of estrus is less than optimal. The findings of this study demonstrate that the Ovsynch program could benefit dairy operations because it allows for timed artificial insemination of lactating cows without detection of estrus. There was, however, little or no significant improvement in pregnancy rates using Ovsynch over other programs and the costs of labor and hormone administration should be considered when selecting this form of reproductive technology for routine use.</p>

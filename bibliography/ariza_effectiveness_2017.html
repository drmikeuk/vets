  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>The collective treatment (CT) of an affected herd is commonly advised to control bovine digital dermatitis (DD). Several CT are commercialized, frequently without major evidence supporting their effectiveness. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the published evidence that supports CT in the treatment and prevention of DD lesions in dairy herds. Across the evidence, the main limitations in the studies design were identified and the possible sources of inconsistency were investigated. An extensive literature search of publications through electronic databases and gray literature was conducted between July 2015 and January 2016. Studies that did not include an untreated or placebo control group were excluded from the review. The literature search and screening process identified 13 publications with 24 treatment trial comparisons and 18 prevention trial comparisons. The published evidence included studies mostly considered to have a low or unclear risk of bias. Descriptive analyses were performed according to the prevention and treatment outcomes, and case and success definitions were identified for each study and summarized in odds ratios (OR). Pairwise meta-analyses were conducted according to the prevention and treatment outcomes, comparing directly the intervention used in each study, and ignoring any other differences in the intervention characteristics. The results of the meta-analyses indicated a low degree of heterogeneity across the evidence for the prevention outcome [I2 = 0%, 95% CI: 0 to 37.2%, 95% prediction interval (PI): 0.72 to 1.74)] and a moderate degree for the treatment outcome (I2 = 25.3%, 95% CI: 0 to 63%, 95% PI: 0.39 to 3.73). Similarly, appraisal of the graphical Lâ€™Abbe plot suggested a considerable degree of heterogeneity across the evidence for the treatment outcome. For both outcomes, the frequent small sample sizes of the trials indicate imprecision across the included studies. Additionally, for the treatment and prevention outcomes, an asymmetric funnel plot suggested possible publication bias. The overall quality of the evidence, for both outcomes (prevention and treatment), was therefore considered to be low, indicating that the true effect of CT may be substantially different from that estimated across the included studies. Consequently, this review and meta-analysis does not support an association between the CT considered in the review and a beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of DD lesions. The effectiveness of CT therefore remains uncertain, and the epidemiological circumstances in which it can be useful must be investigated. These findings highlight the importance of developing high quality, controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of CT for DD control.</p>

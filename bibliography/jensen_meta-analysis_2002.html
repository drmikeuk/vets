  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Our aims were to evaluate the published literature concerning the effect of swine vaccination against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae on the average daily weight gain (ADWG). This was done by re-evaluating the influence of selected factors on ADWG by a meta-analysis of published studies from 1991 to 1999, fulfilling certain inclusion criteria. With ADWG as the outcome, an analysis of variance was performed for such variables as treatment, vaccination schedule, age during study, housing system and publication quality. Each clinical trial was considered as a random effect and the numbers of pigs in each trial were weightings. Of 63 published studies, 16 describing three commercial vaccines fulfilled the criteria for the meta-analysis. Due to few studies with one of the vaccines (n=3), only two vaccines were included. Vaccinated pigs gained an average of 592g (S.E.=15) with Stellamune and 590g (S.E.=15) with Suvaxyne compared to non-vaccinated pigs that gained an average of 569g (S.E.=14)(P\textless0.01) when adjusted for age during the study. Vaccine type, vaccination schedule, housing system and publication quality were not significantly associated with ADWG.</p>

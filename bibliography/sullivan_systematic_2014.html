  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>REASONS FOR PERFORMING THE STUDY: Furosemide is the most commonly used medication for exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage (EIPH), however, critical evaluation of the strength of evidence for efficacy of furosemide is lacking and is warranted so that evidence based treatment decisions can be made. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of furosemide to reduce the severity or frequency of detection of EIPH in Thoroughbred racehorses. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analysis. METHODS: Primary studies were identified via searches of electronic databases, relevant texts and reference lists of published articles. Studies were not restricted by date or publication status. Only studies published in English were eligible for inclusion. Searches were performed using a predetermined search string. Randomised controlled trials and non randomised trials were included. Three authors independently assessed each study using the Cochrane collaboration guidelines and GRADE recommendations of rating quality of evidence. Meta-analysis of studies was performed with pooled data to determine if furosemide reduced the frequency of detection of EIPH (yes or no) as evaluated by tracheobronchoscopy or bronchoalveolar RBC number, or if furosemide reduced the severity of EIPH by at least one tracheobronchoscopic grade. RESULTS: Seventeen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The relative risk (RR) of detecting any EIPH by tracheobronchoscopy after administration of furosemide was 0.88 (pooled data from 11 studies, n = 5780; 95% CI 0.79 – 0.97, p = 0.01). When data from only high quality RCTs (2 studies, n = 405) were used, the RR of detecting endoscopically evident EIPH was 0.69 (95% CI 0.61 – 0.76, p\textless0.001). The proportion of horses previously diagnosed with EIPH having a reduction of at least one EIPH grade after furosemide was 0.68 (2 studies, n = 405; 95% CI 61 – 76%). CONCLUSIONS: There is high quality evidence, albeit limited, that administration of furosemide reduces the incidence and severity of EIPH in Thoroughbred or Standardbred racehorses.</p>

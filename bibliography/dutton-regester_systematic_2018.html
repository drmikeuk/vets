  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>Foot lesions causing lameness in dairy cows are important economic and welfare issues. Prompt and correct detection and diagnosis are critical for improving economic and welfare outcomes. Few tests are currently available to aid the dairy farmer in the detection and diagnosis of foot lesions. The objectives of this systematic review were to identify those tests that have been investigated for the detection and diagnosis of foot lesions causing lameness in dairy cows, evaluate the methodological quality of the studies investigating the identified tests, compare the accuracy of the identified test, and determine which tests can be recommended for implementation on the farm based on accuracy and practicality for use by dairy farmers. A comprehensive literature search resulted in 2137 papers. After removing duplicates and performing relevance screening, 12 papers with 20 studies met the inclusion criteria. Pertinent data from each study were extracted using a standardised form. Eligible studies were grouped based on the objective of the test under investigation, resulting in the following groups of disorders: lameness, foot lesions, sole ulcer, and digital dermatitis. Methodological quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool which includes four domains: animal selection, index test, reference test and flow and timing. Incomplete reporting in the studies limited the assessment of methodological quality. The animal selection domain was particularly poorly reported. No single study could be classified as being at low risk of bias across all domains of the QUADAS-2 tool. One automated test was identified, while all others were manually operated. No studies reported the cost of the test in question and only two studies reported the time taken to carry out the procedures involved with using the test in question. It was not possible to compare the accuracy of these tests or recommend which tests are suitable for implementation on the farm. This was due to incomplete reporting of information and significant risk of bias in all studies.</p>

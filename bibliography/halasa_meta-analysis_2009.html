  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>The main goal of dry cow therapy (DCT) is to cure existing intramammary infections (IMI) at dry off. Although several published studies have estimated the cure rate of IMI after DCT, variation among studies is great, which makes it difficult to conduct a proper economic evaluation of DCT. The objective of the present meta-analysis of existing peer-reviewed literature was to provide a summary quantification of quarter IMI cure based on DCT. A meta-analysis relative risk (RR) was calculated per intervention and pathogen group when at least 4 studies were available for analysis per comparison from the 22 selected studies, according to the selection criteria. Results of the meta-analysis were examined using publication bias tests. Blanket DCT with a 95% confidence interval (CI) provided a 1.78 (1.51 to 2.10) times higher calculated cure rate from quarter IMI during the dry period up to 21 d postcalving, compared with no DCT. The RR of cure was similar when treatment was conducted for Streptococcus spp. IMI quarters compared with Staphylococcus spp. IMI quarters. The pooled RR with the 95% CI were 1.83 (1.48 to 2.35) and 1.65 (1.38 to 1.96), respectively. There was no significant difference between cloxacillin and other DCT products in the cure of quarter IMI during the dry period up to 21 d postcalving. The pooled RR with the 95% CI was 1.00 (0.92 to 1.09). Similarly, there was no significant difference between cloxacillin and other DCT products in the cure of quarter Staphylococcus spp. IMI. The pooled RR with the 95% CI was 1.00 (0.96 to 1.06). The pooled RR with the 95% CI of quarter IMI cure using selective DCT, compared with no DCT, was 1.76 (1.23 to 2.54).</p>

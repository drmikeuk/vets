  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p>The minerals Cu, Mo, and S are essential for metabolic functions related to cattle health and performance. The interaction between Cu, Mo, and S can determine the utilization of each mineral, in particular Cu, by ruminants. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of dietary Cu, Mo, and S and their interactions on plasma and liver Cu, ADG, and G:F in growing-finishing cattle. Data were collated from 12 published studies. The model with the best fit to data indicated plasma Cu was positively affected by dietary Cu (P \textless 0.01) and negatively affected by both dietary Mo (P \textless 0.01) and S (P \textless 0.01). Another model also indicated that plasma Cu concentration is positively related to Cu:Mo ratio in the diet (P \textless 0.01). Dietary Cu had a positive effect on liver Cu (P \textless 0.01), whereas Mo showed a negative effect (P \textless 0.05), and no effect of dietary S on liver Cu was observed (P \textgreater 0.05). Average daily gain was negatively affected by dietary Mo (P \textless 0.05) and S (P \textless 0.01) and positively affected by Cu:Mo ratio (P \textless 0.01), likely because an increased Cu:Mo ratio minimizes the antagonistic effect of Mo on Cu. The feed conversion ratio was negatively affected by Mo (P \textless 0.05) and S (P \textless 0.01), whereas effects of the Cu:Mo ratio and dietary Cu were not significant (P \textgreater 0.05). The interaction between S and Mo affected (P \textless 0.01) G:F, which was likely related to a positive response with the proper balance between these minerals. In conclusion, dietary Cu, Mo, and S and the Cu:Mo ratio caused changes in plasma Cu. Only dietary Mo and S led to a negative response in the performance of growing-finishing cattle, whereas the diet Cu:Mo ratio has a linear and quadratic effect on ADG. Nutritionists and producers need to consider with caution the supplementation of growing-finishing cattle diets with Mo and S because of their potentially adverse effects on animal performance. An appropriate Cu:Mo ratio is desirable to minimize the effects of an impaired supply of Mo on Cu metabolism and ADG.</p>

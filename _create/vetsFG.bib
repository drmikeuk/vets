	abstract = {Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of animal studies are important for improving estimates of the effects of treatment and for guiding future clinical studies on humans. The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the methodological quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of animal studies in dentistry through using a validated checklist. A literature search was conducted independently and in duplicate in the PubMed and LILACS databases. References in selected systematic reviews were assessed to identify other studies not captured by the electronic searches. The methodological quality of studies was assessed independently and in duplicate by using the AMSTAR checklist; the quality was scored as low, moderate, or high. The reviewers were calibrated before the assessment and agreement between them was assessed using Cohen's Kappa statistic. Of 444 studies retrieved, 54 systematic reviews were selected after full-text assessment. Agreement between the reviewers was regarded as excellent. Only two studies were scored as high quality; 17 and 35 studies were scored as medium and low quality, respectively. There is room for improvement of the methodological quality of systematic reviews of animal studies in dentistry. Checklists, such as AMSTAR, can guide researchers in planning and executing systematic reviews and meta-analyses. For determining the need for additional investigations in animals and in order to provide good data for potential application in human, such reviews should be based on animal experiments performed according to sound methodological principles.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anthelmintic drugs have been widely used in sheep as a cost-effective means for gastro-intestinal nematode (GIN) control. However, growing anthelmintic resistance (AHR) has created a compelling need to identify evidence-based management recommendations that reduce the risk of further development and impact of AHR. OBJECTIVE: To identify, critically assess, and synthesize available data from primary research on factors associated with AHR in sheep. METHODS: Publications reporting original observational or experimental research on selected factors associated with AHR in sheep GINs and published after 1974, were identified through two processes. Three electronic databases (PubMed, Agricola, CAB) and Web of Science (a collection of databases) were searched for potentially relevant publications. Additional publications were identified through consultation with experts, manual search of references of included publications and conference proceedings, and information solicited from small ruminant practitioner list-serves. Two independent investigators screened abstracts for relevance. Relevant publications were assessed for risk of systematic bias. Where sufficient data were available, random-effects Meta-Analyses (MAs) were performed to estimate the pooled Odds Ratio (OR) and 95\% Confidence Intervals (CIs) of AHR for factors reported in {\textgreater}/=2 publications. RESULTS: Of the 1712 abstracts screened for eligibility, 131 were deemed relevant for full publication review. Thirty publications describing 25 individual studies (15 observational studies, 7 challenge trials, and 3 controlled trials) were included in the qualitative synthesis and assessed for systematic bias. Unclear (i.e. not reported, or unable to assess) or high risk of selection bias and confounding bias was found in 93\% (14/15) and 60\% (9/15) of the observational studies, respectively, while unclear risk of selection bias was identified in all of the trials. Ten independent studies were included in the quantitative synthesis, and MAs were performed for five factors. Only high frequency of treatment was a significant risk factor (OR=4.39; 95\% CI=1.59, 12.14), while the remaining 4 variables were marginally significant: mixed-species grazing (OR=1.63; 95\% CI=0.66, 4.07); flock size (OR=1.02; 95\% CI=0.97, 1.07); use of long-acting drug formulations (OR=2.85; 95\% CI=0.79, 10.24); and drench-and-shift pasture management (OR=4.08; 95\% CI=0.75, 22.16). CONCLUSIONS: While there is abundant literature on the topic of AHR in sheep GINs, few studies have explicitly investigated the association between putative risk or protective factors and AHR. Consequently, several of the current recommendations on parasite management are not evidence-based. Moreover, many of the studies included in this review had a high or unclear risk of systematic bias, highlighting the need to improve study design and/or reporting of future research carried out in this field.},

Meta-analysis revealed that the probiotics promoted better weight gain and feed conversion than the negative control (no antimicrobial) in the initial phase (1 to 20-28 days); nevertheless, results were similar to the whole duration of the study (1 to 35-48 days). Weight gain and feed conversion were similar between probiotics fed and the positive control (with antimicrobial) birds in the initial and whole experimental period. Sensitivity analysis showed that the results of meta-analysis were coherent. The funnel plots and the Egger regression method revealed that the studies published in Brazil do not present biased results. It is concluded that the probiotics are technically viable alternative to antimicrobial growth promoters in broiler feeding. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to identify the differences among the commercially available probiotics in Brazil.},

	abstract = {Decreasing feed costs while maintaining broiler performance at a high level with minimal environmental pollution has become a major challenge for poultry nutritionists in recent years. In this regard, phosphorus (P) is a nutrient that is problematic. To overcome this, a comprehensive knowledge of the responses of broilers to P is needed and the factors that affect its utilization need better understanding. For this purpose, a meta-analysis was conducted using results published in the literature on the responses of broilers to different levels of nonphytate P (NPP), calcium (Ca), microbial phytase (MP), and vitamin D3 or its metabolites (VD). The effects of Ca, MP, and VD on NPP requirements were investigated. Results showed significant (P {\textless}/= 0.0001) linear and quadratic effects of NPP on all the responses, viz. average daily gain (ADG), feed intake (FI), feed efficiency (FE), and tibia ash concentration (TA). Results showed the negative effect of high Ca levels on all investigated responses, although these deleterious effects were alleviated when levels of NPP were increased or MP and/or VD added. Synergistic effects of MP and VD on FI and TA were observed. Best performance for all responses was found when MP and VD were added to low or moderate levels of Ca and NPP. Optimization showed higher levels of NPP are required to maximize TA compared to ADG, FI, and FE. Based on our analysis, requirements for NPP were affected mostly by Ca (increased) and MP (decreased), and, to a lesser extent, VD (inconsistent).},

In total, 12 estimates for CFT and CFT-CCT test Se and Sp were identified from seven publications matching inclusion criteria. Estimates for CFT test Se ranged from 80.4\% to 93.0\% and CFT test Sp from 89.2\% to 95.2\%. Estimates for CFT-CCT test Se ranged from 74.4\% to 88.4\% and CFT-CCT test Sp ranged from 97.3\% to 98.6\%. These distributions of test Se and Sp are intended to provide a more realistic representation for U.S. bTb skin tests than previously reported. Estimation and discussion of herd-level CFT and CFT-CCT test parameters is also included.

Our literature review indicates that there is a relative lack of published literature that connects veterinary public health educational interventions to population health outcomes. Reasons for the lack of evidence to connect educational programs and population health outcomes include the evaluation of outcomes on a short-term rather than intermediate- or long-term basis, a lack of experimental studies, and infrequent grounding in population health or educational theory.

The initial search for existing publications reporting systematic reviews and primary studies was carried out by searching the available databases. For the final selection of studies, an initial screen for basic eligibility and a detailed appraisal of quality were performed. After study selection, the relevant data were extracted. The detailed appraisal generated 24 publications that reported 52 studies, of which 73.1, 11.5, and 15.4 \% were from cattle, sheep, and goats, respectively. Thirty-three (63.5 \%) of the studies were animal level studies, while 19 (36.5 \%) were herd-/flock-level studies. No flock-level studies on prevalence in sheep were found. Studies in Latin American and Caribbean countries revealed an overall prevalence of 16.9 (95 \% CI (confidence interval) 13.2-20.5) and 75.8 \% (95 \% CI 50.1-101.5) in cattle at the animal and herd levels, respectively; the prevalence was 16 \% (95 \% CI 7.9-24.1) in sheep at the animal level and 4.3 \% (95 \% CI 1.9-6.8) and 3.7 \% (95 \% CI 0.1-7.4) in goats at the animal and flock levels, respectively. In general, prevalence results reported by the studies were insufficient to accurately determine the prevalence of paratuberculosis in farmed animals in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to perform a meta-analysis using literature data on the effects of WPCS hybrid type on intake, digestibility, rumen fermentation, and lactation performance by dairy cows. The meta-analysis was performed using a data set of 162 treatment means from 48 peer-reviewed articles published between 1995 and 2014. Hybrids were divided into 3 categories before analysis. Comparative analysis of WPCS hybrid types differing in stalk characteristics were in 4 categories: conventional, dual-purpose, isogenic, or low-normal fiber digestibility (CONS), brown midrib (BMR), hybrids with greater NDF but lower lignin (\%NDF) contents or high in vitro NDF digestibility (HFD), and leafy (LFY). Hybrid types differing in kernel characteristics were in 4 categories: conventional or yellow dent (CONG), NutriDense (ND), high oil (HO), and waxy. Genetically modified (GM) hybrids were compared with their genetically similar non-biotech counterpart (ISO). Except for lower lignin content for BMR and lower starch content for HFD than CONS and LFY, silage nutrient composition was similar among hybrids of different stalk types. A 1.1 kg/d greater intake of DM and 1.5 and 0.05 kg/d greater milk and protein yields, respectively, were observed for BMR compared with CONS and LFY. Likewise, DMI and milk yield were greater for HFD than CONS, but the magnitude of the difference was smaller. Total-tract NDF digestibility was greater, but starch digestibility was reduced, for BMR and HFD compared with CONS or LFY. Silage nutrient composition was similar for hybrids of varied kernel characteristics, except for lower CP and EE content for CONG than ND and HO. Feeding HO WPCS to dairy cows decreased milk fat content and yield and protein content compared with the other kernel-type hybrids. Hybrids varying in kernel characteristics did not affect intake, milk production, or total-tract nutrient digestibilities by lactating dairy cows. Nutrient composition and lactation performance were similar between GM and ISO. Positive effects of BMR and HFD on intake and milk yield were observed for lactating dairy cows, but the reduced total-tract starch digestibility for these hybrids merits further study. Except for negative effects of HO on milk components, differences were minimal among corn silage hybrids differing in kernel type. Feeding GM WPCS did not affect lactation performance by dairy cows.},

The aim of this study was to determine whether there is evidence that the use of MCT reduces consumption and body weight gain in rats, a species chosen as it has been widely used as an animal model in different surveys. A search of scientific work was performed in November 2011 on two bases: 'Web of Science' and 'PubMed'. The terms sample size and homogeneity, randomisation, food consumption and weight gain, body composition, enzyme activity and hormonal activity in rats were used as selection criteria. Thirteen papers were selected after the refinement of the research. Twelve studies measured weight gain and among these, seven detected a decrease in weight gain and five found no differences. Twelve papers also measured food intake and among these, four detected a decrease in consumption, one detected an increase and seven found no differences. Based on established criteria for the ranking of scientific papers, it is concluded that there is strong evidence that MCTs can effectively reduce the consumption and subsequent weight gain of animals. However, in the long term, there may not be differences in results depending on the phenotypic adaptation of animals to a new metabolic condition.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) is gaining popularity as part of therapy programs in residential aged care facilities. Humans and pet dogs respond to quiet interaction with a lowering of blood pressure and an increase in neurochemicals associated with relaxation and bonding. These effects may be of benefit in ameliorating behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). METHODS: Medline, PsychInfo and CINAHL databases (1960-2005) were searched for papers on AAT or pets and dementia. Publications of controlled trials that measured the effect of AAT for dementia were reviewed. RESULTS: Several small studies suggest that the presence of a dog reduces aggression and agitation, as well as promoting social behavior in people with dementia. One study has shown that aquaria in dining rooms of dementia care units stimulate residents to eat more of their meals and to gain weight but is limited by the small number of facilities studied. There is preliminary evidence that robotic pets may provide pleasure and interest to people with dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Current literature suggests that AAT may ameliorate BPSD, but the duration of the beneficial effect has not been explored. The relative benefits of "resident" versus "visiting" pet dogs are unclear and are confounded by the positive effect of pet interaction on staff or caregivers. Further research on the potential benefits of AAT is recommended.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Domestic cats have evolved from solitary, asocial predators and whilst they may display social behaviours, they can still exist as solitary survivors. Over-population and relinquishment of pet cats are ubiquitous problems worldwide, and rehoming centres (also known as rescues/ shelters) aim to ameliorate this by holding cats in confinement for a variable period until a new home is found. The provision of optimal housing for large numbers of cats in close confinement, such as in rehoming centres, is therefore inherently difficult. Under these conditions there is the potential for individuals to develop signs of physical and psychological ill health, and thus experience compromised welfare. Available information regarding housing practices that maximise welfare currently provides conflicting results, and as a consequence there are no unanimous housing recommendations. The aim of this study was therefore to review the evidence on the impact of single housing compared to multi-cat housing on stress in confined cats, as measured by physiological and/or behavioural outcomes. The review was conducted using a Critically Appraised Topic (CAT) format. A systematic search of electronic databases (CAB Abstracts, Zoological Records and Medline) was carried out to identify peer-reviewed literature comparing single and multi-cat housing in confined environments. RESULTS: A total of 959 papers were initially identified, six of which met sufficient criteria based on their relevance to be included within this review. All of the studies had significant limitations in design and methodology, including a lack of information on how groups were assigned, inconsistent handling and enrichment provision between groups, and lack of information on the socialisation status of cats. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst some studies suggested that single housing may be less stressful for cats, others suggested group housing was less stressful. Several other important factors were however identified as potential mediators of stress within the different housing systems, and recommendations based upon these findings are presented.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine systematically the evidence on sample acquisition and handling for the thrombo elastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) viscoelastic point of care instruments and to identify knowledge gaps. DESIGN: Six questions were considered, addressing sampling site, collection system, anticoagulant, collection procedure, and sample storage. Standardized, systematic evaluation of the literature was performed. Relevant articles were categorized according to level of evidence (LOE). Consensus was developed regarding conclusions for application of concepts to clinical practice. SETTING: Academic and referral veterinary medical centers. RESULTS: PubMed and CAB abstracts were searched. Eighteen papers were initially chosen; 5 of these papers applied to {\textgreater} 1 domain question. Three papers were used to address 2 questions each, and 2 papers were used to address 3 questions each. Most papers were judged LOE 3 (Good or Fair). Two of 5 papers were judged to be the same LOE each time they were used; 2 papers were judged to be LOE 3, Fair for 1 question and 3, Good for a second question; 1 paper used to address 3 questions was judged LOE 3, Good twice and 3, Fair once. Fourteen additional papers were evaluated post hoc during manuscript preparation. CONCLUSIONS: Jugular venipuncture is recommended, but samples from IV catheters can be used. Consistent technique is important for serial sampling, and standardized sampling protocols are recommended for individual centers performing TEG/ROTEM. There is insufficient evidence to recommend use of a specific blood collection system, although use of evacuated blood tubes and 21-Ga or larger needles is suggested. Use of 3.2\% buffered sodium citrate in a strict 1:9 ratio of citrate to blood is suggested. Suggested tube draw order is discard/serum, followed by citrate, EDTA, and then heparin. Samples should be held at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to analysis.},

Only papers in English in peer-reviewed journals were selected for analysis of post 1960 data from intensive dairy regions. Seventy papers fulfilled the selection criteria. Summary estimates of disease effects were calculated according to meta-analysis methods, and study designs were described in detail to identify possible heterogeneity of the results. Stillbirth, milk fever, displaced abomasum and mastitis had no effect on reproduction. Clinical ketosis, dystocia and retained placenta were associated with 2 to 3 more days to first service and with a 4 to 10\% lower conception rate at first service, resulting in 6 to 12 more days to conception. Locomotor disorders were associated with an average increase of 12 d to conception, with wide variation depending on lesions and stage of occurrence. Metritis was associated with 7 more days to first service, 20\% lower conception rate at first service, resulting in 19 more days to conception. Cystic ovaries were associated with 6 to 11 more days to first service and with 20 to 30 more days to conception. Anestrus was associated with 26 more days to first service and with an 18\% lower conception rate at first service, resulting in 41 more days to conception.

PROCEDURES: The MEDLINE and CAB Abstracts databases were searched with the following key terms: dog OR dogs OR canine OR cat OR cats OR feline AND pheromone OR synthetic pheromone OR facial pheromone OR appeasing pheromone. A date limit was set from 1998 through 2008. Identified reports for dogs (n = 7) and cats (7) were systematically reviewed. RESULTS: Studies provided insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of feline facial pheromone for management of idiopathic cystitis or calming cats during catheterization and lack of support for reducing stress in hospitalized cats. Only 1 study yielded sufficient evidence that dog-appeasing pheromone reduces fear or anxiety in dogs during training. Six studies yielded insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of dog-appeasing pheromone for treatment of noise phobia (2 reports), travel-related problems, fear or anxiety in the veterinary clinic, and stress- and fear-related behavior in shelter dogs as well as vocalizing and house soiling in recently adopted puppies. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: 11 of the 14 reports reviewed provided insufficient evidence and 1 provided lack of support for effectiveness of pheromones for the treatment of undesirable behavior in cats and dogs.},

	abstract = {Personality, or consistent individual differences in behavior, is well established in studies of dogs. Such consistency implies predictability of behavior, but some recent research suggests that predictability cannot be assumed. In addition, anecdotally, many dog experts believe that 'puppy tests' measuring behavior during the first year of a dog's life are not accurate indicators of subsequent adult behavior. Personality consistency in dogs is an important aspect of human-dog relationships (e.g., when selecting dogs suitable for substance-detection work or placement in a family). Here we perform the first comprehensive meta-analysis of studies reporting estimates of temporal consistency of dog personality. A thorough literature search identified 31 studies suitable for inclusion in our meta-analysis. Overall, we found evidence to suggest substantial consistency (r = 0.43). Furthermore, personality consistency was higher in older dogs, when behavioral assessment intervals were shorter, and when the measurement tool was exactly the same in both assessments. In puppies, aggression and submissiveness were the most consistent dimensions, while responsiveness to training, fearfulness, and sociability were the least consistent dimensions. In adult dogs, there were no dimension-based differences in consistency. There was no difference in personality consistency in dogs tested first as puppies and later as adults (e.g., 'puppy tests') versus dogs tested first as puppies and later again as puppies. Finally, there were no differences in consistency between working versus non-working dogs, between behavioral codings versus behavioral ratings, and between aggregate versus single measures. Implications for theory, practice, and future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {Research synthesis, using techniques such as meta-analysis to combine the results of a number of studies, is a particularly useful technique when there are multiple studies with conflicting results, or where there may be conflicting interests, and can serve to extract the maximum information from animal experiments. The effect of conventional cages and alternative housing systems on measures of production, behaviour, physical and physiological condition in laying hens is an important question that would benefit from research synthesis. We found that statistical constraints did not allow the usual methods of meta-analysis, so as a first step towards quantitative comparison, we used a simple vote-counting approach based on the treatment means. We counted the number of papers in which conventional cages or alternative systems had a higher weighted mean for various response variables. Egg production was higher in conventional cages than in alternative systems, though this effect was probably mostly confined to the comparison with multi-level indoor systems. Bones were stronger from hens kept in alternative systems than those kept in conventional cages. We confirmed previous reviews that birds show more comfort behaviour and possibly dustbathing (or vacuum dustbathing) behaviour in alternative systems, but aggressive pecking did not differ between systems. Perhaps surprisingly, mortality, feather pecking and body wounds were not found to differ between systems. The latter findings suggest that the chance of a mortality or cannibalism outbreak may be no greater in alternative systems than in cage systems, but it should be noted that our analysis did not consider the magnitude of the difference in mortality. In conclusion, the meta-comparison undertaken here supports some but contradicts other conclusions reached in qualitative reviews.},

Use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) is a tool which may maintain the intestinal microbial balance, prevent diarrhea and improve growth. However, a consensus has not been reached as to whether probiotics are effective in improving growth of calves. The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess effects of probiotics on the growth of calves (\_i.e.\_, body weight gain (BWG), feed efficiency). PubMed and Scopus databases were searched from 1980 to 2010, unrestricted by language. The inclusion criteria were: randomized and controlled experiments using calves less than 5 d of age without apparent disease and with passive immunity, and published in peer reviewed journals. Twenty-one and 14 studies were included to assess probiotic effects on BWG and feed efficiency, respectively. LAB supplementation increased BWG (standardized mean differences (SMD)=0.22822, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.1006-0.4638) and improve feed efficiency (SMD=-0.8141, 95\% CI -1.2222 to -0.4059), considering the source of heterogeneity and publication biases. Growth of calves was not affected when the LAB was added to whole milk, but beneficial effects occurred when LAB was added to milk replacer. The probiotic effect was not related to the number of LAB strains in the inoculum. The number of calves in the experiments had an impact on the results and conclusions. Probiotics may be an alternative to the antibiotics commonly used as growth promoters in calves.},

	abstract = {The importance of livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) as an infectious agent for humans has increased in recent years in Germany. Although it is well known that the prevalence of MRSA in pig farms is high, risk factors for the presence of MRSA in herds of fattening pigs are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate available data from previous studies on MRSA in fattening pigs in a meta-analysis to answer the question: What are the factors associated with the occurrence of MRSA in fattening pig herds? The studies on MRSA in pigs that were identified by literature research were heterogeneous with respect to the risk factors investigated and the type of herds focused on. Therefore we decided to carry out a pooling analysis on herd level rather than a typical meta-analysis. Eligible herd data were identified based on the published literature and communication with the authors. The final data set covered 400 fattening pig herds from 10 different studies and 12 risk factors. The prevalence of MRSA in the 400 fattening pig herds was 53.5\%. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE). The resulting multivariate model confirmed previously identified risk factors for MRSA in pig herds (herd size and herd type). It also identified further risk factors: group treatment of fattening pigs with antimicrobial drugs (OR=1.79) and housing fattening pig herds on at least partially slatted floors (OR=2.39) compared to plain floor. In contrast, according to the model, fattening pig herds on farms keeping other livestock along with pigs were less likely to harbor MRSA (OR=0.54). The results underline the benefits from a pooling analysis and cooperative re-evaluation of published data.},

Glenn, Bacon, \& Hanlin comb. Nov.] tall fescue [ (Schreb.) Darbysh.]. The strategies presented include those 1) applied with forage systems, 2) based on pharmacological compounds and functional foods, and 3) based on supplemental dietary nutrients. Cattle BW gain and DM intake was the dependent response evaluated. Among the forage systems reviewed, studies with nontoxic, endophyte-infected tall fescue as a total replacement forage system demonstrated the greatest improvement in per-hectare (152 +/- 27.5 kg/ha) and per-animal (0.29 +/- 0.03 kg/d) BW gain. Studies with interseeded legumes have exhibited a small and highly variable BW gain effect size per hectare (52 +/- 24.1 kg/ha) and per animal (0.11 +/- 0.03 kg/d). The legume response was seasonal, with summer exhibiting the greatest benefit. Studies with chemicals that suppress plant growth demonstrated BW gain responses (0.17 +/- 0.06 kg/d) equal to or greater than the response observed with legume studies. Cattle grazing toxic tall fescue responded well to anthelmentics, antimicrobial feed additives, and steroid implants, and the use of these technologies may additively help recover production losses. As a group, functional foods have not improved BW gain ( = 0.85). Studies with cattle supplemented with highly digestible fiber supplements observed a 0.15 kg greater BW gain compared with studies using starch- and sugar-based supplements ( {\textless} 0.05). Weight gain was positively impacted by the level of supplementation (0.06 kg/DM intake as percent BW). Supplement feed conversion was estimated at 6:1 for the highly digestible fiber supplements compared with 11:1 for starch-based supplements. Tall fescue forage DM intake was predicted to maximize at a supplemental feeding rate of 0.24\% BW with a breakpoint at 0.5\% BW, and total maximum DM intake (forage plus supplement) occurred at 2.7\% BW when supplemental feeding approached 0.9\% BW. Results from this meta-analysis should be useful for 1) establishing and comparing measured responses to theoretical improvements in BW gain when additive strategies are considered, 2) research planning, and 3) producer education.},

	abstract = {One of the main Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyopneumoniae) swine experimental model objectives is to reproduce mycoplasmal pneumonia (MP). Unfortunately, experimental validated protocols to maximize the chance to successfully achieve lung lesions induced by M. hyopneumoniae are not available at the moment. Thus, the objective of this work was to identify those factors that might have a major influence on the effective development of MP, measured as macroscopic lung lesions, under experimental conditions. Data from 85 studies describing M. hyopneumoniae inoculation experiments were compiled by means of a systematic review and analyzed thereafter. Several variables were considered in the analyses such as the number of pigs in the experiment, serological status against M. hyopneumoniae, source of the animals, age at inoculation, type of inoculum, strain of M. hyopneumoniae, route, dose and times of inoculation, study duration and co-infection with other swine pathogens. Descriptive statistics were used to depict M. hyopneumoniae experimental model main characteristics whereas a recursive partitioning approach, using regression trees, assessed the importance of the abovementioned experimental variables as MP triggering factors. A strong link between the time period between challenge and necropsies and lung lesion severity was observed. Results indicated that the most important factors to explain the observed lung lesion score variability were: (1) study duration, (2) M. hyopneumoniae strain, (3) age at inoculation, (4) co-infection with other swine pathogens and (5) animal source. All other studied variables were not relevant to explain the variability on M. hyopneumoniae lung lesions. The results provided in the present work may serve as a basis for debate in the search for a universally accepted M. hyopneumoniae challenge model.},

Felid personality research comes from various fields, and is often carried out with different methods, with diverse goals. This review evaluates the published research on felid personality, and addresses its reliability and validity. Only 60\% of the studies reported reliability estimates, and these varied greatly across personality dimensions. The sample weighted mean correlation of the reliability estimates was 0.68 (based on three studies). Fifty-five percent of the studies assessed validity. The personality dimensions with the highest validity for all species were Sociable, Dominant, and Curious, with a mean correlation of 0.82. Recommendations for future research and implications for aiding in conservation and captive animal management efforts and improving health and well-being and welfare are discussed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Toxoplasmosis is a worldwide zoonosis. The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence and assess the potential risk factors of Toxoplasma gondii infections in animals and humans in Ethiopia by using meta-analytical methods. METHODS: Published studies on T. gondii in animals and humans in Ethiopia were searched in Medline, Google Scholar and the lists of references of articles. Eligible studies were selected by using inclusion and exclusion criteria. The risks of within and across study biases, and the variations in prevalence estimates attributable to heterogeneities were assessed. Pooled prevalence was estimated by the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. RESULTS: Thirty two studies were eligible and data from 5689 animals and 5718 humans were used for quantitative syntheses. The pooled IgG seroprevalence in cats, small ruminants and humans were estimated at 87.72\% (95\% CI = 78.63, 93.28), 34.59\% (95\% CI = 21.08, 51.12) and 74.73\% (95\% CI = 61.85, 84.36), respectively. The odds of infections were higher in pregnant than in non pregnant women (OR = 3.96), in individuals that had contact with cats than those with no contact (OR = 2.53), and in urban than in rural inhabitants (OR = 2.06). CONCLUSIONS: Toxoplasmosis is highly prevalent and could be a cause of considerable reproductive wastage in small ruminants and multiple diseases in humans in Ethiopia. Public education on preventive measures could help reduce the transmission of the parasite to humans.},

There is however increasing evidence that intralesional treatments with cells, blood products, scaffolds and biological factors such as growth factors have a regenerative effect. In the present review the principal scientific findings on the clinical effects in living horses of, for example, bone-marrow-derived and adipose-tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and blood products such as PRP (platelet rich plasma), ACP (autologous conditioned plasma) and ACS (autologous conditioned serum) are summarized and discussed. Relating to horses, several scientific investigations with different study designs can be found in the literature: (1) Clinical case series, which allow a limited comparison of different treatment methods on the basis of the resulting recurrence rate. (2) Experimental animal studies on controlled artificial tendon defects, which often provide detailed results on the histological, biochemical and biomechanical quality of repair tissue. (3) Single placebo-controlled studies of naturally occurring tendinopathies which should, at least theoretically, provide the highest degree of evidence, however show methodological weaknesses in many cases. Among other aspects, the advantages and disadvantages of the various substrates, their biological safety, their effect with regard to the structural and biomechanical properties of different tendons and ligaments and their effect on the recurrence rate of tendon and ligament disorders are described and discussed. There is increasing evidence that substrates with regenerative potential are superior to other, i.e. conventional, treatments although it is still not clear which product or combination of substrates is most appropriate in individual cases.},

Therefore, in recent years so-called regenerative therapeutics were studied scientifically in vitro and in laboratory animals. These include substances that ideally lead to the formation of replacement tissue, which in contrast to the low quality scar, has similar functional properties as the original intact tendon. Currently, a plethora of different substrates is either commercially available or can be produced in practice with the help of kits. The current knowledge on the production and the regenerative potential of nucleated cells like stem cells from bone marrow and fat tissue, of the blood products PRP (platelet rich plasma), ACP (autologous conditioned plasma), ACS (autologous conditioned serum) and of the scaffold substance UBM (urinary bladder matrix) are presented. Finally, the potential of some growth factors and of gene therapy is considered. Currently, it is assumed that the regeneration of tendon tissue is promoted by a complex interaction of scaffolds, growth factors and cells. At present, only very few studies are available which allow a comparison between these substances. Studies on the effect of regenerative substrates on tendons in live horses are presented elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Mastitis is among the most prevalent disease that contributes for the reduction of milk production in dairy herds. Although several published studies have estimated the prevalence of mastitis, variation among studies is great. The objective of the present meta-analysis was to provide a pooled estimate of the prevalence of overall, clinical, and subclinical mastitis in dairy cattle in Ethiopia. A pooled estimate was also conducted by potential risk factors. The literature search was restricted to studies published in English language from January 2002 to June 2016. Meta-analysis of 39 studies was done under random effects model using metafor package in R software. The pooled estimate of the overall prevalence of mastitis on cow-basis was found to be 47.0\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 42.0, 52.0). The pooled prevalence with the 95\% CI for clinical and subclinical mastitis was 8.3\% (95\% CI = 6.5, 10.3) and 37\% (95\% CI = 32.9, 40.7) respectively. There is a statistically significant and high heterogeneity of the prevalence estimates between published studies. The odds of occurrence of mastitis were higher in cows at early (odds ratio [OR] = 1.6; 95\% CI = 1.4, 1.8) and late lactation (OR = 1.3; 95\% CI = 1.2, 1.5) than mid lactation, in cows with 3-4 (OR = 1.5; 95\% CI = 1.4, 1.7) and {\textgreater}4 parity number (OR = 2.9; 95\% CI = 2.6, 3.4) than those with 1-2 parity number. Previous history of mastitis, floor type, milking hygiene, and udder injury had also statistically significant effect on pooled prevalence of mastitis (P {\textless} 0.05). The present study reported that there is high prevalence of mastitis in dairy cows in Ethiopia, which could contribute to the low productivity in lactating cows. The statistically significant association of risk factors such as floor type, milking hygiene, and presence of udder injury with mastitis may suggest that dairy farmers can reduce the occurrence of the disease by improving their management practices.},

	abstract = {Steroid sex hormones are potential neuroprotective candidates following CNS injury. All clinical trials to date have examined the effects of oestrogen alone or oestrogen-progestin combination therapy. Experimental studies have suggested that progesterone, in its own right, is a potential neuroprotective agent following acute cerebral injury. We performed a systematic review of controlled animal studies that administered progesterone before, or after, acute cerebral injury and measured lesion volume. Relevant studies were found from searching PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. From 119 identified publications, data from 18 studies using 480 experimental subjects met specific criteria and were analysed using the Cochrane Review Manager software. Following cerebral ischaemia, a significant benefit of progesterone was observed regardless of the assigned study quality score (P = 0.0002) whereas, following traumatic brain injury (TBI) a significant benefit of progesterone was only observed in studies that obtained the highest quality score of 5 (P = 0.02). Progesterone reduced lesion volume in a dose-dependent manner following either cerebral ischaemia (P {\textless} 0.001) or TBI (P = 0.03) with the most effective progesterone dose varying according to experimental injury model used. Progesterone treatment was only effective at reducing lesion volume when administered immediately following (i.e. 0-2 h) cerebral ischaemia (P = 0.0008). No studies using models of cerebral ischaemia or TBI assessed efficacy when progesterone was administered at later than 6 h following the onset of cerebral injury. Limited data were available for different groups of animals according to age/hormonal status and the full dose-response relationship was not available in all experimental groups. Although this systematic review provides some supporting evidence for a neuroprotective role of progesterone following either cerebral ischaemia or TBI importantly it highlights areas which need further pre-clinical investigation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QOL) is an important consideration in healthcare decision-making for pets with cancer. To determine the effect of disease and treatment on pet QOL, this important variable should be objectively measured as an outcome in veterinary cancer studies. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and methodology of QOL measurement in a sample of recently published reports of prospective studies evaluating cancer treatments in client-owned dogs and cats; to characterize reporting of QOL outcomes and to identify article characteristics associated with QOL measurement. METHODS: English-language reports of prospective studies of cancer treatments in dogs and cats published from 2008 to 2013 were identified using medical research databases combined with a hand-searching strategy. Data pertaining to general article characteristics and QOL measurement were abstracted and summarized. RESULTS: Reports of 144 eligible studies were identified. QOL was measured in 16 (11.1\%) studies, with 8 (5.6\%) reporting the results. All studies that measured QOL reported using unvalidated instruments, or did not report how QOL was assessed. Only 1 study provided sufficient information for QOL measurements to be replicated. Recently published articles (2011-2013) were significantly more likely to report measuring QOL, compared with earlier articles. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life of pets undergoing cancer treatment is largely unreported and cannot be meaningfully compared across treatments or disease states using the existing literature. Reliable, validated instruments are needed to facilitate the measurement and comparison of pet QOL in veterinary cancer research. Consistent reporting practices could improve transparency and interpretation of QOL results.},

	abstract = {Bat-borne viruses carry undeniable risks to the health of human beings and animals, and there is growing recognition of the need for a 'One Health' approach to understand their frequently complex spill-over routes. While domesticated animals can play central roles in major spill-over events of zoonotic bat-borne viruses, for example during the pig-amplified Malaysian Nipah virus outbreak of 1998-1999, the extent of their potential to act as bridging or amplifying species for these viruses has not been characterised systematically. This review aims to compile current knowledge on the role of domesticated animals as hosts of two types of bat-borne viruses, henipaviruses and filoviruses. A systematic literature search of these virus-host interactions in domesticated animals identified 72 relevant studies, which were categorised by year, location, design and type of evidence generated. The review then focusses on Africa as a case study, comparing research efforts in domesticated animals and bats with the distributions of documented human cases. Major gaps remain in our knowledge of the potential ability of domesticated animals to contract or spread these zoonoses. Closing these gaps will be necessary to fully evaluate and mitigate spill-over risks of these viruses, especially with global agricultural intensification.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically examine the evidence relating to the performance of rotational viscoelastic testing in companion animals, to develop assay guidelines, and to identify knowledge gaps. DESIGN: Multiple questions were considered within 5 parent domains, specifically system comparability, sample handling, assay activation and test protocol, definitions and data reporting, and nonstandard assays. Standardized, systematic evaluation of the literature was performed. Relevant articles were categorized according to level of evidence and assessed for quality. Consensus was developed regarding conclusions for application of concepts to clinical practice. SETTING: Academic and referral veterinary medical centers. RESULTS: Databases searched included Medline, Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux abstracts, and Google Scholar. Worksheets were prepared evaluating 28 questions across the 5 domains and generating 84 assay guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based guidelines for the performance of thromboelastography in companion animals were generated through this process. Some of these guidelines are well supported while others will benefit from additional evidence. Many knowledge gaps were identified and future work should be directed to address these gaps and to objectively evaluate the impact of these guidelines on assay comparability within and between centers.},

Each study was analysed and summarised in terms of (a) strategies used to evoke anxiety, (b) non-verbal behavioural indicators of anxiety and (c) physiological indicators of anxiety. Results: Eighteen strategies were used to evoke anxiety, 48 non-verbal behavioural indicators and 17 physiological indicators of anxiety were measured. Conclusions: A number of the strategies used with non-human primates, if modified carefully, could be considered in the ongoing effort to study anxiety in individuals with ASD. Potential applications to the assessment of anxiety in humans with ASD are discussed.},

Means of crown-rump length (CRL) and BW records, as well as means of calculated G index (GI, BW/CRL1.5), body mass index (BMI, BW/CRL2.0), and Ponderal index (PI, BW/CRL3.0) of 195 nontreated and 160 treated groups of lambs from 131 studies were investigated by ANOVA. the GI is a novel BW-body length index developed for sheep fetuses and newborn lambs. The analysis included the effects of study (n=131), treatment (n=38), average litter size (1 to 3), and days in pregnancy (120 d to lambing). The morphometric parameters were obtained on average on d 139 of gestation, when lambs in the nontreated groups averaged 0.50 m for CRL and 4.20 kg for BW. applying the different treatments caused substantial variation in fetal BW (from 2.5 to 4.9 kg), and somewhat less variation in fetal CRL (0.41 to 0.55 m), reflecting ovine fetal ability to adapt its growth to a variety of natural and experimental constraints. Some treatments affected (P{\textless}0.05) the fetal BW-body length relationship, as clearly reflected by the GI and BMI, but not by the PI. litter size and days in pregnancy had effects (P{\textless}0.05) on all variables. It was concluded that the severity of fetal intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) in the case of multifetus pregnancies is comparable with the IUGR effects caused by experimentally induced fetal growth-inhibiting interventions, and that GI may be superior to BMI and PI in detecting interference with ovine fetal body proportion.},

This systematic review, following Cochrane Collaboration (CC) guidelines, critically appraises the level of evidence on factors influencing remission rate and factors predicting remission. A systematic online, bibliographic search and reference list examination was conducted. A level of evidence was assigned to each identified article by five internists using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for follow-up, cohort, case-series and case-control studies, the CC's risk of bias tool for trials and the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group risk of bias criteria for before and after trials. Twenty-two studies were included in the review, assessing influence of pharmaceutical intervention (n = 14) and diet (n = 4), as well as diagnostic tests (n = 9) and feline patient characteristics (n = 5) as predictors of remission. The current level of evidence was found to be moderate to poor. Common sources of bias included lack of randomisation and blinding among trials, and many studies were affected by small sample size. Failure to provide criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes, or diabetic remission, and poor control of confounding factors were frequent causes of poor study design. Addressing these factors would significantly strengthen future research and ultimately allow meta-analyses to provide an excellent level of evidence. No single factor predicts remission and successful remission has been documented with a variety of insulin types and protocols. Dietary carbohydrate reduction might be beneficial, but requires further study. A lack of well-designed trials prevents reliable remission rate comparison. Factors associated with remission resemble those in human medicine and support the hypothesis that reversal of glucotoxicity is a major underlying mechanism for feline diabetic remission.},

In total we downloaded 1,125 abstracts, which were classified into the following categories: year of publication; environment of the study (e.g., zoo) or theoretical; area of knowledge (e.g., conservation in situ); number of experimental animals used; species; addresses of authors; taxonomic classification; publication language; journal name; number of citations received. Since 1990, there has been a rapid increase in the number of articles published in this area of animal welfare. One worrying result was that published articles were predominately of a theoretical nature (58.65\%, N=563). Most of the articles were published by authors either in Europe (47.43\%, N=480) or North America (37.65\%, N=381) and written in English (87.71\%, N=971). The majority of experimental studies were conducted with mammals (75.92\%, N=391), and had small sample sizes (N=7 for zoo-based studies). In terms of impact factor (IF), the journals in this study had a median factor equivalent to that for the area of biological sciences (median IF=1.013). Little knowledge cross-over from farm animal welfare was found (only four articles) in this study.

	abstract = {The efficacy of contraceptive treatments has been extensively tested, and several formulations are effective at reducing fertility in a range of species. However, these formulations should minimally impact the behavior of individuals and populations before a contraceptive is used for population manipulation, but these effects have received less attention. Potential side effects have been identified theoretically and we reviewed published studies that have investigated side effects on behavior and physiology of individuals or population-level effects, which provided mixed results. Physiological side effects were most prevalent. Most studies reported a lack of secondary effects, but were usually based on qualitative data or anecdotes. A meta-analysis on quantitative studies of side effects showed that secondary effects consistently occur across all categories and all contraceptive types. This contrasts with the qualitative studies, suggesting that anecdotal reports are insufficient to investigate secondary impacts of contraceptive treatment. We conclude that more research is needed to address fundamental questions about secondary effects of contraceptive treatment and experiments are fundamental to conclusions. In addition, researchers are missing a vital opportunity to use contraceptives as an experimental tool to test the influence of reproduction, sex and fertility on the behavior of wildlife species.},

	abstract = {Results from primary processing intervention strategies for \_Escherichia coli\_ reduction on beef carcasses are often inconsistent or contradictory. Our objective was to identify, critically evaluate and synthesize published intervention research reporting treatment efficacy at the abattoir on \_E. coli\_ contamination of beef carcasses using systematic review (SR)-meta-analysis (MA) methodology to recommend effective practices and determine knowledge gaps. Four electronic bibliographic databases were searched for intervention studies in English. Two independent reviewers performed all SR steps. Risk of bias was assessed and separate random-effects MAs conducted on datasets. A stochastic simulation model using MA effect estimates evaluated combined effects of potable water carcass wash, steam or hot water pasteurization and a 24 h dry chill. The SR-MA included 36 citations (202 trials). Although 44 interventions were identified at nine stages of processing, MA was precluded for most due to small study numbers, high risk of bias and heterogeneity. Reduced odds of generic \_E. coli\_ carcass contamination demonstrated by MA: final carcass washing (OR 0.56, CI: 0.41-0.77), pasteurization (OR 0.09, CI: 0.06-0.14) and 24 h dry chilling (OR 0.17, CI: 0.11-0.24). Combining effects of potable water carcass wash, steam or hot water pasteurization and a 24 h dry chill, assuming no additional contamination and all variables constant, resulted in a reduced prevalence of 1.22\% (CI 0.17, 3.57). The predicted risk difference in carcass contamination was 14, 42 and 35 per 100 carcasses upon application of final wash, carcass pasteurization and 24 h dry chill, respectively. Existing research indicates that final wash, hot water or steam pasteurization, and dry chilling are beneficial for reducing the contamination of beef carcasses with generic \_E. coli\_ and potentially pathogenic strains.},

However, literature summarizing the time between pathogen exposure and clinical signs, shedding, and seroconversion is minimal. A structured literature review of the published literature was performed to determine cattle responses (time from pathogen exposure to clinical signs, shedding, and seroconversion) in challenge models using common BRD viral and bacterial pathogens. After review a descriptive analysis of published studies using common BRD pathogen challenge studies was performed. Inclusion criteria were single pathogen challenge studies with no treatment or vaccination evaluating outcomes of interest: clinical signs, shedding, and seroconversion. Pathogens of interest included: bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), parainfluenza-3 virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, Mannheimia haemolytica, Mycoplasma bovis, Pastuerella multocida, and Histophilus somni. Thirty-five studies and 64 trials were included for analysis. The median days to the resolution of clinical signs after BVDV challenge was 15 and shedding was not detected on day 12 postchallenge. Resolution of BHV-1 shedding resolved on day 12 and clinical signs on day 12 postchallenge. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus ceased shedding on day 9 and median time to resolution of clinical signs was on day 12 postchallenge. M. haemolytica resolved clinical signs 8 days postchallenge. This literature review and descriptive analysis can serve as a resource to assist in designing challenge model studies and potentially aid in estimation of duration of clinical disease and shedding after natural pathogen exposure.},

Considering both public and animal health, providing consolidated prevalence data could be relevant within the decision process of public policy makers or producers organizations. The objective of this study was to conduct a critical review of the literature focused on the prevalence of C. burnetii infection at animal, herd and within-herd levels in cattle, goat and sheep. A qualitative assessment of the 69 selected publications, based on the analysis of the sampling frame and testing procedures, was also performed. While the number of publications increased recently, major methodological issues were still evidenced. These critical issues were related to (i) the absence of description of the sampling strategy and (ii) the lack of sensitivity of the testing procedure. The lack of well designed studies makes not possible to estimate accurately the current prevalence of the infection. Nevertheless, the literature review reported the detection of C. burnetii infection in the all 5 continents with a wide range whatever the species. The apparent prevalence was slightly higher in cattle (20.0\% and 37.7\% of mean apparent prevalence at animal and herd level respectively) than in small ruminants (around 15.0\% and 25\% respectively for animal and herd level in sheep and goat). The present conclusions and the current situation support the persistent need of conducting well designed studies, aiming at estimating the true prevalence of C. burnetii infection in the three main domestic ruminant species.},

A systematic review of peer-reviewed studies to generate a single outcome may overcome this problem. The contentious topic of the impact that a megaherbivore such as the savanna elephant have for other species and their environment can benefit from such an approach. After some 68 years, 367 peer-reviewed papers covered the topic and 51 of these papers provided sufficient data to be included in a meta-analysis. We separated the direct impact that elephants had on trees and herbs from the indirect effects on other vertebrates, invertebrates, and soil properties. Elephants have an impact on tree structure and abundance but no overall negative cascading effects for species that share space with them. Primary productivity explained a small amount of variation of elephant impact on vegetation. Elephant numbers (density), study duration, rainfall, tree cover, and the presence of artificial water and fences failed to describe patterns of impact. We conclude that published information do not support the calls made for artificially manipulating elephant numbers to ameliorate elephant impact, and call for the management of space use by elephants to maintain savanna heterogeneity.},

Inadequate reporting of key aspects of experimental design may reduce the impact of studies and could act as a barrier to translation of research findings. Reporting of animal use must be as comprehensive as possible in order to take advantage of every study and every animal used. Animal models are essential to understanding and assessing new chemotherapy candidates for Chagas disease pathology, a widespread parasitic disease with few treatment options currently available. A systematic review was carried out to compare ARRIVE guidelines recommendations with information provided in publications of preclinical studies for new anti-Trypanosoma cruzi compounds. A total of 83 publications were reviewed. Before ARRIVE guidelines, 69\% of publications failed to report any macroenvironment information, compared to 57\% after ARRIVE publication. Similar proportions were observed when evaluating reporting of microenvironmental information (56\% vs. 61\%). Also, before ARRIVE guidelines publication, only 13\% of papers described animal gender, only 18\% specified microbiological status and 13\% reported randomized treatment assignment, among other essential information missing or incomplete. Unfortunately, publication of ARRIVE guidelines did not seem to enhance reporting quality, compared to papers appeared before ARRIVE publication. Our results suggest that there is a strong need for the scientific community to improve animal use description, animal models employed, transparent reporting and experiment design to facilitate its transfer and application to the affected human population. Full compliance with ARRIVE guidelines, or similar animal research reporting guidelines, would be an excellent start in this direction.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of protozoa concentration on methane emission from ruminants. A database was built from 59 publications reporting data from 76 in vivo experiments. The experiments included in the database recorded methane production and rumen protozoa concentration measured on the same groups of animals. Quantitative data such as diet chemical composition, rumen fermentation and microbial parameters, and qualitative information such as methane mitigation strategies were also collected. In the database, 31\% of the experiments reported a concomitant reduction of both protozoa concentration and methane emission (g/kg dry matter intake). Nearly all of these experiments tested lipids as methane mitigation strategies. By contrast, 21\% of the experiments reported a variation in methane emission without changes in protozoa numbers, indicating that methanogenesis is also regulated by other mechanisms not involving protozoa. Experiments that used chemical compounds as an antimethanogenic treatment belonged to this group. The relationship between methane emission and protozoa concentration was studied with a variance-covariance model, with experiment as a fixed effect. The experiments included in the analysis had a within-experiment variation of protozoa concentration higher than 5.3 log10 cells/ml corresponding to the average s.e.m. of the database for this variable. To detect potential interfering factors for the relationship, the influence of several qualitative and quantitative secondary factors was tested. This meta-analysis showed a significant linear relationship between methane emission and protozoa concentration: methane (g/kg dry matter intake)=-30.7+8.14xprotozoa (log10 cells/ml) with 28 experiments (91 treatments), residual mean square error=1.94 and adjusted R 2=0.90. The proportion of butyrate in the rumen positively influenced the least square means of this relationship.},

	abstract = {AIM OF THE REVIEW: Animal models are essential in advancing resuscitation research but are susceptible to various biases compromising internal validity, which may explain unsuccessful transition to human clinical trials. This study aimed to assess risk of bias in animal studies of cardiac arrest. DATA SOURCES: This study was based on a previous systematic review of all animal cardiac arrest studies published between March 8, 2011 and March 8, 2016 in PubMed and EMBASE. For this study, we focused on interventional studies and selected a random sample of 50 pig and 50 rat studies. We used a modified version of the SYRCLE's risk of bias tool for animal studies. Bias assessment was performed by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: 92\% of pig studies and 88\% of rat studies used randomization to assign interventions, but the methodology was unknown or insufficiently reported in 60\% and 68\% of the studies, respectively. Correct timing of randomization was lacking or unclear in over half of the studies. 40\% of pig studies and 28\% of rat studies reported insufficient baseline characteristics. When possible, blinding was not performed/reported in 68\% of rat studies and 31\% of pig studies. Blinding of outcome assessors was missing or inadequately reported in 65\% of pig studies and 60\% of rat studies. 80\% of all studies lacked a sample size calculation, while 60\% of pig and 80\% of rat studies omitted a specified primary outcome. CONCLUSION: This study indicates insufficient reporting and methodological shortcomings in animal models of cardiac arrest.},

Although many studies have indicated or shown that environmental contamination with Toxocara species eggs is a major risk factor for toxocariasis in humans, there has been no comprehensive analysis of published data or information. Here, we conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis of current literature to assess the global prevalence of Toxocara eggs in public places (including beaches, parks and playgrounds). We conducted searches of the PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Science Direct databases for relevant studies published until 20 April 2018, and assessed the prevalence rates of Toxocara eggs in public places. We used the random effects model to calculate pooled prevalence estimates, with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), and analysed data in relation to WHO geographical regions. Subgroup analysis and meta-regressions regarding the geographical and environmental variables were also performed. Of 2384 publications identified, 109 studies that tested 42,797 soil samples in 40 countries were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled global prevalence of Toxocara eggs in public places was 21\% (95\% CI, 16-27\%; 13,895/42,797). The estimated prevalence rates in the different WHO regions ranged from 13\% to 35\%: Western Pacific (35\%; 95\% CI, 15-58\%), Africa (27\%; 95\% CI, 11-47\%), South America (25\%; 95\% CI, 13-33\%), South-East Asia (21\%; 95\% CI, 3-49\%), Middle East and North Africa (18\%; 95\% CI, 11-24\%), Europe (18\%; 95\% CI, 14-22\%), and North and Central Americas (13\%; 95\% CI, 8-23\%). A high prevalence was significantly associated with high geographical longitude (P = 0.04), low latitude (P = 0.02) and high relative environmental humidity (P = 0.04). This meta-analysis of data from published records indicates that public places are often heavily contaminated with eggs of Toxocara. This finding calls for measures to reduce the potential risk of infection and disease in humans.},

In recent years, consume fishes and shrimps has increased in Iran, and several study about heavy metals content in fishes and shrimps from Persian Gulf were carried out to check their food safety. The aims of these systematic reviews and meta-analysis was to summarize the evidence on the relation of the intakes of Arsenic (As) and lead (Pb) levels, based on the origin and sub-groups of shrimp species consumed, Hence that we can estimate the risk of oral cancer induced by Pb and As in these groups of shrimp from the persian gulf. We carried out a search of all suitable studies published between 1995 and 2017 in Scopus, Science Direct, PubMed and Web of Science databases. Since the heterogeneity among studied was significant, we used the random effect model (REM) to perform meta-analysis of data. Data were obtained from 9 articles (14 studies), with 511 samples, and it was reported that pooled levels of As and Pb in the muscle shrimps were 1.37 (95\% CI: 0.66-2.08 mg/kg d.w.) and 0.58 (95\% CI: 0.33-0.82 mg/kg d.w.), respectively. This pooled levels in muscle shrimps were higher than safe dose reported on Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization guidelines (FAO/WHO). The rank order of shrimps species based on As was Panulirus homarus {\textgreater} Penaeus semisulcatus and for the Pb levels was Litopenaeus vannamei {\textgreater} Panulirus homarus {\textgreater} Fenneropenaeus indicus {\textgreater} Metapenaeus affinis. The lowest and highest risk levels of oral cancer, divided by consumers age groups, were respectively 45-54 (6.94E-04) and 15-24 (8.42E-04) for the Pb, and 45-54 (2.87E-01) and 15-24 (3.51E-01) for arsenic.

The pooled concentration of PHEs in fillet trout fishes was meta-analyzed using a random-effect model (REM) and following the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks was calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method. The meta-analysis of 42 articles (43 data report) revealed that a sort of PHEs in fillet trout was 19,996.64 μg/kg ww for Fe; 1834.75 μg/kg ww for Co; 772.21 μg/kg ww for Cu; 335.78 μg/kg ww for Ni; 290.46 μg/kg ww for Se; 226.20for Cr; 178.11 μg/kg ww for Pb; 77.40 μg/kg ww for Hg; 19.40 μg/kg ww for Cd; and 3.66 μg/kg ww for inorganic As. The non-carcinogenic risk assessment indicated that the lowest and highest hazard index (HI) in the adults was Pakistan (0.0012) and Turkey (0.2388), respectively, and in children was Pakistan (0.0057) and Turkey (1.114), respectively. The non-carcinogenic risk was acceptable for adult consumers in all countries (HI {\textgreater} 1 value) but non-carcinogenic risk for children was not acceptable in Turkey. The sort of countries based on carcinogenic risk in the adults due to inorganic As was China (1.44E-06) {\textgreater} Iran (9.14E-08) {\textgreater} Turkey (4.45E-08) {\textgreater} Portugal (9.04E-10). The carcinogenic risk was threshold for adult consumers in China (CR {\textless} 10(-6)). Consumption of fillet trout (rainbow and brown) content of PHEs in many countries cannot endanger the health of consumers.},

Toxicological assays using zebrafish embryos are an advantageous technique because they are transparent, have rapid embryonic development, and do not require invasive techniques. This paper comprehensively reviews how toxicity testing with plant products is conducted in zebrafish embryos. The search terms zebra fish, Danio rerio, zebrafish, zebra danio, Brachydanio rerio, zebrafish, and embryos were used to search for English-language articles in PUBMED, SCOPUS, and WEB OF SCIENCE. Twelve articles on plant product toxicity studies using zebrafish were selected for reading and analysis. After analyzing the articles and comparing with results in mammals, it was possible to prove the similarity among the results and thus corroborate the further development of zebrafish as a valid tool in toxicity tests.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Simple obesity has become a global risk to health of human beings. Acupuncture, as one of traditional Chinese medicine therapies, has been widely used in obesity treatment in recent years. However, the individual heterogeneity which makes acupuncture's efficiency unstable leads to some controversy. So more evidence-based results are necessary to judge the effectiveness of acupuncture in treatment of simple obesity. Compared with clinical trials, animal experiments are controllable, and the underlying mechanism is more likely to be explored. Last but not the least, more and more experimental studies on acupuncture for animal obesity have been published. Therefore, we conducted the systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating simple obesity in animal experiments. METHODS: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) on acupuncture for simple obesity animal models were searched from six databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, CNKI, VIP, WanFang Date, and CMB from inception to February 2017 and updated on April 12, 2019. RevMan 5.3 software was used for meta-analysis. Treatment effects were summarized as relative risk (RR) and Standard mean difference (SMD) with 95\% of confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 108 trials involving 5731 rats were included. Meta-analysis showed that acupuncture had better effect on reducing weight (SMD -2.60, 95\%CI: -2.93 to -2.26, p{\textless}0.00001) and Lee's index (SMD -2.62, 95\%CI:-3.18 to -2.06, p{\textless}0.00001) compared with control group. However, the methodological quality of included studies was generally poor. Details of blinding were not reported in most studies. In spite of high heterogeneity being observed on the merged data, sensitivity analysis using the leave-one-out approach, subgroup analysis based on different acupuncture techniques, and rat strains and meta-regression all failed to find the sources of heterogeneity. The asymmetric funnel plot suggested publication bias. Besides, adverse events were not reported in any reports. CONCLUSIONS: Our review provided positive evidence of acupuncture for simple obesity. Unfortunately, none of the firm conclusions can be drawn due to methodological flaws, high heterogeneity, and publication bias. More high-quality trials are needed in future to get objective conclusions.},

A computerized literature search of electronic databases (PubMed and CAB abstracts) was performed along with hand searches of library resources for relevant papers, books, abstracts and conference proceedings. A random-effect model was employed to calculate pooled seroprevalence estimates with 95\% confidence intervals, and I(2) statistic was used to assess heterogeneity. Further, moderator analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of geographical area on the seroprevalence in roe deer. From a total of 190 studies initially identified, 16 and 8 articles were included for roe deer and red deer, respectively. These comprise 3,913 roe deer and 2,913 red deer from different European countries. The pooled seroprevalence was estimated to be 29\% (95\% CI: 23\%-35\%) in roe deer and 15\% (95\% CI: 10\%-20\%) in red deer. High heterogeneity was detected in the seroprevalence data within each species. In roe deer, the pooled seroprevalence estimate was significantly different according to geographical area with 40\% (95\% CI: 31\%-49\%) in Western Europe, 31\% (95\% CI: 21\%-43\%) in Northern Europe, 27\% (95\% CI: 15\%-41\%) in Eastern Europe and 21\% (95\% CI: 14\%-28\%) in Southern Europe. The present study indicates a moderate exposure to T. gondii in roe deer and red deer in Europe, with very high prevalence in Western Europe. Our results highlight the significant risk associated to the consumption of venison, encouraging proper handling and cooking of game meat to prevent toxoplasmosis in humans.},

We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and Proquest for entries no later than March 2018, and restricted the search to publications on serotonergic agents used for the treatment of LIDs in hemiparkinsonian rats. The initial search yielded 447 citations, of which 49 articles and one conference paper met our inclusion criteria. The results revealed ten different categories of serotonergic agents, including but not limited to 5-HT(1A/B)R agonists, 5-HT(2A)R antagonists, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), all of which improved LIDs without imposing considerable adverse effects. Although there is promising evidence regarding the role of these agents in relieving LIDs in hemiparkinsonian rats, further studies are needed for the enlightenment of hidden aspect of these molecules in terms of mechanisms and outcomes. Given this, improving the quality of the pre-clinical studies and designing appropriate clinical trials will help fill the bench-to-bedside gap.},

	abstract = {To tackle antimicrobial resistance, it is vital that farmers' and veterinarians' antimicrobial use behaviors and attitudes toward resistance are understood so that we can identify how beliefs and motives influence practices. Current literature details qualitative and quantitative research that explores the knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of dairy farmers and veterinarians with respect to antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial practices, and the reported findings are varied and conflicting. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review to assess the evidence and knowledge gaps in the published literature. We identified articles via database searches of Embase, Medline, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science; we limited findings to published articles available in English with no publication year restrictions. Article screening was conducted at 3 levels: title, abstract, and full text. Of the 349 articles identified, 35 were retained for systematic review. Transparency of reporting was assessed for each study using the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) framework. Quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme qualitative checklist. Findings relating to dairy farmers' and veterinarians' knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions on antimicrobial resistance and practices were thematically analyzed. The comprehensiveness of reporting was variable: studies reported 5 to 26 of the 32 COREQ checklist items. Five key themes emerged from the data: knowledge and awareness of antimicrobial resistance; factors influencing farmer and veterinarian decision-making; perceived barriers and facilitators to reduced antimicrobial use; perceived responsibility for antimicrobial resistance; and the role of the farmer and veterinarian relationship in reducing antimicrobial use. Awareness of prudent antimicrobial use was not uniform between studies. Many factors influence farmers' and veterinarians' decisions to use antimicrobials, including animal welfare and available resources. The farmer-veterinarian relationship is a potential barrier or facilitator of reduced antimicrobial use, depending on the perceived relationship dynamic. Encouraging collaboration between farmers and veterinarians could lead to shared responsibility for reducing antimicrobial use. This review provided a coherent picture of what is currently known and identified gaps in the current knowledge to inform future behavioral intervention research. Increased knowledge, skill development, resources, engagement, and further research to address the gaps we identified are the main recommendations to effectively overcome barriers, elicit appropriate behavior change, and achieve reduced antimicrobial use in dairy cattle.},

Treatment with therapeutic hypothermia reduced adverse outcomes from 60 to 45\%. Additional strategies are urgently needed to further improve the outcome for these neonates. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is a potential neuroprotective target. This article reviews the evidence of neuroprotection by nitric oxide (NO) synthesis inhibition in animal models. METHODS: Literature search using the EMBASE, Medline, Cochrane, and PubMed databases. Studies comparing NOS inhibition to placebo, with neuroprotective outcome measures, in relevant animal models were included. Methodologic quality of the included studies was assessed. RESULTS: 26 studies were included using non-selective or selective NOS inhibition in rat, piglet, sheep, or rabbit animal models. A large variety in outcome measures was reported. Outcome measures were grouped as histological, biological, or neurobehavioral. Both non-selective and selective inhibitors show neuroprotective properties in one or more outcome measures. Methodologic quality was either low or moderate for all studies. CONCLUSION: Inhibition of NO synthesis is a promising strategy for additional neuroprotection. In humans, intervention can only take place after the onset of the hypoxic-ischemic event. Therefore, combined inhibition of neuronal and inducible NOS seems the most likely candidate for human clinical trials. Future studies should determine its safety and effectiveness in neonates, as well as a potential sex-specific neuroprotective effect. Researchers should strive to improve methodologic quality of animal intervention studies by using a systematic approach in conducting and reporting of these studies.},

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL and EMBASE were searched up to January 2019 for animal experiments and human trials evaluating the pulpal transplantation of stem/progenitor cells. Cross-referencing and hand search were additionally performed. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Based on randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs), conducted in animals or humans, the effect of the transplantation of stem/progenitor cells compared to no transplantation on pulpal tissue regeneration, pulpal vitality and apical healing was examined. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: The primary outcome was histologically determined pulpal tissue regeneration, whilst pulpal vitality and apical healing were secondary outcomes. The SYstematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) guidelines and the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2.0) were used for risk-of-bias assessment. Pooled standardized differences in means (SDM) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) were calculated using random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: From 2834 identified articles, eight animal experiments (82 animals with 336 experimental pulpal defects) and one human trial (40 humans with 40 pulpal defects) were included. Risk of bias of most animal studies was high, whilst the human trial revealed 'some concerns'. Stem/progenitor cell-transplanted pulps demonstrated significantly increased pulpal tissue regeneration compared with controls (SDM [95\%CI]: 6.29 [3.78-8.80]). LIMITATIONS: Data on pulpal vitality and apical healing were sparse and inconsistent. Heterogeneity across studies was substantial, publication bias was present, and mainly indirect, surrogate outcome measures were applied. The overall strength of evidence was very low. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: The transplanation of stem/progenitor cells shows promise for pulp regeneration, whilst clinical routine application is still not in reach. Further investigations, employing a comprehensive set of outcomes including those demonstrating functional pulp regeneration relevant for patient-centred care, are required.},

Unfortunately, the aneural property of cartilage limits its regenerative potential which can be achieved using tissue engineering approach. A lot of research has been published searching for the optimization of silk fibroin (SF) and its blends in order to get the best cartilage mimicking properties. However, according to our best knowledge, there is no systematic review available regarding the use of Bombyx mori derived biomaterials limited to cartilage related studies. This systematic review highlights the in vitro and in vivo work done for the past 7 years on structural and functional properties of B. mori derived biomaterials together with different parameters for cartilage regeneration. PubMed database was searched focusing on in vitro and in vivo studies using the search thread "silk fibroin" and "cartilage". A total of 40 articles met the inclusion criteria. All the articles were deeply studied for cell types, scaffold types and animal models used along with study design and results. Five types of cells were used for in vitro while seven types of cells were used for in vivo studies. Three types of animal models were used for scaffold implantation purpose. Moreover, different types of scaffolds either seeded with cells or supplemented with various factors were explored and discussed in detail. Results suggest the suitability of silk as a better biomaterial because of its cartilage mimicking properties.},

The extensive use of honey around the globe helps researchers to study the usefulness of honey. Many studies had already been conducted and proved the effectiveness of honey in treating gastric ulcer. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify relevant studies on honey used as an alternative treatment of gastric ulcer cause by NSAIDs. A comprehensive search was conducted in Medline, SCOPUS, and Ebscohost. The main criteria used were articles published in English and using NSAIDs-induced gastric ulcer in rat's model and those reporting the effectiveness of honey. RESULTS: Articles published between 2001 and 2014 were identified to be relevant in studies related to the inclusion criteria. The literature search found 30 potential and closely related articles in this review, but only 5 articles were taken which meet the criteria needed to be fulfilled. CONCLUSIONS: All studies in this review reported the efficacy of honey for gastric ulcer based on its antioxidant and cytoprotective activities. Most of the studies conducted used different types of honey at various doses on rats. Future studies should be conducted to identify the appropriate dose for humans to achieve similar gastroprotective effects.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Tube thoracostomy is frequently used in thoracic trauma patients. However, there is no consensus on whether low pressure suction or water seal is the optimal method of tube management. Against this background, we performed a systematic review of studies comparing suction and water seal management of chest tubes placed for traumatic chest injuries in adults. Evaluated outcomes are duration of chest tube treatment, length of stay in hospital, incidence of persistent air leak, clotted hemothorax, and the need for (re-)interventions. METHODS: A systematic literature search according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines was performed. Included studies were evaluated according to the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias, and according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines for assessing the quality of evidence. RESULTS: After assessment of 120 identified studies, three RCT's (randomized controlled trials) were included in this review and meta-analysis. A favorable effect of suction was found for duration of chest tube treatment [MD (mean difference) - 3.38 days, P = 0.005], length of stay in hospital (MD -3.90 days, P = 0.0003), and the incidence of persistent air leak [OR (odds ratio) 0.27, P = 0.001]. No significant difference was found for the incidence of clotted hemothorax and (re-)interventions. The quality of evidence according to GRADE was low, except for persistent air leak (moderate). CONCLUSIONS: Suction seems to have a positive effect on duration of chest tube treatment, length of stay in hospital and persistent air leakage in chest trauma. However, available data was limited and the quality of evidence was (very) low to moderate according to GRADE.},

We systematically reviewed the effects of animal-assisted therapy (AAT) on pain, anxiety, depression, stress, blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR) in hospitalized children and teenagers. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using the English-language electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Clinical Trials, Science Direct, EBSCOhost, Open Grey and Google Scholar, and the Chinese databases CNKI, Sinomed, Vip, and WanFang. These databases were searched through July 15, 2020. SAMPLE: Eight studies, including four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and four quasi-experimental studies were included, with a total of 348 participants. RESULTS: Hospitalized children and teenagers with AAT had less pain (standardized mean difference = -0.49; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -0.77 to -0.22; P {\textless} 0.001), lower systolic blood pressure (mean difference [MD] = -4.85; 95\% CI, -9.50 to -0.21; P(=) 0.04), higher diastolic blood pressure (MD = 4.95; 95\% CI, 1.90 to 8.00; P(= 0.001)) than controls, while there was no significant difference in depression, anxiety, stress, or HR. CONCLUSION: As an adjuvant to traditional treatment, AAT was beneficial for controlling pain and BP in hospitalized children and teenagers. IMPLICATION: AAT may be an effective strategy for relieving pain and controlling BP in hospitalized children and teenagers, especially those with cancer. High-quality RCTs conducted or supported by nurses on the effects of AAT are needed.},

Titles and abstracts were screened by two of the authors independently. A total of 22 studies was included in the analysis. The definition of GOR implied the presence of fluids not reaching the mouth or nose in the oesophagus in all studies. Most studies considered a change in pH using oesophageal pH meters as the sole method of assessment. Calibration of the pH probe was inconsistently reported. The position of the tip of the oesophageal probe was inconsistent and not always precisely described. The correct positioning in the intended location was verified in a limited number of studies. Some studies considered that GOR had happened for changes in pH below 4.0 or above 7.5 while others considered that GOR had happened when the pH dropped below 4.0 only. Some studies stated that the pH change had to be sustained for a minimum period of time (20 or 30 s) whereas others did not mention any duration. The variability of definitions and methods of assessment of GOR in anaesthetized dogs precludes meaningful comparison of the findings. Re-evaluation and uniformization of the methods appear necessary.},

	abstract = {Wind energy is a key component of climate action strategies aimed at reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Despite providing environmental benefits, there are increasing concerns surrounding the impact of wind farms on wildlife, with research indicating that effects on wildlife can be highly variable between species, regions, and sites. In light of this variability and the accelerating growth of the wind energy sector globally, a comprehensive understanding of wind farm effects on wildlife and ease of access to this knowledge are pivotal to inform best practice if wind energy is to become a truly sustainable source of energy. This review evaluates interactions between a globally distributed bird genus (harriers, Circus sp.) and wind farms to assess broader patterns in wildlife-wind energy knowledge accessibility and bias. A systematic review of grey and peer-reviewed literature across two multidisciplinary and two field-specific databases in two languages (English and Spanish) yielded 235 relevant sources, covering 12 harrier species and 31 countries. Findings indicate that harriers are considered to have high sensitivity to wind farms, with greatest impacts expected from habitat effects rather than from turbine collisions. In the broader wildlife-wind energy context, this study underscores (i) the predominance of grey literature and of sources solely documenting species-wind farm overlaps; (ii) limitations in grey literature availability and peer-reviewed publication accessibility; (iii) lack of standardized research and monitoring practices; and (iv) evidence of language, taxonomic, and geographic bias in literature sources. Overall, findings demonstrate that limited accessibility to wildlife-wind energy knowledge risks widening the research-implementation gap. Widespread implementation of open practices that allow researchers and practitioners to build on existing knowledge (e.g. national and international online repositories and databases, knowledge sharing and collaborative initiatives, open access publications) is crucial if ongoing wind energy development efforts are to be successfully aligned with conservation priorities.},

However, the scientific evidence for their use is still controversial. The purpose of this review was to critically elucidate the efficacy of these nutraceutical therapies in delaying the progression of osteoarthritis, evaluating their impact on the synovial knee joint tissues and biochemical markers in preclinical studies by systematically reviewing the last two decades of peer-reviewed publications on experimental osteoarthritis. Three databases (PubMed, Scopus and, Web of Science) were screened for eligible studies. Twenty-two articles were included in the review. Preclinical studies showed a great heterogeneity among the experimental designs and their outcomes. Generally, the evaluated nutraceuticals, alone or in combination, did not seem to prevent the subchondral bone changes, the synovial inflammation or the osteophyte formation. However, further experimental studies may be needed to evaluate their effect at those levels. Regarding the cartilage status and biomarkers, positive responses were identified in approximately half of the evaluated articles. Furthermore, beneficial effects were associated with the pre-emptive administrations, higher doses and, multimodality approaches with some combined therapies. However, additional studies in the long term and with good quality and systematic design are required.},

Its beneficial activities have been demonstrated in different human pathologies, including hepatoprotective effects against liver disorders. High mortality and late diagnosis of the primary liver tumor hepatocarcinoma (HCC) makes this cancer an interesting target for the study of quercetin effects. Our aim was to systematically review antitumor activities of quercetin in HCC preclinical studies employing single, encapsulated, combined or derived quercetin forms. Literature search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science (WOS), and 39 studies were finally included. We found that 17 articles evaluated quercetin effects alone, six used encapsulated strategy, 10 combined this flavonoid, two decided to co-encapsulate it and only four studied effects of quercetin derivatives, highlighting that only nine included in vivo models. Results evidence the quercetin antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties against HCC either alone and with the mentioned strategies; nevertheless, few investigations assessed specific activities on different processes related with cancer progression. Overall, further studies including animal models are needed to deeper investigate the precise mechanisms of action of quercetin as antitumor agent, as well as the potential of novel strategies aimed to improve quercetin effects in HCC.},

	abstract = {Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRD) is a worldwide multifactorial infectious disease. Antimicrobials are commonly used for treating BRD because bacteria are often involved. The clinical diagnosis of BRD is a challenge, especially in adult dairy cows, where information on this syndrome is scant. Having a definition based on consistent and reliable clinical signs would improve the accuracy of BRD diagnosis and could help to develop an optimal treatment approach by an early detection. The aim of this scoping review was to review clinical signs that could be recognized by producers in dairy cattle suffering from naturally occurring infectious respiratory disease, as reported in the literature. A review of the literature was performed for articles published between January 1, 1990 and January 1, 2020. The search of literature in English, French, and Italian languages included 2 different databases (Pubmed, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/; CAB abstract, https://www.cabi.org/publishing-products/cab-abstracts/). Clinical signs were categorized as follows: (1) "general manifestations of disease," which included behavioral changes or fever; (2) "alterations in respiratory function," which included clinical signs specifically associated with the respiratory tract examination; and (3) "clinical signs of other body systems," which included clinical signs related to other systems such as diarrhea or subcutaneous emphysema. The focus of the review was on clinical signs that could be monitored by animal handlers and producers. A total of 1,067 titles were screened, and 23 studies were finally included. The most common general clinical signs were increased body temperature (reported in 83\% of studies, n = 19), change in feed intake (26\%, n = 6), altered mentation (22\%, n = 5), and decreased milk production (17\%, n = 4). The alterations in respiratory function noted were nasal discharge (74\%, n = 17), cough (65\%, n = 15), altered respiratory dynamic or dyspnea (61\%, n = 14), increased respiratory rate (43\%, n = 10), and ocular discharge or lacrimation (30\%, n = 7). The clinical signs associated with infectious respiratory disease reported in the 23 studies generally lacked a clear description of what constitutes a deviation from normality (0-50\% of studies clearly reported what was considered normal versus abnormal depending on the clinical signs). This limitation prevented any comparison between studies that apparently reported the same "clinical sign," but possibly referred to a different assessment and definition of what was considered normal versus abnormal. Therefore, the definition of clinical signs in a repeatable way with validated interobserver agreement to determine the optimal combination for the diagnosis of BRD in dairy cows is needed. This could lead to a more judicious use of antimicrobials for respiratory disease in adult dairy cows.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a severe and progressive disease of pulmonary arterioles. This pathology is characterized by elevation of the pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure, leading to right heart failure and death. Studies have demonstrated that resveratrol possesses a protective effect on the mechanisms related to the genesis of the PAH-induced by different models. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the dose-related effects of resveratrol in different models of pulmonary arterial hypertension. METHODS: To identify eligible papers, we performed a systematic literature search on Scielo, Pub- Med, and Scholar Google. The research was limited to articles written in English in the last 10 years. We used the following descriptors to search: Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and Resveratrol, OR Resveratrol, and Animal models of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, OR Resveratrol, and in vitro models of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. RESULTS: 1724 studies were identified through the descriptors used, fifty-five studies with different models of pulmonary arterial hypertension were selected for the full review, forty-four were excluded after application of exclusion and inclusion criteria, totalizing eleven studies included in this systematic review. CONCLUSION: The results showed that resveratrol, at low and high doses, protects in a dosedependent manner against the development of PAH induced through monocrotaline, normoxia and hypoxia models. In addition to having chemopreventive, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiproliferative properties. In the case of PAH-related myocardial injury, resveratrol protects cells from apoptosis, thus working as an antiapoptotic agent.},

However, it is not known whether these models are also comparable regarding drug response in quantitative terms (effect size). To investigate the extent of these differences, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of approved drugs in these models. We searched on PubMed and Embase on July 3, 2019 for studies including either model, a monotherapy arm with an EMA/FDA approved drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, HbA1c assessment and a control group. Studies aimed at diabetes prevention or with surgical interventions were excluded. We calculated the Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) to compare effect sizes (HbA1c reduction) per drug and drug class across models. We included a risk of bias assessment for all included publications. A total of 121 publications met our inclusion criteria. For drugs with more than two comparisons, both models predicted the direction of the effect regarding HbA1c levels. There were no differences between the db/db mouse and ZDF rat, except for exenatide (P = 0.02) and GLP-1 agonists (P = 0.03) in which a larger effect size was calculated in the ZDF rat. Our results indicate the differences between the db/db mouse and ZDF rat are not relevant for preliminary efficacy testing. This methodology can be used to further differentiate between animal models used for the same indication, facilitating the selection of models more likely to predict human response.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Clinicians utilize lipid emulsion to treat local anesthetic toxicity and non-local anesthetic toxicities, a practice supported by animal experimentation and clinical experience. Prior meta-analysis confirmed a mortality benefit of lipid emulsion in animal models of local anesthetic toxicity but the benefit of lipid emulsion in models of non-local anesthetic toxicity remains unanswered. Further, swine suffer an anaphylactoid reaction from lipid emulsions calling into question their role as a model system to study lipid, so we examined swine and non-swine dependent outcomes in models of intravenous lipid emulsion. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the use of lipid emulsion therapy in animal models of cardiac toxicity. We quantified mortality using a random-effects odds-ratio method. Secondary outcomes included survival in the following subgroups: local-anesthetic systemic toxicity, non-local anesthetic toxicity, swine-based models, and non-swine models (e.g., rat, rabbit and dog). We assessed for heterogeneity with Cochran's Q and I(2). We examined bias with Egger's test \& funnel plot analysis. RESULTS: Of 2784 references screened, 58 met criteria for inclusion. Treatment with lipid emulsion reduced chance of death in all models of toxicity with an odds ratio of death of 0.26 (95\% CI 0.16-0.44, Z-5.21, p {\textless} 0.00001, Cohen's-d = 0.72, n = 60). Secondary outcomes confirmed a reduced chance of death in models of local anesthetic toxicity (OR 0.16 \{95\% CI 0.1-0.33\}) and non-local anesthetic toxicity (OR 0.43 \{95\% CI 0.22-0.83\}). Heterogeneity (Cochran's Q 132 \{df = 59, p {\textless} 0.01\}, I (2) = 0.55) arose primarily from animal-model and disappeared (I (2) {\textless} = 0.12) when we analyzed swine and non-swine subgroups independently. Swine only benefited in models of local anesthetic toxicity (OR 0.28 \{95\% CI 0.11-0.7\}, p = 0.0033) whereas non-swine models experienced a homogeneous benefit across all toxins (OR 0.1 \{95\% CI 0.06-0.16\}, p {\textless} 0.00001). Egger's test identified risk of bias with outliers on funnel plot analysis. DISCUSSION: Lipid emulsion therapy reduces mortality in animal models of toxicity. Heterogeneity arises from the animal-model used. Swine only benefit in models of local anesthetic toxicity, potentially due to lipid dose, experimental design or swine's anaphylactoid reaction to lipid. Outlier analysis reinforced the need for appropriate dosing of lipid emulsion along with airway management and chest compressions in the setting of cardiac arrest.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) has become a widely used technique for the rapid and accurate identification of bacteria, mycobacteria and certain fungal pathogens in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Thus far, only few attempts have been made to apply the technique in clinical parasitology, particularly regarding helminth identification. METHODS: We systematically reviewed the scientific literature on studies pertaining to MALDI-TOF MS as a diagnostic technique for helminths (cestodes, nematodes and trematodes) of medical and veterinary importance. Readily available electronic databases (i.e. PubMed/MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Google Scholar) were searched from inception to 10 October 2018, without restriction on year of publication or language. The titles and abstracts of studies were screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers. Relevant articles were read in full and included in the systematic review. RESULTS: A total of 84 peer-reviewed articles were considered for the final analysis. Most papers reported on the application of MALDI-TOF for the study of Caenorhabditis elegans, and the technique was primarily used for identification of specific proteins rather than entire pathogens. Since 2015, a small number of studies documented the successful use of MALDI-TOF MS for species-specific identification of nematodes of human and veterinary importance, such as Trichinella spp. and Dirofilaria spp. However, the quality of available data and the number of examined helminth samples was low. CONCLUSIONS: Data on the use of MALDI-TOF MS for the diagnosis of helminths are scarce, but recent evidence suggests a potential role for a reliable identification of nematodes. Future research should explore the diagnostic accuracy of MALDI-TOF MS for identification of (i) adult helminths, larvae and eggs shed in faecal samples; and (ii) helminth-related proteins that are detectable in serum or body fluids of infected individuals.},

With a high mutation rate and frequent recombination, enteroviruses are noted to evolve and change over time. Given the evidence that human enteroviruses are commonly found in other mammalian species and that some human and animal enteroviruses are genetically similar, it is possible that enzootic enteroviruses may also be infecting human populations. We conducted a systematic review of the English and Chinese literature published between 2007 and 2017 to examine evidence that enteroviruses may be zoonotic. Of the 2704 articles screened for inclusion, 16 articles were included in the final review. The review of these articles yielded considerable molecular evidence of zooanthroponosis transmission, particularly among non-human primates. While there were more limited instances of anthropozoonosis transmission, the available data support the biological plausibility of cross-species transmission and the need to conduct periodic surveillance at the human-animal interface.},

	abstract = {The skin and its microbiota serve as physical barriers to prevent invasion of pathogens. Skin damage can be a consequence of illness, surgery, and burns. The most effective wound management strategy is to prevent infections, promote healing, and prevent excess scarring. It is well established that probiotics can aid in skin healing by stimulating the production of immune cells, and they also exhibit antagonistic effects against pathogens via competitive exclusion of pathogens. Our aim was to conduct a review of recent literature on the efficacy of using probiotics against pathogens that cause wound infections. In this integrative review, we searched through the literature published in the international following databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and Scopus using the search terms "probiotic" AND "wound infection." During a comprehensive review and critique of the selected research, fourteen in vitro studies, 8 animal studies, and 19 clinical studies were found. Two of these in vitro studies also included animal studies, yielding a total of 39 articles for inclusion in the review. The most commonly used probiotics for all studies were well-known strains of the species Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. All in vitro studies showed successful inhibition of chosen skin or wound pathogens by the selected probiotics. Within the animal studies on mice, rats, and rabbits, probiotics showed strong opportunities for counteracting wound infections. Most clinical studies showed slight or statistically significant lower incidence of surgical site infections, foot ulcer infection, or burn infections for patients using probiotics. Several of these studies also indicated a statistically significant wound healing effect for the probiotic groups. This review indicates that exogenous and oral application of probiotics has shown reduction in wound infections, especially when used as an adjuvant to antibiotic therapy, and therefore the potential use of probiotics in this field remains worthy of further studies, perhaps focused more on typical skin inhabitants as next-generation probiotics with high potential.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to blacklegged ticks Ixodes scapularis that transmit pathogens is thought to occur peri-domestically. However, the locations where people most frequently encounter infected ticks are not well characterized, leading to mixed messages from public health officials about where risk is highest. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on spatial risk factors for tick-borne disease and tick bites in eastern North America. We examined three scales: the residential yard, the neighborhood surrounding (but not including) the yard, and outside the neighborhood. Nineteen eligible studies represented 2741 cases of tick-borne illness and 1447 tick bites. Using random effects models, we derived pooled odds ratio (OR) estimates. RESULTS: The meta-analysis revealed significant disease risk factors at the scale of the yard (OR 2.60 95\% CI 1.96 - 3.46), the neighborhood (OR 4.08 95\% CI 2.49 - 6.68), and outside the neighborhood (OR 2.03 95\% CI 1.59 - 2.59). Although significant risk exists at each scale, neighborhood scale risk factors best explained disease exposure. Analysis of variance revealed risk at the neighborhood scale was 57\% greater than risk at the yard scale and 101\% greater than risk outside the neighborhood. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis emphasizes the importance of understanding and reducing tick-borne disease risk at the neighborhood scale. Risk-reducing interventions applied at each scale could be effective, but interventions applied at the neighborhood scale are most likely to protect human health.

No human vaccines are currently available, and both diagnosis and treatment are sometimes ineffectual, leading to advocacy for self-directed preventative measures. These recommendations are widely communicated to the public, but there is limited evidence for their efficacy. We undertook a systematic review and mixed-effects meta-regression analysis of factors purported to increase or decrease risk of black-legged tick bites and tick-borne disease. Published articles used in the study spanned the years 1984-2018. Variables associated with increased probability of tick-borne disease, with odds ratios significantly greater than 1, included deer abundance, high density of nymph-stage black-legged ticks, landscapes with interspersed herbaceous and forested habitat, low human population density, gardens, cat ownership, and race. Contrary to recommendations, use of landscape-related tick control measures, such as clearing brush, trimming branches, and having a dry barrier between lawn and woods, tended to increase risk. Pet ownership increased bite risk. Bite risk was highest for children aged 5 years or less, with a secondary peak in persons aged 50-70 years. Although some widely disseminated recommendations are supported by the research analyzed, others require further evaluation. Additional research is also needed to understand the mechanisms underlying significant relationships.},

METHODS: We searched PubMed, the Cochrane library, and Medline. Animal and human studies published in English were included. Broad search terms were used: dexmedetomidine or clonidine, sepsis, and inflammation. Reference lists were screened for additional publications. Titles and abstracts were screened independently by two reviewers and full-text articles obtained for potentially eligible studies. Data extraction used a bespoke template given study diversity, and quality assessment was qualitative. RESULTS: Study diversity meant meta-analysis was not feasible so descriptive synthesis was undertaken. We identified 30 animal studies (caecal ligation/puncture (9), lipopolysaccharide (14), acute lung injury (5), and ischaemia-reperfusion syndrome (5)), and 9 human studies. Most animal (26 dexmedetomidine, 4 clonidine) and all human studies used dexmedetomidine. In animal studies, α2 agonists reduced serum and/or tissue TNFα (20 studies), IL-6 (17 studies), IL-1β (7 studies), NFκB (6 studies), TLR4 (6 studies), and a range of other mediators. Timing and doses varied widely, but in many cases were not directly relevant to human sedation use. In human studies, dexmedetomidine reduced CRP (4 studies), TNFα (5 studies), IL-6 (6 studies), IL-1β (3 studies), and altered several other mediators. Most studies were small and low quality. No studies related effects to clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: Evidence supports potential anti-inflammatory effects from α2 agonists, but the relevance to clinically important outcomes is uncertain. Further work should explore whether dose relationships with inflammation and clinical outcomes are present which might be separate from sedation-mediated effects.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Component-resolved diagnostics (CRD) are promising tools for diagnosing food allergy, offering the potential to determine specific phenotypes and to develop patient-tailored risk profiles. Nevertheless, the diagnostic accuracy of these tests varies across studies; thus, their clinical utility remains unclear. Therefore, we synthesized the evidence from studies investigating the diagnostic accuracy, risk assessment ability, and cost-effectiveness of CRD for food allergy. METHODS: We systematically searched 10 electronic databases and four clinical trial registries for studies published from January 2000 to February 2017. The quality of included studies was assessed using QUADAS-2. Due to heterogeneity, we narratively synthesized the evidence. RESULTS: Eleven studies met inclusion criteria, altogether recruiting 1098 participants. The food allergies investigated were cow's milk, hen's egg, peanut, hazelnut, and shrimp. The components with the highest diagnostic accuracy for each allergen, along with their sensitivity-specificity pairs, were as follows: Bos d 4 for cow's milk (62.0\% and 87.5\%), Gal d 1 for hen's egg (84.2\% and 89.8\% for heated egg, and 60.6\% and 97.1\% for raw egg), Ara h 6 for peanut (94.9\% and 95.1\%), Cor a 14 for hazelnut (100\% and 93.8\%), and Lit v 1 for shrimp (82.8\% and 56.3\%) allergy. CONCLUSION: Selected components of cow's milk, hen's egg, peanut, hazelnut, and shrimp allergen showed high specificity, but lower sensitivity. However, few studies exist for each component, and studies vary widely regarding the cutoff values used, making it challenging to synthesize findings across studies. Further research is needed to determine clinically appropriate cutoff values, risk assessment abilities, and cost-effectiveness of CRD approaches.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The concept of anaesthesia-related neonatal neurotoxicity originated in neonatal rodent models, yet prospective clinical studies have largely not supported this concern. OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency and magnitude of hypercarbia, hypoxia and death in rodent models of neonatal anaesthetic toxicity and neurodevelopmental delay. DESIGN: Systematic review of published rodent studies of neonatal anaesthesia neurotoxicity. We documented anaesthetic, route, dose, frequency and duration of exposures. We further report ventilation method, documentation of adequacy of ventilation [arterial blood gas (ABG), other], mortality and the reporting of mortality. DATA SOURCES: A PubMed literature search from 2003 to 2017 was conducted to identify studies on neurotoxicity in neonatal rodent models. ELIGIBILITY: Studies were included when at least one group of animals fell within the postnatal age range of 3 to 15 days. Only English language original studies published as full-length articles in peer reviewed journals were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: One hundred and three manuscripts were included. Ninety-eight percent of studies were conducted using spontaneous ventilation (101/103), with ABG monitoring used in only 33\% of studies and visual monitoring alone for respiratory distress or cyanosis was employed in 60\%. Of the 33\% who reported ABG results, there were widely divergent values, with most reporting modest-to-severe hypercarbia. Mortality (median 11\%, range of 0 to 40\%), which infers severe hypoxia, was documented in only 36/103 (35\%) reports. CONCLUSION: Hypoxia and hypercarbia have known apoptotic effects on developing brains. Hence, the inadequate control of hypercarbia and hypoxia in neonatal rodent models of anaesthetic exposure during spontaneous ventilation suggests that the evidence for developmental delay and neurotoxicity attributed to anaesthesia may not be valid in humans.},

Whilst historically many applications of sensors in sheep research have been conducted over a short period with small numbers of experimental animals, this trend appears to be changing as technology develops and access improves. The literature suggests that many applications of sensors have already or are currently moving through a proof-of-concept stage, allowing future applications to focus on commercialisation of technology and potential integration with other technologies already in use (e.g. weather data).},

The key questions posed were: To what extent can current scientific knowledge inform a sensor-based approach to welfare evaluations? And, how might this knowledge shape development of commercial monitoring systems? These questions were explored through retrospective classification of published sensor applications using The Five Domains (FD) Model as a framework for animal welfare assessment. A total of 71 studies were reviewed. The results indicate studies specifically evaluating the use of sensors for welfare assessment are limited, though many experiments could still be related to some aspect of welfare. The assessment of sensor utilisation revealed the greatest proportion of applications within the 'Behaviour' Domain (90.1\%; n=64), and the lowest within the 'Health' (25.4\%; n=18) and 'Mental state' Domains (25.4\%; n=18). The review also highlights how different sensor types (location, motion or physiological) differ in their applicability for welfare assessment. This paper is the first to classify published sensor applications using the FD Model as a framework and highlights the potential for sensor technology in sheep welfare monitoring. The results suggest that any attempt to create a commercial sensor-based system for objective welfare assessment will require the integration of more than one sensor type, particularly if multiple Domains are to be addressed.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12931-019-1267-8},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: While porcine seems to be superior to bovine surfactants in terms of respiratory outcomes, it is unclear if a surfactant can improve extra-pulmonary outcomes in preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome and if there is any physiopathological/biological mechanism linking surfactant therapy to these outcomes. We aim to fill these knowledge gaps. METHODS: Systematic and pragmatic review coupled with meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of bovine or porcine surfactants administered to treat RDS in preterm neonates; common extra-pulmonary neonatal intensive care outcomes were considered. As additional analysis, animal or human translational studies about mechanisms linking surfactant replacement to extra-pulmonary neonatal outcomes were also systematically reviewed. RESULTS: Porcine surfactant is associated with lower incidence of patent ductus arteriosus (OR:0.655; 95\%CI:0.460-0.931); p = 0.018; 12 trials; 1472 patients); prenatal steroids (coeff.:-0.009, 95\%CI:-0.03-0.009, p = 0.323) and gestational age (coeff.:0.079, 95\%CI:-0.18-0.34, p = 0.554) did not influence this effect size. No significant differences were found between porcine and bovine surfactants on neonatal intensive care unit length of stay (mean difference (days):-2.977; 95\%CI:-6.659-0.705; p = 0.113; 8 trials; 855 patients), intra-ventricular hemorrhage of any grade (OR:0.860; 95\%CI:0.648-1.139); p = 0.293; 15 trials; 1703 patients), severe intra-ventricular hemorrhage (OR:0.852; 95\%CI:0.624-1.163); p = 0.313; 15 trials; 1672 patients), necrotizing entero-colitis (OR:1.190; 95\%CI:0.785-1.803); p = 0.412; 9 trials; 1097 patients) and retinopathy of prematurity (OR:0.801; 95\%CI:0.480-1.337); p = 0.396; 10 trials; 962 patients). CONCLUSIONS: Physiopathological mechanisms explaining the effect of surfactant have been found for patent ductus arteriosus only, while they are lacking for all other endpoints. Porcine surfactant is associated with lower incidence of PDA than bovine surfactants. As there are no differences in terms of other extra-pulmonary outcomes and no physiopathological plausibility, these endpoints should not be used in future trials.

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review. SAMPLE: English-language articles describing soft tissue and oncologic surgeries in client-owned dogs and cats published in peer-reviewed journals from 2013 to 2016. METHODS: CAB, AGRICOLA, and MEDLINE databases were searched for eligible articles. Article characteristics relevant to complications were abstracted and summarized, including reported events, definitions, criteria used to classify events according to severity and time frame, and relevant citations. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-one articles involving 10 522 animals were included. Canine retrospective case series of dogs predominated. Ninety-two percent of articles mentioned complications in study results, but only 7.3\% defined the term complication. Articles commonly described complications according to time frame and severity, but terminology and classification criteria were highly variable, conflicting between studies, or not provided. Most (58\%) reported complications could have been graded with a published veterinary adverse event classification scheme, although common intraoperative complications were notable exceptions. CONCLUSION: Definitions and criteria used to classify and report soft tissue and oncologic surgical complications are often absent, incomplete, or contradictory among studies. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Lack of consistent terminology contributes to inadequate communication of important information about surgical complications. Standardization of terminology and consistency in severity scoring will improve comparative evaluation of clinical research results.},

	abstract = {Reduced bull fertility imposes economic losses in bovine herds. Specifically, testicular and spermatic traits are important indicators of reproductive efficiency. Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genomic regions associated with these fertility traits. The aims of this study were as follows: 1) to perform a systematic review of GWAS results for spermatic and testicular traits in cattle and 2) to identify key functional candidate genes for these traits. The identification of functional candidate genes was performed using a systems biology approach, where genes shared between traits and studies were evaluated by a guilt by association gene prioritization (GUILDify and ToppGene software) in order to identify the best functional candidates. These candidate genes were integrated and analyzed in order to identify overlapping patterns among traits and breeds. Results showed that GWAS for testicular-related traits have been developed for beef breeds only, whereas the majority of GWAS for spermatic-related traits were conducted using dairy breeds. When comparing traits measured within the same study, the highest number of genes shared between different traits was observed, indicating a high impact of the population genetic structure and environmental effects. Several chromosomal regions were enriched for functional candidate genes associated with fertility traits. Moreover, multiple functional candidate genes were enriched for markers in a species-specific basis, taurine (Bos taurus) or indicine (Bos indicus). For the different candidate regions identified in the GWAS in the literature, functional candidate genes were detected as follows: B. Taurus chromosome X (BTX) (TEX11, IRAK, CDK16, ATP7A, ATRX, HDAC6, FMR1, L1CAM, MECP2, etc.), BTA17 (TRPV4 and DYNLL1), and BTA14 (MOS, FABP5, ZFPM2). These genes are responsible for regulating important metabolic pathways or biological processes associated with fertility, such as progression of spermatogenesis, control of ciliary activity, development of Sertoli cells, DNA integrity in spermatozoa, and homeostasis of testicular cells. This study represents the first systematic review on male fertility traits in cattle using a system biology approach to identify key candidate genes for these traits.},

	abstract = {Cats are one of the world's most populous companion animals, yet little is known about how the home environment is adapted relative to their needs. Outdoor access is thought to be beneficial for both the physical and mental wellbeing of cats, yet as urbanisation increases, reducing owner access to outdoor spaces, an increasing number of cats are kept strictly indoors. The impact of an indoor lifestyle on feline behaviour and welfare is little explored and poorly understood. This study used a systematic review to assess scientifically validated knowledge concerning social and physical environments and their implications for indoor cats. A total of 61 papers were analysed. Only n=21 papers directly addressed at-home indoor scenarios with the remainder consisting of shelter/cattery (n=27) or laboratory (n=16) (some papers explored multiple environments). Across studies there was little evidence of rigour or systematically controlled approaches. Methods frequently used were cat-stress-scores (CSS) and ethograms, neither of which were consistently standardised, substantially reducing the ability to compare findings among studies. Numerous studies explored similar variables (i.e. provision of hiding space (n=9)) yielding little additional knowledge. Measures of welfare and behaviour were often assessed using single parameters in controlled environments. Although this may be useful and applicable to cat experiences within shelters, catteries and laboratories, the findings do not necessarily translate to dynamic and variable household environments. Major findings include the benefits of enrichment such as hiding boxes and vertical resting spaces, as often recommended by veterinarians and feline charities. However, other advice provided, such as the provision of feeding enrichment for psychological welfare, although not necessarily disputed, appears to be scientifically untested. Additionally, despite the social environment being likely to have a substantial effect on cat welfare, it is particularly under-studied in the home, especially in terms of its complexity (e.g. presence of young children or dogs). Overall, the review identified substantial gaps relative to cat experiences and welfare in multifactorial home environments. Understanding the impact of indoor lifestyles and promoting mechanisms to minimise any negative impacts whilst promoting positive ones, remains an important, yet underexplored, area of research.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasmosis, caused by the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, is an important disease with worldwide distribution. Infection can occur from ingesting raw or undercooked infected meat, and among food animal species, pork is known to be one of the main sources of meat-borne infection. Here, we present results of the first systematic review and meta-analysis on the global T. gondii seroprevalence in pigs. PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and EMBASE databases were comprehensively searched for relevant studies published between January 1, 1990 and October 25, 2018. We used a random effects model to calculate pooled seroprevalence estimates with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) and analyzed data from five continents. We also conducted subgroup and meta-regression analyses to evaluate the effects of geographical and climate variables on pooled seroprevalence rates. Among 1542 publications identified, 148 studies containing 150 datasets were included in the meta-analysis, and comprised 148,092 pigs from 47 countries. The pooled global T. gondii seroprevalence in pigs was estimated to be 19\% (95\%CI, 17-22\%; 23,696/148,092), with the lowest seroprevalence in Europe (13\%; 10-15\%) and highest seroprevalence in Africa (25\%; 17-34\%) and North America (25\%; 19-33\%). The seropositivity rates in Asia and South America regions were (21\%, 16-26\%) and (23\%; 17-30\%), respectively. A significantly higher T. gondii seroprevalence was associated with higher mean annual temperature and lower geographical latitude. The presence of cats on farms was identified as a potential risk factor for T. gondii seropositivity (OR, 1.41; 95\%CI, 1.00-2.02). Our findings highlight the importance of pigs as a possible source of human T. gondii infections.},

METHODS: English and French published articles indexed in EBSCOhost, PubMed, Web of Science, and African Journals Online were retrieved, with searches being conducted up to August, 2015. Data were pooled and meta-analysis performed using a random-effects model, and the results are described as event rates. RESULTS: According to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 17 articles out of the 852 retrieved were eligible for the qualitative and quantitative analysis. The studies included were mainly conducted in Nigeria, with Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Campylobacter spp. being the main bacteria. The pooled estimates showed high level of antibiotic resistance (ABR) (86\%; p {\textless} 0.001) and multidrug resistance (73\%; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ABR is substantively prevalent and poses a serious threat for food safety and security in Africa. These findings shed light on areas for future research concerning antibiotic-resistant and multidrug-resistant bacteria in food animals as etiological agents of infectious diseases in humans. They further yielded some interesting findings on the burden of ABR that could be useful in developing measures to contain this threat in the farm-to-plate continuum in Africa.},

Publication data were collected from the Web of Science for the year range 1968-2017 and by-hand pre-processing of the data was undertaken to identify reviews and original research articles on AW. VOSviewer was used to create bibliometric networks. There has been a 13.3\% annual growth in AW publications in the last 50 years with Animal Welfare and Applied Animal Behaviour Science the most frequent publishers of AW publications. Farm animals continue to dominate the subject of AW research and comparison of network visualisations for five key species suggested possible gaps in the research, such as relatively little emphasis on emotion research for some farm animals and little research on inherited disorders in dogs. However, keyword analysis indicated a recent broadening of AW findings to include other international contexts, such as conservation and sustainability. Highly cited review articles were grouped into five clusters with affective state (ie emotions, moods) and fish welfare the most recent topics. Almost all core authors of original research articles study farm animals, though in the last ten years other topics, such as consumer attitudes and wildlife, have emerged as highly cited areas of original research articles. Network analysis of organisations revealed the University of Bristol, UK as the main publisher of original research articles. Citation analysis indicated that many low-cited articles were originating from Germany and were published in German journals, suggesting that many worthwhile results and opinions on AW may be being missed by other researchers due to a language barrier. Several limitations of bibliometric analysis to generate an overview of AW science were identified, including the challenge of how to search and extract all the relevant publications in this discipline. In conclusion, animal welfare science is still in an exponential phase of growth which will bring opportunities, such as for the publication of new journals, but also challenges. The insights generated by this study suggest bibliometric analysis to be a useful addition to other approaches investigating the trends and concepts of animal welfare.},

	abstract = {Histological grading systems remain cornerstones in the prognosis of canine cutaneous mast cell tumours (MCTs), but the distinct biological behaviour of each tumour often necessitates the use of complementary markers. Although a plethora of immunohistochemical markers have been proposed as prognostic factors, few are presently applied in routine diagnosis. This systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to establish which immunohistochemical markers have verifiable prognostic value for cutaneous MCTs in dogs. A Boolean search of five databases identified 200 articles for screening, of which 73 were selected for full-text assessment and 24 ultimately included in the systematic review. Odds Ratio (OR) was adopted as the summary measure for subsequent meta-analysis but only 15 articles, relating to the immunomarkers Ki-67 (9), KIT (5), and BAX (2), provided either a value for OR or sufficient data to calculate this statistic. Meta-analysis verified that canine cutaneous MCTs with elevated expression of Ki-67 or BAX, as well aberrant immuno-expression of KIT, showed an increased odds of death, with respective OR values of 11.2 (95\% CI 6.3-20.0; p {\textless} .01), 9.9 (95\% CI 1.3-73.6; p = .03), and 4.1 (95\% CI 1.1-15.3; p = .03). Despite KIT, Ki67, and BAX arise as suitable prognostic factor for canine MCTs, this study highlighted the lack of important clinical and statistical data in many published articles, rendering it impossible to complete the meta-analysis of several potentially valuable immunohistochemical markers.},

We identified 14 studies: 8 that evaluated propofol, 5 that evaluated fentanyl, and 2 that evaluated midazolam. All studies suffered from significant limitations, including: small sample size, and heterogeneous design and measurement techniques. In general, there was no significant change seen in CBF/cerebrovascular response to administration of propofol, fentanyl, or midazolam during experiments where PCO(2) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were controlled. This review highlights the current knowledge gap surrounding the impact of commonly utilized sedative drugs in TBI care.

Healthy animals and those undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in CBF with NE administration. However, animal models and human patients with acquired brain injury had varied responses in CBF to NE administration. The animal models indicate an increase in cerebral vasoconstriction with NE administration through the alpha receptors in vessels.

Subsequent to the primary mechanical damage, progressive secondary damage further exacerbates the functional deficit. Demyelination may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SCI. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are considered a candidate cellular treatment approach for SCI attributable to their unique potential. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of OPC transplantation in rat models with traumatic thoracic SCI, and 17 studies (20 experiments, 402 rats) were identified. The Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating score, latency and amplitude of motor evoked potential (MEP), percentage of myelinated axons, and cavity size were used as outcome measurements. The pooled results of the meta-analysis in different subgroups (based on cell dose or sex) both suggested that the BBB score of the OPC group was significantly improved compared to that of the control group 2, 4, and 8 weeks after transplantation. Whereas the amplitude of MEP was not significantly different, the latency of MEP was significantly shorter compared to that of the control group 4 weeks after transplantation. The percentage of myelinated axons increased significantly in the OPC group compared to that of the control group after OPC transplantation. Area measurements across groups revealed a significant reduction in cavity size in the OPC-treated groups compared to the control group. In conclusion, OPC transplantation provided considerable beneficial effects after traumatic SCI.},

	abstract = {Background: Dingoes and wild-living dogs in Australia, which include feral domestic dogs and dingo-dog hybrids, play a role as reservoirs of disease. In the case of an exotic disease incursion-such as rabies-these reservoirs could be a threat to the health of humans, domestic animals and other wildlife in Australia. Disease spread models are needed to explore this impact and develop mitigation strategies for responding to an incursion. Our study aim was to describe relevant information from the literature, using a scoping review, on specific topics related to dingo and wild-living dog ecology and biology (topics of interest) in Australia to inform parameterisation of disease spread modelling and identify major research gaps. Methods: A broad electronic search was conducted in five bibliographic databases and grey literature. Two levels of screening and two levels of data extraction were each performed independently by two reviewers. Data extracted included topics of interest investigated, type of population sampled, the presence of lethal control, type of environment, years of collection and GPS coordinates of study sites. Results: From 1666 records captured, the screening process yielded 229 individual studies published between 1862 and 2016. The most frequently reported topics of interest in studies were index of abundance (n = 93) and diet (n = 68). Among the three key parameters in disease spread modelling (i.e., density, contacts and home range), data on density and contacts were identified as major research gaps in the literature due to the small number of recent studies on these topics and the scarcity of quantitative estimates. The research reviewed was mostly located around central Australia and the east coast, including a few studies on density, contacts and home range. Data from these regions could potentially be used to inform parameterisation for disease spread modelling of dingoes and wild-living dogs. However, the number of studies is limited in equatorial and tropical climate zones of northern Australia, which is a high-risk area for a rabies incursion. Conclusions: Research in northern regions of Australia, especially to generate data regarding density, contacts and home ranges, should be prioritised for future research on dingoes and wild-living dogs.},

The colonization of different animal reservoirs by Campylobacter poses an important risk for humans through shedding of the pathogen in livestock waste and contamination of water sources, environment, and food. A review of published articles was conducted to obtain information on the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles of thermophilic Campylobacter species in humans and animals in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Electronic databases, namely, PubMed, Google Scholar, Research4life-HINARI Health, and Researchgate.net, were searched using the following search terms "thermophilic Campylobacter," "Campylobacter jejuni," "Campylobacter coli," "diarrhea/diarrhoea," "antimicrobial resistance," "antibiotic resistance," "humans," "animals," "Sub-Saharan Africa," and "a specific country name." Initially, a total of 614 articles were identified, and the lists of references were screened in which 22 more articles were identified. After screening, 33 articles on humans and 34 on animals and animal products were included in this review. In humans, Nigeria reported the highest prevalence (62.7\%), followed by Malawi (21\%) and South Africa (20.3\%). For Campylobacter infections in under-five children, Kenya reported 16.4\%, followed by Rwanda (15.5\%) and Ethiopia (14.5\%). The country-level mean prevalence in all ages and under-five children was 18.6\% and 9.4\%, respectively. The prevalence ranged from 1.7\%-62.7\% in humans and 1.2\%-80\% in animals. The most reported species were C. jejuni and C. coli. The AMR to commonly used antimicrobials ranged from 0-100\% in both humans and animals. Poultry consumption and drinking surface water were the main risk factors for campylobacteriosis. The present review provides evidence of thermophilic Campylobacter occurrence in humans and animals and high levels of AMR in SSA, emphasizing the need for strengthening both national and regional multisectoral antimicrobial resistance standard surveillance protocols to curb both the campylobacteriosis burden and increase of antimicrobial resistance in the region.},

	abstract = {STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The performance of the autogenous bone ring (ABR) technique used for the vertical bone augmentation procedure has not yet been determined. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate whether the ABR technique for the vertical bone augmentation procedure with simultaneous implant placement enhances the histologic and histomorphometric outcomes in surgically created bone defects in animal models. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An electronic search of 3 databases, Medline/PubMed, Science Direct, Lilacs, and a manual search of a reference list of relevant studies were performed. Only animal studies regarding vertical bone augmentation by using the ABR technique with simultaneous implant placement in surgically created bone defects were included in the review. The SYstematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experimentation tool was used to determine the risk of bias assessment, and the quality of included studies was assessed by using the Animal Research: Reporting in Vivo Experiments guidelines. RESULTS: Five studies were included in the qualitative analysis based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. One study comparing the ABR technique with the bovine and biphasic ring reported a high percentage of bone area and bone implant contact of the ABR at 5 weeks of osseointegration. Similar histologic findings were reported in another study at 4 months of healing, but contrasting data were reported at 8 months. Another study reported an increase in the percentage of bone area and bone implant contact of the ABR technique from 3 months to 6 months of osseointegration. Two studies reported an increase in the percentage of bone area, and 1 study reported a decrease in the mean of bone implant contact, both with simultaneous and staged implant procedures. CONCLUSION: Based on the limited available studies, the use of the ABR technique for the vertical bone augmentation procedure with simultaneous implant placement presented optimal histologic and histomorphometric outcomes in surgically created bone defects in animal models. However, the results of the current review are not sufficiently robust to support the use of the ABR technique for vertical bone augmentation in humans.},

	abstract = {Introduction: A phenomenon of decreasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among fecal bacteria as food animals age has been noted in multiple field studies. We conducted a scoping review to summarize the extent, range, and nature of research activity and the data for the following question: "does AMR among enteric/fecal bacteria predictably shift as animals get older?". Methods: This review followed a scoping review methodology framework. Pertinent literature published up until November 2018 for all animals (except humans) was retrieved using keyword searches in two online databases, namely, PubMed® and the Web of Science™ Core Collection, without filtering publication date, geographic location, or language. Data were extracted from the included studies, summarized, and plotted. Study quality was also assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines for all included papers. Results: The publications with detailed relevant data (n = 62) in food animals, poultry, and dogs were identified. These included longitudinal studies (n = 32), cross-sectional studies of different age groups within one food animal production system or small-animal catchment area (n = 16), and experimental or diet trials (n = 14). A decline in host-level prevalence and/or within-host abundance of AMR among fecal bacteria in production beef, dairy cattle, and swine was reported in nearly two-thirds (65\%) of the identified studies in different geographic locations from the 1970's to 2018. Mixed results, with AMR abundance among fecal bacteria either increasing or decreasing with age, have been reported in poultry (broiler chicken, layer, and grow-out turkey) and dogs. Conclusions: Quantitative synthesis of the data suggests that the age-dependent AMR phenomenon in cattle and swine is observed irrespective of geographic location and specific production practices. It is unclear whether the phenomenon predates or is related to antimicrobial drug use. However, almost 50\% of the identified studies predate recent changes in antimicrobial drug use policy and regulations in food animals in the United States and elsewhere.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0206520},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Projected temperature rise in the upcoming years due to climate change has increased interest in studying the effects of heat stress in dairy cows. Environmental indices are commonly used for detecting heat stress, but have been used mainly in studies focused on the productivity-related effects of heat stress. The welfare approach involves identifying physiological and behavioural measurements so as to start heat stress mitigation protocols before the appearance of impending severe health or production issues. Therefore, there is growing interest in studying the effects of heat stress on welfare. This systematic review seeks to summarise the animal-based responses to heat stress (physiological and behavioural, excluding productivity) that have been used in scientific literature. METHODS: Using systematic review guidelines set by PRISMA, research articles were identified, screened and summarised based on inclusion criteria for physiology and behaviour, excluding productivity, for animal-based resilience indicators. 129 published articles were reviewed to determine which animal-based indicators for heat stress were most frequently used in dairy cows. RESULTS: The articles considered report at least 212 different animal-based indicators that can be aggregated into body temperature, feeding, physiological response, resting, drinking, grazing and pasture-related behaviour, reactions to heat management and others. The most common physiological animal-based indicators are rectal temperature, respiration rate and dry matter intake, while the most common behavioural indicators are time spent lying, standing and feeding. CONCLUSION: Although body temperature and respiration rate are the animal-based indicators most frequently used to assess heat stress in dairy cattle, when choosing an animal-based indicator for detecting heat stress using scientific literature to establish thresholds, characteristics that influence the scale of the response and the definition of heat stress must be taken into account, e.g. breed, lactation stage, milk yield, system type, climate region, bedding type, diet and cooling management strategies.},

	doi = {10.1111/brv.12517},
	abstract = {Land-use change modifies the spatial structure of terrestrial landscapes, potentially shaping the distribution, abundance and diversity of remaining species assemblages. Non-human primates can be particularly vulnerable to landscape disturbances, but our understanding of this topic is far from complete. Here we reviewed all available studies on primates' responses to landscape structure. We found 34 studies of 71 primate species (24 genera and 10 families) that used a landscape approach. Most studies (82\%) were from Neotropical forests, with howler monkeys being the most frequently studied taxon (56\% of studies). All studies but one used a site-landscape or a patch-landscape study design, and frequently (34\% of studies) measured landscape variables within a given radius from the edge of focal patches. Altogether, the 34 studies reported 188 responses to 17 landscape-scale metrics. However, the majority of the studies (62\%) quantified landscape predictors within a single spatial scale, potentially missing significant primate-landscape responses. To assess such responses accurately, landscape metrics need to be measured at the optimal scale, i.e. the spatial extent at which the primate-landscape relationship is strongest (so-called 'scale of effect'). Only 21\% of studies calculated the scale of effect through multiscale approaches. Interestingly, the vast majority of studies that do not assess the scale of effect mainly reported null effects of landscape structure on primates, while most of the studies based on optimal scales found significant responses. These significant responses were primarily to landscape composition variables rather than landscape configuration variables. In particular, primates generally show positive responses to increasing forest cover, landscape quality indices and matrix permeability. By contrast, primates show weak responses to landscape configuration. In addition, half of the studies showing significant responses to landscape configuration metrics did not control for the effect of forest cover. As configuration metrics are often correlated with forest cover, this means that documented configuration effects may simply be driven by landscape-scale forest loss. Our findings suggest that forest loss (not fragmentation) is a major threat to primates, and thus, preventing deforestation (e.g. through creation of reserves) and increasing forest cover through restoration is critically needed to mitigate the impact of land-use change on our closest relatives. Increasing matrix functionality can also be critical, for instance by promoting anthropogenic land covers that are similar to primates' habitat.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasmosis is one of the most frequent food-borne infections in humans caused by an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. Rodents, as intermediate and reservoir hosts, play key role in the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis; because they are the main source of infection for the Felidae family members and establish the parasite life cycle. Hence, the infectious isolates of T. gondii in rodents may be the main genotypes infecting the environment, humans and animals. Our review aimed to present the population structure of T. gondii in these mammals. To access the relevant studies, six English language databases were systematically searched from 1990 to 2019. Finally, 3,395 samples of rodents were analysed for the genotyping data and 118 isolates were separated from the samples. The results of the present study showed that atypical genotypes were dominant with a frequency of 65.2\% of the total isolates (77 out of 118). Clonal Types II, III and I had less frequency, respectively. Type I clonal isolates were identified only from Asia. The examination of genotypes circulating in rodents around the world revealed that ToxoDB \#1 or \#3 (Type II) were the most common, followed by ToxoDB \#9 and \#2, respectively. Overall, our data showed low genetic diversity of T. gondii with circulating clonal strains in rodents compare to the isolates from Europe, North America and Africa, while non-clonal parasites with high genetic diversity were dominant in South America and Asia.},

Rodents, as intermediate and reservoir hosts, play a key role in the maintenance and transmission of T. gondii. They can be contaminated and maintain the parasite in the form of cysts in their bodies, demonstrating an infection source for their offsprings, predators (particularly felids), and other animals. Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis study was carried out to evaluate the global seroprevalence of T. gondii in these mammals. For achieving the purpose of the current study, six English databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, and Google Scholar) were systematically searched for related studies from 1970 to 2018. Finally, a total of 52,372 records were screened, 105 records including 26,221 rodents were incorporated in the present study. By random effect models, the overall seroprevalence was calculated at 6\% (95\% CI = 6-7\%), with the highest amount was observed in Africa (24\%) and South America (18\%), and the lowest amount in Europe (1\%). The subgroup data analysis by gender manifested that the prevalence of Immunoglobulin G antibodies did not differ between genders (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Due to the significant heterogeneity, meta-regression models were applied based on serological techniques and continental regions; however, the obtained values were not statistically significant (P = 0.480 and P = 0.295, respectively). The present study revealed a relatively low level of T. gondii seroprevalence in rodents; however, if they were the main food source for their predators, they would cause high transmission of T. gondii.},

	abstract = {Hypoxia in aquatic ecosystems is often a result of anthropogenic activities, such as increased nutrient loading, originating from agriculture or urbanization, as well as global warming. Aquatic invertebrates are especially important in ecosystems due to their central role in secondary production and in dynamics of food webs. To better understand impacts of oxygen availability on key physiological processes in invertebrates, we conducted a literature search and synthesized the findings of published studies. We found 55 studies that quantified impacts of hypoxia on feeding, growth, reproduction and respiration rates in 54 different aquatic invertebrate species. We applied non-linear regression models which took into account phylogenetic correlation in the data set. Fitting Michaelis-Menten models, we found that there were differences in how different processes responded to a decline in oxygen availability. Respiration rates were halved at highest oxygen concentration (6.44 mg O(2)/L), followed by reproductive (3.66 mg O(2)/L), growth (1.77 mg O(2)/L) and, finally, feeding rates (0.77 mg O(2)/L). Our findings confirm observations that reproduction is highly sensitive as organisms quickly reduce their reproductive output when exposed to stressful conditions. As long as they have sufficient reserves, organisms continue growing even under stressful conditions, and we confirmed that growth was not very sensitive to a decline in oxygen availability. We discuss potential impacts of global warming on oxygen availability and demand for aquatic macroinvertebrates. Given that oxygen availability is declining in many ecosystems, we can expect that organismal responses will be increasingly compromised with potential consequences for ecosystems and the services they deliver.},

	abstract = {Background Asthma is one of the most common chronic inflammatory conditions of the lungs in modern society. Asthma is associated with airway hyperresponsiveness and remodeling of the airways, with typical symptoms of cough, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness. Interleukins (IL) play an integral role in its inflammatory pathogenesis. Medicinal herbs and secondary metabolites are gaining considerable attention due to their potential therapeutic role and pharmacological mechanisms as adjunct tools to synthetic bronchodilator drugs. Purpose To systematically review the literature on the use of single or mixed plants extracts therapy in vivo experimental systems for asthma, emphasizing their regulations on IL production to improve lung. Methods Literature searches were performed on PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science databases. All articles in English were extracted from 1999 up to September 2019, assessed critically for data extraction. Studies investigating the effectiveness and safety of plant extracts administered; inflammatory cell count, immunoglobulin E (IgE) production and regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine and T helper (Th) 1 and Th2-driven cytokine expression in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung of asthmatic animals were included. Results Four hundred and eighteen publications were identified and 51 met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-six studies described bioactive compounds from plant extracts. The most frequent immunopharmacological mechanisms described included reduction in IgE and eosinophilic recruitment, decreased mucus hypersecretion and airway hyperreactivity, enhancement of the balance of Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio, suppression of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and reversal of structural alterations.

T helper (Th)1 and Th2 cytokines balance plays an essential role in the reaction of inflammatory, allergic and infectious processes and transplantation rejection. PURPOSE: This systematic review focuses on various classes of flavonoids with a view to evaluate whether Th1/Th2 cytokine-mediated pathways of immunoenhancement could reduce immune overwhelming reactions. METHODS: Articles in English published from inception to December 2017 reporting flavonoids with immunomodulatory activity for the management of immune-mediated disorders were acquired from PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science and a animal experiments where Th1 and Th2 cytokines were investigated to assess the outcome of immunoregulatory therapy were included. CHAPTERS: 1809 publications were identified and 26 were included in this review. Ten articles described the effect of flavonoids on allergic inflammation in an animal model of asthma; eleven in vivo studies evaluated the immunomodulating and immunosuppressive effects of flavonoids on Th1/Th2 cytokines production and five reports described the regulatory role of flavonoids for Th1/Th2 cytokine responses to experimental arthritis and myocarditis. Modulation of Th1/Th2 cytokine balance, inhibition of eosinophil accumulation and remodeling of the airways and lungs, downregulation of Notch and PI3K signaling pathways, regulation of CD4 + /CD8 + lymphocytes ratio and decreasing inflammatory mediator expressions levels are among the most important immunopharmacological mechanisms for the retrieved flavonoids.

OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to assess the associations between exposure to cats or dogs and the development of asthma and allergic rhinitis. METHODS: A systematic review was performed to identify case-control and cohort studies before May 2019, evaluating the association between exposure to cats and dogs and the risk of asthma and rhinitis. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The odds ratios (ORs) and risk ratios (RRs) were pooled for case-control and cohort studies, respectively. Subgroup analyses were performed on prespecified study-level characteristics. RESULTS: The meta-analysis of 34 cohort studies showed a protective role of exposure to cats [RR: 0.88, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.77-0.99] or dogs (RR: 0.85, 95\% CI: 0.73-0.97) in the development of asthma. The subgroup analysis of birth cohort (RR: 0.74, 95\% CI: 0.56-0.93) and children population (RR: 0.83, 95\% CI: 0.70-0.96) also suggested a favorable role of exposure to dogs in the development of asthma. Pooled evidence from 13 case-control studies indicated no significant impact of cats (OR: 1.66, 95\% CI: 0.39-2.94) and dogs (OR: 1.22, 95\% CI: 0.92-1.52) on the development of asthma. A pooled analysis of five cohort studies showed a favorable effect of exposure to cats (RR: 0.60, 95\% CI: 0.33-0.86) or dogs (RR: 0.68, 95\% CI 0.44-0.90) on the development of allergic rhinitis. CONCLUSION: The findings indicated a protective effect of exposure to cats and dogs, especially ownership, on the development of asthma and allergic rhinitis.},

It occurs primarily as manifestation of other pathological processes, such as viral hepatitis, cirrhosis, and toxin exposure that affect directly the cellular process. Studies were selected from PubMed and Scopus databases according to the PRISMA statement. The research filters were constructed using three parameters: flavonoids, hepatocellular carcinoma, and animal model. The bias analysis of the 34 selected works was done using the ARRIVE guidelines. The most widely used flavonoid in the studies was epigallocatechin gallate extracted from green tea. In general, the treatment with different flavonoids presented inhibition of tumor growth and antiangiogenic, antimetastatic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. The bias analysis evidenced the absence of methodological processes in all studies, such as the age or weight of the animals, the method of flavonoids' extraction, or the experimental designs, analytical methods, and outcome measures. It has been known that flavonoids have a protective effect against HCC. However, the absence or incomplete characterization of the animal models, treatment protocols, and phytochemical and toxicity analyses impaired the internal validity of the individual studies, making it difficult to determine the effectiveness of plant-derived products in the treatment of HCC.},

Objective: We aimed to establish whether resuscitation with air during chest compression is feasible and safe in newborn infants compared with 100\% oxygen. Methods: Systematic search of PubMed, Google Scholar and CINAHL for articles examining variable oxygen concentrations during chest compressions in term newborns. Results: Overall, no human studies but eight animal studies (n = 323 animals) comparing various oxygen concentrations during chest compression were identified. The pooled analysis showed no difference in mortality rates for animals resuscitated with air vs. 100\% oxygen (risk ratio 1.04 [0.35, 3.08], I(2) = 0\%, p = 0.94). ROSC was also similar between groups with a mean difference of -3.8 [-29.7-22] s, I(2) = 0\%, p = 0.77. No difference in oxygen damage or adverse events were identified between groups. Conclusions: Air had similar time to ROSC and mortality as 100\% oxygen during neonatal chest compression. A large randomized controlled clinical trial comparing air vs. 100\% oxygen during neonatal chest compression is warranted.},

	abstract = {Yogurt is a good source of probiotics, calcium, and proteins, but its content of vitamin D is low. Therefore, yogurt could be a good choice for vitamin D fortification to improve the positive health outcomes associated with its consumption. The primary aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effect of vitamin D-fortified yogurt compared with plain yogurt on levels of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD). The secondary aim was to evaluate the effect of fortified yogurt on parathyroid hormone, anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, glucose metabolism, and lipid profile. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for eligible studies; that is, randomized controlled trials (RCT) that compared vitamin D-fortified yogurt with control treatment without any additional supplement. Random-effects models were used to estimate pooled effect sizes and 95\% confidence intervals. Findings from 9 RCT (n = 665 participants) that lasted from 8 to 16 wk are summarized in this review. The meta-analyzed mean differences for random effects showed that vitamin D-fortified yogurt (from 400 to 2,000 IU) increased serum 25OHD by 31.00 nmol/L. In addition, vitamin D-fortified yogurt decreased parathyroid hormone by 15.47 ng/L, body weight by 0.92 kg, waist circumference by 2.01 cm, HOMA-IR by 2.18 mass units, fasting serum glucose by 22.54 mg/dL, total cholesterol by 13.38 mg/dL, and triglycerides by 30.12 mg/dL compared with the controlled treatments. No publication bias was identified. Considerable between-study heterogeneity was observed for most outcomes. Vitamin D-fortified yogurt may be beneficial in improving serum 25OHD, lipid profile, glucose metabolism, and anthropometric parameters and decreasing parathyroid hormone level in pregnant women and adult and elderly subjects with or without diabetes, prediabetes, or metabolic syndrome.},

There is controversy around which modalities account for the best microsurgical training. In this study, we aim to provide a systematic literature review of the practical modalities in microsurgery training and compare the living and nonliving models, emphasizing the superiority of the former. We introduce the concept of non-technical skill acquisition in microsurgical training with the use of living laboratory animals in the context of a novel proposed curriculum. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on PubMed/Medline and Scopus within the past 11 years based on a combination of the following keywords: "microsurgery," "training," "skills," and "models." The online screening process was performed by two independent reviewers with the Covidence tool. A total of 101 papers was identified as relevant to our study. The protocol was reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. RESULTS: Living models offer the chance to develop both technical and non-technical competencies (i.e., leadership, situation awareness, decision-making, communication, and teamwork). Prior experience with ex vivo tissues helps residents consolidate basic skills prior to performing more advanced techniques in the living tissues. Trainees reported a higher satisfaction rate with the living models. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of living and nonliving training microsurgical models leads to superior results; however, the gold standard remains the living model. The validity of the hypothesis that living models enhance non-technical skills remains to be confirmed.Level of evidence: Not ratable.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic MEDLINE (PubMed) online library search was conducted for preclinical animal studies in vivo , using autologous periodontal ligament, dental pulp, cementum, alveolar periosteal, gingival margin or adipose stem cell types for periodontal tissue complex regeneration purposes. Studies had to be published between 2007.09.01 and 2017.09.01 in the English language. RESULTS: Online library search yielded 2099 results. After the title, abstract and full-text screening ten studies fit inclusion criteria and were pooled into meta-analysis. Overall the stem cell regenerative therapy had a statistically significant positive influence on the periodontal tissue regeneration when compared to the control groups. The biggest influence was made to the regeneration of cementum (standardised mean difference [SMD] 2.25 [95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.31 to 3.2]) while the smallest influence was made to the alveolar bone (SMD 1.47 [95\% CI = 0.7 to 2.25]) the effect size for periodontal ligament regeneration was (SMD 1.8 [95\% CI = 1 to 2.59]). Subgroup analysis showed statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.05) differences between different cell types in the alveolar bone and cementum regeneration groups and in alveolar bone group in relation to scaffold materials. CONCLUSIONS: Stem cell therapy has a positive impact on periodontal tissue complex regeneration. Such therapy has the biggest influence on cementum regeneration meanwhile alveolar bone regeneration is influenced by the least amount. However more and less diverse preclinical studies are needed to have a greater statistical power in future meta-analyses.},

	volume = {8},
	doi = {10.1002/brb3.982},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a globally prevalent neurodegenerative disease, clinically characterized by progressive memory loss and gradual impairment of cognitive functions. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation has been considered a possible therapeutic method for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, no quantitative data synthesis of MSC therapy for AD exists. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to study the effects of MSCs on cognitive deficits in animal models of AD. METHODS: We identified eligible studies published from January 1980 to January 2017 by searching four electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CNKI). The endpoint was the effects of MSCs on cognitive performance evaluated by the Morris water maze (MWM) test including escape latency, and/or number of platform crossing, and/or time in the target quadrant. RESULTS: Nine preclinical studies incorporating 225 animals with AD were included for the meta-analysis. The studies indicated that MSC-based treatment significantly improved the learning function through measurements of the escape latency (SMD = -0.99, 95\% CI = -1.33 to -0.64, p {\textless} .00001). Additionally, we observed that transplantation of MSCs significantly increased the number of platform crossing in six experiments (SMD = 0.78, 95\% CI = 0.43 to 1.13, p {\textless} .0001). What's more, the times in the target quadrant were increased in five studies indicated that transplantation of MSCs could ameliorate the cognitive impairments (SMD = 1.06, 95\% CI = 0.46 to 1.67, p = .0005). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that MSC transplantation could reduce cognitive deficits in AD models. These findings support the further studies to translate MSCs in the treatment of AD in humans.},

	abstract = {Research on the impact of companion animals in the lives of older adults is considered from two perspectives: pet ownership and in animal-assisted interventions (AAI). This paper first presents a discussion of potential theoretical explanations of the impact of animals on human health and wellbeing among older adults, and then provides a systematic review and evaluation of existing research on the topics of human-animal interaction (HAI) and physical health and exercise, depression and anxiety, and loneliness and social functioning. Each of the studies in this review (n=145) are rated according to modified Oxford Center for Evidence Based Medicine (OCEBM) levels and the role of theory, in conceptualizing the study or interpreting outcomes, is discussed. The quality of evidence for each topical area of HAI and aging research is summarized, and recommendations are made for future research directions that will increase our knowledge of the relationship between HAI and health outcomes for older adults in different settings.},

	abstract = {The number of studies evaluating platelet-rich plasma (PRP) concentration has substantially grown in the last fifteen years. A systematic review on this field has been realized by evaluating in the identified studies the in vitro PRP concentration-also analyzing the platelet amount-and the in vivo PRP effects in tissue regeneration compared to any control. The protocol has been developed in agreement with the Preferred Reporting for Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. Multistep research of the PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, PreMEDLINE, Ebase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Clinicaltrials.gov, Scopus database and Cochrane databases has permitted to identify articles on different concentrations of PRP in vitro and related in vivo impact for tissue repair. Of the 965 articles initially identified, 30 articles focusing on PRP concentration have been selected and, consequently, only 15 articles have been analyzed. In total, 40\% (n = 6) of the studies were related to the fixed PRP Concentration Group used a fixed PRP concentration and altered the platelet concentration by adding the different volumes of the PRP (lysate) to the culture. This technique led to a substantial decrease in nutrition available at higher concentrations. Sixty percent (n = 9) of the studies were related to the fixed PRP Volume Group that used a fixed PRP-to-media ratio (Vol/Vol) throughout the experiment and altered the concentration within the PRP volume. For both groups, when the volume of medium (nutrition) decreases, a lower rate of cell proliferation is observed. A PRP concentration of 1.0 × 10(6) plt/μL, appears to be optimal thanks to the constant and plentiful capillary nutrition supply and rapid diffusion of growth factors that happen in vivo and it also respects the blood decree-law. The PRP/media ratio should provide a sufficient nutrition supply to prevent cellular starvation, that is, PRP ≤ 10\% (Vol/Vol) and thus best mimic the conditions in vivo.},

AD-MSCs are easily accessible from various fat depots and show intrinsic plasticity in giving rise to cell types involved in wound healing and angiogenesis. AD-MSCs have been used in the treatment of soft tissue defects and chronic wounds, employed in conjunction with a fat grafting technique or with dermal substitute scaffolds and platelet-rich plasma. In this systematic review, an overview of the current knowledge on this topic has been provided, based on existing studies and the authors' experience. A multistep search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, PreMEDLINE, Ebase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Clinicaltrials.gov, Scopus database, and Cochrane databases has been performed to identify papers on AD-MSCs, PRP, and biomaterials used in soft tissue defects and chronic wounds. Of the 2136 articles initially identified, 422 articles focusing on regenerative strategies in wound healing were selected and, consequently, only 278 articles apparently related to AD-MSC, PRP, and biomaterials were initially assessed for eligibility. Of these, 85 articles were excluded as pre-clinical, experimental, and in vitro studies. For the above-mentioned reasons, 193 articles were selected; of this amount, 121 letters, expert opinions, commentary, and editorials were removed. The remaining 72 articles, strictly regarding the use of AD-MSCs, PRP, and biomaterials in chronic skin wounds and soft tissue defects, were analyzed. The studies included had to match predetermined criteria according to the patients, intervention, comparator, outcomes, and study design (PICOS) approach. The information analyzed highlights the safety and efficacy of AD-MSCs, PRP, and biomaterials on soft tissue defects and chronic wounds, without major side effects.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) is a debilitating side effect arising from chemotherapy treatments. The condition is characterised by a range of cognitive deficits including impairment to memory, attention, and concentration. Whilst the underlying mechanisms that contribute to CICI remain unclear, neuroinflammation has been suggested as one key contributor. METHOD: A comprehensive systematic search of EMBASE and Medline via PubMed was conducted to identify studies on neuroimmune reactivity marker expression changes and resulting cognitive changes in preclinical rodent models of CICI. RESULTS: A total of twenty studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the scoping review. There was significant heterogeneity in the methodology employed in the included studies. Our findings demonstrate that widespread changes in cytokines, chemokines, microglia reactivity, and astrocyte reactivity are observed in CICI in the brain regions expected to be affected, given the nature of the cognitive impairment observed in CICI. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was considerable heterogeneity in study design that made comparisons between studies difficult, our findings suggest that neuroinflammation commonly occurs in CICI preclinical rodent models and shows an association with cognitive impairment.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Venomous snakebite severity ranges from an asymptomatic dry bite to severe envenomation and death. The clinical evaluation aids in prognosis and is essential to determine the risks and potential benefits of antivenom treatment. OBJECTIVES: To identify historical features, clinical examination findings, basic laboratory testing, and clinical grading scales that will risk-stratify patients with pit viper snake envenomation for severe systemic envenomation, severe tissue injury, and/or severe hematologic venom effects. DATA SOURCES: We conducted a structured search of PubMed (1966-October 3, 2017) and Embase database (1980-October 3, 2017) to identify English-language studies that evaluated clinical features predictive of severe envenomation. STUDY SELECTION: We included studies that evaluated the test performance of at least 1 clinical finding with an acceptable reference standard of severe envenomation for venomous snakes of the Western Hemisphere. Only studies involving the most common subfamily, Crotalinae (pit vipers), were evaluated. Seventeen studies with data were available for abstraction. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The clinical features assessed and severity outcome measures were extracted from each original study. We assessed severity in 3 categories: systemic toxicity, tissue injury, and hematologic effects. Differences were resolved by author consensus. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of severe systemic envenomation was 14\% (95\% CI, 9\%-21\%). The pooled prevalence of severe tissue injury and severe hematologic venom effects were 14\% (95\% CI, 12\%-16\%) and 18\% (95\% CI, 8\%-27\%), respectively. Factors increasing the likelihood of severe systemic envenomation included the time from bite to care of 6 or more hours (likelihood ratio [LR], 3.4 [95\% CI, 1.1-6.4]), a patient younger than 12 years (LRs, 3.2 [95\% CI, 1.5-7.1] and 2.9 [95\% CI, 1.3-6.2]), large snake size (LR, 3.1 [95\% CI, 1.5-5.7]), and ptosis (LRs, 1.4 [95\% CI, 1.0-2.1] and 3.8 [95\% CI, 1.8-8.3]). Envenomation by the genus Agkistrodon (copperhead and cottonmouth), as opposed to rattlesnakes, decreased the likelihood of severe systemic envenomation (LR, 0.28 [95\% CI, 0.10-0.78]). Initial hypofibrinogenemia (LR, 5.1 [95\% CI, 1.7-15.0]) and thrombocytopenia (LR, 3.7 [95\% CI, 1.9-7.3]) increased the likelihood of severe hematologic venom effects. Other clinical features from history, physical examination, or normal laboratory values were not discriminative. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical features can identify patients at increased risk of severe systemic envenomation and severe hematologic venom effects, but there are few features that are associated with severe tissue injury or can confidently exclude severe envenomation. Physicians should monitor patients closely and be wary of progression from nonsevere to a severe envenomation and have a low threshold to escalate therapy as needed.},

Many AIV strains were studied in challenge experiments in poultry, but no study has combined data from those studies to identify general AIV shedding patterns. These systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to summarize qualitative and quantitative information on virus shedding levels and duration for different AIV strains in experimentally infected poultry species.

A total of 1155 abstract were screened, with 117 studies selected for the qualitative analysis and 71 studies for the meta-analysis. A large heterogeneity in experimental methods was observed and the quantitative analysis showed that experimental variables such as species, virus origin, age, inoculation route and dose, affect virus shedding (mean, peak and duration) for highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV), low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) or both. In conclusion, this study highlights the need to standardize experimental procedures, it provides a comprehensive summary of the shedding patterns of AIV strains by infected poultry and identifies the variables that influence the level and duration of AIV shedding.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Nonautologous graft materials may solve several dilemmas in tympanoplasty by obviating the need for graft harvest, facilitating consistent wound healing, and permitting graft placement in the clinical setting. Prior studies of nonautologous grafts in humans have shown variable outcomes. In this systematic review, we aim to 1) summarize clinical outcomes and 2) discuss limitations in the literature regarding nonautologous grafts for tympanoplasty in humans. METHODS: A literature review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. The study size, etiology and duration of perforation, type of nonautologous graft, and postoperative closure rate were assessed. RESULTS: The PRISMA approach yielded 61 articles, including 3,247 ears that met inclusion criteria. Studies evaluated nonautologous grafts including paper patch, gelatin sponge, growth factors, porcine small-intestinal submucosa, among others. Traumatic perforations (62.3\%) were most commonly studied, whereas postinfectious perforations (31.9\%) and other etiologies (5.8\%) comprised a minority of cases. Acute perforations of {\textless}8 weeks duration constituted just over half of all treated ears. Overall closure rate was 82.1\%, with significantly higher closure rates in acute (89.9\%) versus chronic perforations (64.9\%, P {\textless} .01), regardless of material. A median postoperative air-bone gap of 5.6 dB was found in the 23\% of studies reporting this metric. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of publications reviewing nonautologous materials in tympanoplasty evaluate acute or traumatic perforations, and few rigorously report hearing outcomes. Given available data, porcine submucosa and basic fibroblast growth factor may hold promise for chronic perforation closure. Future studies should report closure rates and hearing outcomes in perforations {\textgreater}8 weeks duration. Laryngoscope, 131:392-400, 2021.},

	abstract = {AIM: Growth factors (GFs) are polypeptides, which are intricately involved in the regulation of bone formation, preservation, and regeneration through gene expression. However, the role of these bioactive agents in osseointegration of dental implants has not been substantially proven. The objective of this systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis was to explore the effect of GFs on early osseointegration of dental implants in animal jaws. An attempt to decipher an adjunctive role of GFs in modulating predictable bone growth in peri-implant areas was done. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic and manual search of different databases was performed. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included and reviewed. The risk of bias (ROB) of the selected studies was assessed using the SR Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (Cochrane) tool. A meta-analysis was also performed to evaluate the different study characteristics quantitatively. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The total Weighted mean difference was evaluated using the Rev-Manv5.3 algorithm. Chi-square test and I(2) test were done to assess the heterogeneity between the studies. RESULTS: Seven RCTs were included in the study. These were associated with a high ROB. The total weighted mean difference (WMD) of the percentage of bone-implant contact was 3.25\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.49\%-6.03\%; P = 0.001; I(2) = 91\%) between groups with and without exogenous application of GFs. The total WMD of the percentage of newly formed bone area was 4.48\% (95\% CI = 2.31\%-5.90\%; P {\textless} 0.00001, I(2) = 84\%). A high level of heterogeneity (P {\textless} 0.001 for Chi-square test; I (2){\textgreater}50 \%) among comparable studies was observed. CONCLUSION: The ancillary application of external GFs exhibited evidence of early osseointegration, resulting in more predictable and faster results. However, a careful discernment of conclusions drawn from this SR is a must before conducting any human trials.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Prematurely born infants regularly develop respiratory distress syndrome and require assisted ventilation. Ventilation may injure the premature lung and increase the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a form of noninvasive ventilation, is commonly used in modern neonatology. Limited clinical data are available on the acute and long-term effect of neonatal exposure to CPAP on the lung. Given the restricted clinical data, newborn animal models have been used to study the influence of CPAP on lung structure and function. The findings of animal studies can guide neonatal care and improve the use of CPAP. METHODS: A systematic review of electronic databases (Medline, Embase, and Cinahl) was performed using the medical subject heading terms, "CPAP" or "continuous positive airway pressure" and "animals" and "newborn." Abstracts were screened for inclusion using predetermined eligibility criteria. RESULTS: In total, 235 abstracts were identified and screened for inclusion. Of these, 21 papers were included. Large (N = 18) and small (N = 3) animal models investigated the effects of CPAP. Pulmonary outcomes included gas exchange, lung structure and function, surfactant metabolism, lung inflammation and injury, and the effect of intrapulmonary therapy. Compared to mechanical ventilation, CPAP improves lung function, evokes less lung injury, and does not disrupt alveolar development. Surfactant administration combined with CPAP further improves respiratory outcomes. Of concern are findings that CPAP may increase airway reactivity. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: CPAP offers numerous advantages over mechanical ventilation for the immature lung. The combination of CPAP and exogenous surfactant administration offers further pulmonary benefit.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Long-term cognitive impairment is a complication of critical illness survivors. Beside its lifesaving role, mechanical ventilation has potential complications. The aim of this study is to systematically review the evidence collected in animal studies that correlate mechanical ventilation with neuroinflammation, neuronal damage and cognitive impairment. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for studies published from inception until August 31st, 2020, that enrolled mechanically ventilated animals and reported on neuroinflammation or neuronal damage markers changes or cognitive-behavioural impairment. RESULTS: Of 5583 studies, 11 met inclusion criteria. Mice, rats, pigs were used. Impact of MV: 4 out of 7 studies reported higher neuroinflammation markers in MV-treated animals and 3 studies reported no differences; 7 out of 8 studies reported a higher neuronal damage and 1 reported no differences; 2 out of 2 studies reported cognitive decline up to 3 days after MV. Higher Tidal volumes are associated with higher changes in brain or serum markers. CONCLUSION: Preclinical evidence suggests that MV induces neuroinflammation, neuronal damage and cognitive impairment and these are worsened if sub-optimal MV settings are applied. Future studies, with appropriate methodology, are necessary to evaluate for serum monitoring strategies. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42019148935.},

	abstract = {Use of complementary and alternative medicine for wound healing is influencing mainstream medical practice. This systematic review evaluates the role of Calendula officinalis flower extract as monotherapy compared to control for wound healing in vivo. Searches were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and Scopus (up to April 2018) with 14 studies meeting the inclusion criteria, comprising 7 animal experiments and 7 clinical trials. Findings from the review on acute wound healing showed faster resolution of the inflammation phase with increased production of granulation tissue in the test groups treated with extract. These findings were consistent in five animal studies and one randomized clinical trial. Chronic wound healing studies were varied. Two clinical control studies on venous ulcers demonstrated decreased ulcer surface area compared to controls. Another randomized clinical trial demonstrated no improvement for the calendula group in diabetic leg ulcer healing. Burn healing similarly showed mixed results. Two animal studies demonstrated a prophylactic effect for the administration of calendula extract prior to burn injury. A randomized clinical trial of patients suffering from partial to full thickness burns demonstrated no benefit for topical application of calendula extract compared to controls. Two randomized clinical trials assessed the potential for extract to prevent acute post radiation dermatitis, with one study showing improvements compared to trolamine, while the other found no improvement compared to aqua gel cream. Animal studies provide moderate evidence for improved recovery from the inflammation phase and increased production of granulation tissue in calendula extract treatment groups. This review identified some evidence for the beneficial effects of C. officinalis extract for wound healing, consistent with its role in traditional medicine. There is a need for larger, well-designed randomized control trials to assess the effect of calendula on wound healing including complications.},

It is unknown if the long-term survival differs between the two valve types.We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare survival in patients who underwent aortic valve replacement and received a bovine or a porcine prosthesis. METHODS:  We performed a systematic search of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Cohort studies that compared survival between patients who underwent aortic valve replacement and received either a bovine or a porcine bioprosthesis and that reported overall long-term survival with hazard ratio (HR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) were included. Two authors independently reviewed articles considered for inclusion, extracted the information from each study, and performed the quality assessment. We performed a meta-analysis using a random effects model to calculate the pooled HR (95\% CI) for all-cause mortality. We did sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings. RESULTS:  Seven studies published between 2010 and 2015 were included, and the combined study population was 49,190 patients. Of these, 32,235 (66\%) received a bovine, and 16,955 (34\%) received a porcine bioprosthesis. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between patients who received a bovine compared with a porcine bioprosthesis (pooled HR 1.00, 95\% CI: 0.92-1.09). Heterogeneity between studies was moderate (55.8\%, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS:  This systematic review and meta-analysis suggest no difference in survival between patients who received a bovine versus a porcine bioprosthesis after aortic valve replacement. Our study provides valuable evidence for the continuing use of both bovine and porcine bioprosthetic valves for surgical aortic valve replacement.},

The aim of this investigation was to use a systematic review and meta-analyses to summarise the results of publications that focused on direct comparisons between full confinement conventional crates and various designs of loose-housed farrowing pens from loading until weaning. Literature searches in Scopus, BIOSIS Previews, Cab Abstracts, and Web of Science identified 6695 articles. Twenty-two publications were retained for the systematic review and individual meta-analyses after screening for inclusion criteria. The random effects meta-analyses were performed on crate versus pen for number of piglets born alive, number of stillborn piglets, pre-weaning mortality, and number of piglets weaned. Additionally, the modifiers of confinement length (no confinement from loading until weaning or partial confinement for shorter periods of time in the early stages post parturition), enrichment (no enrichment or enrichment provided), and pen size (small, medium, or large) were examined. There was a 14\% increase in the relative risk of piglet mortality in farrowing pens when they were compared with crates (p=0.0015). The number of stillborns per litter was not different between the pen and crate. However, when providing enrichment in the pens, there was an increase in stillborns within farrowing crates versus pens (p=0.009). There was no overall effect on piglets that were born alive or number weaned. As there is no difference between piglets born alive and mortality is significantly higher in farrowing pens, a reduction in the number of piglets weaned was expected but not observed, which was possibly due to the lack of weaning details provided in the publications. This was the first systematic review and meta-analysis conducted on the performance of farrowing accommodation and identified that farrowing pens do compromise post-natal piglet survival. Future efforts should focus on improving sow comfort in the farrowing crate to maximize both piglet and sow welfare.},

	abstract = {Although black (Rattus rattus) and brown (Rattus norvegicus) rats are among the most widespread synanthropic wild rodents, there is a surprising scarcity of knowledge about their ecology in the urban ecosystem. In particular, relatively few studies have investigated their helminth species diversity in such habitat. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guideline to synthesize the existing published literature regarding the helminth fauna of urban rats in developed countries (North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan). We aimed at describing the species diversity and richness of urban rat helminths, the species prevalence and associations, the methods of investigation, the pathological changes observed in the hosts, the risk factors of infection and the public health significance of rat-borne helminthiases. Twenty-three scientific papers published between 1946 and 2019 were reviewed, half of them were conducted in Europe. Twenty-five helminth species and eight genera were described from the liver, digestive tract, lungs and muscles of urban rats. The most commonly reported parasite was Calodium hepaticum. Prevalence and risk factors of helminth infection in urban rats varied greatly between studies. Observed pathological findings in the rat host were generally minor, except for C. hepaticum. Several rat helminths can parasitize humans and are therefore of public health significance. The lack of references to identification keys and the rare use of molecular tools for species confirmation represent the main limitation of these studies. Knowledge gap on this topic and the needs for future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The reconstruction of extensive tracheal defects is an unresolved problem. Despite decades of research, a reliable and practical substitute remains to be found. While there have been clinical reports of successful long-segment tracheal reconstruction, reproducibility and widespread applicability of these techniques have yet to be achieved. Large animals such as the dog, pig, sheep, and goat have comparable tracheal morphology and physiology to humans making them useful preclinical models to screen potential therapeutic strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The literature was reviewed to identify large animal models commonly used for tracheal reconstruction. A systematic search of PubMed and EMBASE was performed for large animal studies reporting on the reconstruction of long-segment tracheal and carinal defects. Fifty-seven studies were identified for analysis. RESULTS: There is no standard large animal model available for tracheal research. In recent years, livestock species have gained favor over dogs as animal models in this field. The minimum requirements for successful tracheal replacement are rigidity, vascularity, and epithelial lining. Early attempts with synthetic prostheses were met with disappointing results. An autologous tracheal substitute is ideal but hindered by limited donor site availability and the lack of a dominant vascular pedicle for microsurgical reconstruction. Although tracheal allotransplantation enables like-for-like replacement, there are unresolved issues relating to graft vascularity, immunosuppression, and graft preservation. Tissue engineering holds great promise; however, the optimal combination of scaffold, cells, and culture conditions is still indeterminate. CONCLUSIONS: Despite impressive advances in tracheal reconstruction, a durable substitute for extended tracheal defects continues to be elusive.},

With the increase in popularity of alternative poultry rearing and production systems, it is important to identify the differences in food safety risks presented by alternative systems compared with conventional methods. Although many studies have been conducted that surveyed foodborne pathogen prevalence along the broiler supply chain, a systematic overview of all of the results is lacking. In the current study, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to quantify the differences in prevalence of Salmonella and Campylobacter spp. in farm environment, rehang, prechill, postchill, and retail samples between conventional and alternative production systems. A systematic search of Web of Science and PubMed databases was conducted to identify eligible studies. Studies were then evaluated by inclusion criteria, and the included studies were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. In total, 137 trials from 72 studies were used in the final meta-analysis. Meta-analysis models were individually constructed for subgroups that were determined by sample type, pathogen, and production type. All subgroups possessed high amounts of heterogeneity (I2 {\textgreater} 75\%). For environmental sample subgroups, Campylobacter prevalence was estimated to be 15.8 and 52.8\% for conventional and alternative samples, respectively. Similar prevalence estimates for both production types were observed for Salmonella environmental samples and all retail samples. For conventional samples, Campylobacter and Salmonella prevalence was highest in prechill samples followed by rehang and postchill samples, respectively. The results herein will be useful in future quantitative microbial risk assessments for characterizing the differences in foodborne illness risks presented by different broiler production systems.},

The aim of this review was to explore the capacity of existing PLF technologies to contribute to the assessment of pig welfare. In a web search for commercially available PLF for pigs, 83 technologies were identified. A literature search was conducted, following systematic review guidelines (PRISMA), to identify studies on the validation of sensor technologies for assessing animal-based welfare indicators. Two validation levels were defined: internal (evaluation during system building within the same population that were used for system building) and external (evaluation on a different population than during system building). From 2,463 articles found, 111 were selected, which validated some PLF that could be applied to the assessment of animal-based welfare indicators of pigs (7\% classified as external, and 93\% as internal validation). From our list of commercially available PLF technologies, only 5\% had been externally validated. The more often validated technologies were vision-based solutions (n = 45), followed by load-cells (n = 28; feeders and drinkers, force plates and scales), accelerometers (n = 14) and microphones (n = 14), thermal cameras (n = 10), photoelectric sensors (n = 5), radio-frequency identification (RFID) for tracking (n = 2), infrared thermometers (n = 1), and pyrometer (n = 1). Externally validated technologies were photoelectric sensors (n = 2), thermal cameras (n = 2), microphone (n = 1), load-cells (n = 1), RFID (n = 1), and pyrometer (n = 1). Measured traits included activity and posture-related behavior, feeding and drinking, other behavior, physical condition, and health. In conclusion, existing PLF technologies are potential tools for on-farm animal welfare assessment in pig production. However, validation studies are lacking for an important percentage of market available tools, and in particular research and development need to focus on identifying the feature candidates of the measures (e.g., deviations from diurnal pattern, threshold levels) that are valid signals of either negative or positive animal welfare. An important gap identified are the lack of technologies to assess affective states (both positive and negative states).},

After systematic review, incidence data and study characteristics were extracted from 78 studies conducted in 21 European countries. Pooled prevalence values from 203 extracted observations were estimated from random-effects meta-analysis models adjusted by pathogen, poultry type, sampling stage, cold preservation type, meat cutting type and packaging status. The results suggest that S. aureus is the main pathogen detected in poultry meat (38.5\%; 95\% CI: 25.4⁻53.4), followed by Campylobacter spp. (33.3\%; 95\% CI: 22.3⁻46.4\%), while L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. present lower prevalence (19.3\%; 95\% CI: 14.4⁻25.3\% and 7.10\%; 95\% CI: 4.60⁻10.8\%, respectively). Despite the differences in prevalence, all pathogens were found in chicken and other poultry meats, at both end-processing step and retail level, in packed and unpacked products and in several meat cutting types. Prevalence data on cold preservation products also revealed that chilling and freezing can reduce the proliferation of pathogens but might not be able to inactivate them. The results of this meta-analysis highlight that further risk management strategies are needed to reduce pathogen incidence in poultry meat throughout the entire food chain across Europe, in particular for S. aureus and Campylobacter spp.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Echinococcosis (canine Echinococcus disease) is a neglected tropical disease that causes serious public harm. Dogs, as a terminal host of Echinococcus spp., are a key part of the Echinococcus epidemic. Echinococcosis spreads easily in humans and animals in some areas of China and it is therefore necessary to fully understand the prevalence of Echinococcus spp. in dogs. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Chongqing VIP, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and WanFang databases were searched for relevant articles published in the past 10 years. A final total of 108 studies were included. The overall prevalence of Echinococcus spp. in dogs in China was 7.3\%, with the highest point estimate found in sampling year 2015 (8.2\%) and publication year 2015 (16.5\%). Northwestern China (7.9\%) had the highest infection rate in China. Qinghai Province (13.5\%) showed the highest prevalence among the 11 provinces we included. We also found that geographical and climatic factors are related to the incidence of canine echinococcosis. We further investigated the source of heterogeneity by analysis of subgroups (sampling district, detection method, dog type, season, parasite species, medication, and study quality level). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our research indicated that Echinococcus spp. were still prevalent in some areas in China. More localized prevention and control policies should be formulated, including improving drinking water hygiene and strengthening hygiene promotion. We recommend the rational use of anti-Echinococcus drugs. In addition, treatment of livestock offal and feces and improving the welfare of stray dogs may play an important role in reducing canine Echinococcus infections.},

	abstract = {Background: Brucellosis, a zoonotic disease, infects various hosts, including swine and humans. It has reemerged in recent years as a public health concern, and current studies on brucellosis infection in swine have been conducted worldwide. However, no meta-analyses of global brucellosis infection in swine have been published. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of Brucella species (spp.) in swine worldwide and the factors associated with its persistence. Results: We searched seven databases for published epidemiological studies on brucellosis in pigs, including the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, the VIP Chinese Journal Database and PubMed. We selected 119 articles published from January 1, 2000 to January 3, 2020 for inclusion in the meta-analysis and analyzed the data using a random-effects model. Funnel plots and Egger's test showed significant publication bias in the included studies. The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that our study was relatively stable and reliable. The prevalence of brucellosis in swine was 2.1\% (95\% CI: 1.6-2.6), of which the highest infection rate, which was found in Europe, was 17.4\% (95\% CI: 11.1-24.9). The prevalence in feral pigs (15.0\%, 95\% CI: 8.4-23.2) was higher than that in domestic pigs (1.1\%, 95\% CI 0.2-2.5). The prevalence in high-income countries (15.7\%, 95\% CI 8.0-25.3) was significantly higher than that in middle- (0.8\%, 95\% CI 0.5-1.1), and low-income countries (0.1\%, 95\% CI 0.0-0.2). The prevalence was highest in finishing pigs at 4.9\% (95\% CI 0.9-11.0), and lowest among suckling pigs at 0\% (95\% CI 0.0-0.5). Conclusion: The Brucella prevalence in pig herds currently is distributed widely throughout the world. In some countries, swine brucellosis may be a neglected zoonotic disease. We recommend long-term monitoring of the prevalence of brucellosis in domestic and wild pig herds. Attention should also be paid to animal welfare on intensive pig farms; controlling the breeding density may play an important role in reducing the spread of brucellosis among pigs.},

	abstract = {Background: Bluetongue caused by the bluetongue virus (BTV) is a non-contagious and an insect-borne disease mainly affecting domestic and wild ruminants. Bluetongue in cattle is associated with vesicular lesions, weight loss, low milk production, and low reproductive capacity. It should not be ignored as it is associated with large economic losses to the livestock breeding industry in China. Although many studies have investigated bluetongue virus infection in cattle, no nationwide study on the prevalence of bluetongue virus infection in cattle from China has yet been conducted. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence and risk factors for bluetongue in cattle. Results: We collected 50 publications from 1988 to 2019 through PubMed, ScienceDirect, Chinese Web of Knowledge (CNKI), VIP Chinese journal database, and Wanfang database. A total of the pooled bluetongue seroprevalence of 12.2\% (5,332/87,472) in cattle was tested. The point estimate of bluetongue collected from 2001 to 2011 was 22.5\% (95\% CI: 1.2-58.9), which was higher than after 2012 (9.9\%, 95\% CI: 3.3-19.4). The analysis of the feeding model subgroup revealed that the seroprevalence of bluetongue was significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.05) among free-range cattle (22.5\%; 95\% CI: 7.7-42.3) than among cattle from intensive farming systems (1.8\%; 95\% CI: 0.0-6.7). The seroprevalence of bluetongue in different species showed significant variation (P {\textless} 0.05), with the highest seroprevalence of 39.8\% (95\% CI: 18.7-63.0) in buffalo and the lowest seroprevalence of 4.3\% (95\% CI: 1.2-9.0) in yak. In the zoogeographical division subgroup, the seroprevalence of bluetongue correlated positively within a certain range with the species distribution of Culicoides. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that bluetongue was prevalent in cattle in China. In addition, the contact with sheep, other ruminants, or transmission media such as Culicoides may increase the seroprevalence of bluetongue disease in cattle. It is necessary to carry out continuous monitoring of the bluetongue seroprevalence. Moreover, comprehensive and improved strategies and measures should be implemented to prevent and control the spread of bluetongue.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Swine coccidiosis, a protozoan disease caused by coccidia, can result in diarrhoea and weight loss in piglets and even economic losses in the pig industry. Here, we report the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of coccidia (including Eimeria spp. and Cystoisospora suis) in pigs in China. METHODS: Five databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, Chinese Web of Knowledge, Wanfang, and Chongqing VIP) were searched and 50 studies (46,926 domestic pigs, 22 provinces) ultimately identified pertaining to the prevalence of coccidia infection from 1980 to 2019. We incorporated the effect size using the random-effects model in the "meta" package in R software and conducted univariate and multivariate meta-regression analyses using a mixed-effects model. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence rate of coccidia in pigs was 21.9\%, including the C. suis infection rate of 9.1\%. The highest prevalence of coccidia (39.6\%) was found in northwest China, and this region also presented the lowest prevalence of C. suis (4.7\%). In the subgroup analysis based on sampling year, the highest prevalence of coccidia was detected in 2001 or earlier (32.6\%), whereas the lowest rate was found in 2012 or later (14.3\%). An opposite trend was observed for C. suis (5.5\% in 2000 or earlier vs 14.4\% in 2000 or later). The prevalence of coccidia in extensive farming systems (29.5\%) was higher than that in intensive farming systems (17.3\%). In contrast, the point estimate of C. suis prevalence was lower in the extensive farming systems (5.1\%) than in the intensive farming systems (10.0\%), but the difference was not significant (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Among the four age categories, the highest total coccidia prevalence (26.2\%) was found in finishing pigs, followed by suckling piglets (19.9\%), whereas the highest prevalence of C. suis (14.9\%) was observed in suckling piglets. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that coccidia infection in Chinese pigs is common, although the prevalence of C. suis in pigs does not receive sufficient attention. We recommend the rational use of anticoccidial drugs to avoid drug resistance and the development of preventive and control measures for C. suis to reduce the incidence of swine coccidiosis.},

	abstract = {The risk of developing stress related disorders such as depression is two times higher in women than in men, and social stress is considered the principal etiology for this disorder. Social defeat animal model is the most common procedure to induce social stress in male rodents, but the stressful stimulus and the stress response can be different for each sex. In this regard, social defeat stress model does not fit the social nature of females, and according to the emerging evidence, the social instability stress (SIS) model could be a suitable procedure to investigate this stress related disorder in females. This study aims to systematically review the effects of SIS on physiological and behavioral parameters involved in the pathophysiology of depression, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method on PubMed, Medline and Web of Science. Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. The reported physiological measures comprised the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, neurotrophic factors, immune and monoaminergic systems, vasopressin and oxytocin receptors, sex hormone levels and estrus cycle, while main behavioral measures involved sucrose preference test, forced swimming test, elevated plus maze, open field test and social interaction. This systematic review revealed a wide variability on the social instability regimen and on the measured variables. However, all studies agree that SIS model can elicit behavioral and physiological alteration involved in stress related disorders, with HPA axis hyperactivity, increased anxiety-like behavior and disrupted reward system being the most repeated outcomes. A unified SIS application criterion is required in order to obtain consistent data and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of anxiety and depression in females.},

	abstract = {Sex in crocodilians is not determined by chromosomes, but by egg incubation temperature, where different temperatures produce different clutch sex ratios. Two patterns have been proposed to describe these changes in sex ratios: a 100\% female proportion at low and high temperatures with male predominance at intermediate ones (FMF) or a simpler pattern with a single female-to-male transition (FM). Over the last three decades, researchers have provided empirical information to support either of these two patterns in different species; however, no consensus has been reached partly because data have not been analysed as a whole. Here, we aimed at gathering the existing data on these patterns to provide models of temperature-dependent sex determination in those crocodilians studied so far. Potentially relevant publications were searched on Web of Knowledge, Scopus, Scielo and Science Direct. Studies that reported results on the sexual identity of crocodilian hatchlings obtained from constant temperature incubation treatments were considered. Using statistical models varying in their underlying assumptions, we evaluated which sex-determination pattern was best supported for the studied crocodilians and constructed species-specific and latitude-specific models. Based on the 8,458 sexed hatchlings studied throughout 31 studies, we show that the evidence supports a shared FMF pattern in all the crocodilian species for which enough data are available. We find that such pattern changes between species and at different latitudes. These results suggest a lability of the FMF crocodilian sex-determination pattern, a key feature under the present climate change scenario.},

These pathological conditions involve interactions between environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors. Recent advances in nutriepigenomics are contributing to clarify the role of some nutritional factors, including dietary fatty acids in gene expression regulation. This systematic review assesses currently available information concerning the role of the different fatty acids on epigenetic mechanisms that affect the development of chronic diseases or induce protective effects on metabolic alterations. METHODS: A targeted search was conducted in the PubMed/Medline databases using the keywords "fatty acids and epigenetic". The data were analyzed according to the PRISMA-P guidelines. RESULTS: Consumption fatty acids like n-3 PUFA: EPA and DHA, and MUFA: oleic and palmitoleic acid was associated with an improvement of metabolic alterations. On the other hand, fatty acids that have been associated with the presence or development of obesity, T2D, pro-inflammatory profile, atherosclerosis and IR were n-6 PUFA, saturated fatty acids (stearic and palmitic), and trans fatty acids (elaidic), have been also linked with epigenetic changes. CONCLUSIONS: Fatty acids can regulate gene expression by modifying epigenetic mechanisms and consequently result in positive or negative impacts on metabolic outcomes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Recently, the field of tissue engineering has made numerous advances towards achieving artificial tendon substitutes with excellent mechanical and histological properties, and has had some promising experimental results. The purpose of this systematic review is to assess the efficacy of tissue engineering in the treatment of tendon injuries. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for the time period 1999 to 2016 for trials investigating tissue engineering used to improve tendon healing in animal models. The studies were screened for inclusion based on randomization, controls, and reported measurable outcomes. The RevMan software package was used for the meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 388 references were retrieved and 35 studies were included in this systematic review. The different biomaterials developed were analyzed and we found that they improve the biomechanical and histological characteristics of the repaired tendon. At meta-analysis, despite a high heterogeneity, it revealed a statistically significant effect in favour of the maximum load, the maximum stress, and the Young's modulus between experimental and control groups. In the forest plot, the diamond was on the right side of the vertical line and did not intersect with the line, favouring experimental groups. CONCLUSIONS: This review of the literature demonstrates the heterogeneity in the tendon tissue engineering literature.

The current systematic review is the first to evaluate empirical studies examining the construct of "food addiction" in humans and animals. Studies were included if they were quantitative, peer-reviewed, and in the English language. The 52 identified studies (35 articles) were qualitatively assessed to determine the extent to which their findings indicated the following addiction characteristics in relation to food: brain reward dysfunction, preoccupation, risky use, impaired control, tolerance/withdrawal, social impairment, chronicity, and relapse. Each pre-defined criterion was supported by at least one study. Brain reward dysfunction and impaired control were supported by the largest number of studies (n = 21 and n = 12, respectively); whereas risky use was supported by the fewest (n = 1). Overall, findings support food addiction as a unique construct consistent with criteria for other substance use disorder diagnoses. The evidence further suggests that certain foods, particularly processed foods with added sweeteners and fats, demonstrate the greatest addictive potential. Though both behavioral and substance-related factors are implicated in the addictive process, symptoms appear to better fit criteria for substance use disorder than behavioral addiction. Future research should explore social/role impairment, preoccupation, and risky use associated with food addiction and evaluate potential interventions for prevention and treatment.},

This paper systematically reviews the scientific literature regarding whether non-animal origin ingredients of commercial swine feed could introduce or transmit viral pathogens of swine into or within the United States. The purpose of this review is to identify, evaluate, and summarize the relevant scientific knowledge, published through March 2018, and to identify information gaps and research needs, thereby making the available evidence more accessible to policy makers, the swine industry, and the scientific community. A total of 26 documents were selected for the final review process, which included experimental studies, case reports, epidemiological investigations, and scientific opinion, among others. The review found that the scientific literature has addressed some critical experimental questions pertaining to transmission of swine viruses via feed and feed ingredients, but the current body of scientific knowledge lacks conclusive evidence of virus contamination of non-animal origin feed ingredients of commercial swine feed, particularly for imported commodities, and further investigation into the epidemiology of virus transmission via feed to swine under field conditions through natural feeding behavior is warranted. Additional studies of how imported ingredients of commercial swine feed are sourced, processed, transported and, thus, contaminated prior to importation into the United States are needed. Moving forward, studies designed to examine the likely source(s) of contamination and subsequent virus mitigation steps in processing and post-processing may be the most fruitful focus of research.},

	abstract = {Hymenolepis nana, as a neglected zoonotic helminth, naturally occurs in both humans and rodents. Herein, a systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out to estimate pooled prevalence of H. nana infection among human and rodent hosts for the first time in Iran. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase databases (English articles) and SID and Magiran databases (Persian articles) were systematically searched for relevant studies published from inception till May 24, 2020. Chi(2) and I(2) index were used to assess the heterogeneity of the included studies. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's intercept and visual inspection of the funnel plot. Pooled prevalence was estimated using random-effects model with 95 \% confidence interval (CI) and depicted as a forest plot. STATA software was used for analysis. The overall pooled prevalence estimate of H. nana in humans included 1.2 \% (95 \% CI = 1.0-1.4\%). Subgroup analysis revealed 2.2 \% (95 \% CI = 1.8-2.6\%) and 0.5 \% (95 \% CI = 0.3 to 0.8 \%) of H. nana infection among school children and food handlers, respectively. In terms of rodent hosts, the overall pooled prevalence of H. nana infection included 13 \% (95 \% CI = 9.3-16.6\%). Subgroup analysis revealed the highest rate of the infection was in Rattus spp. (19.6 \%; 95 \% CI = 10.6-28.6\%), a genus with synanthropic behavior. It seems, despite the advancement in sanitation infrastructure and hygiene status, the H. nana infection compares to other helminthic diseases remains a challenging public health problem in Iran.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been an increased focus on antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) within the animal health domain (World Health Organization, 2015; O'Neill, 2016). Evidence of the effectiveness of interventions designed to enhance AMS is essential to support the development of this practice. This scoping review summarises for the first time the extent, range, and nature of global research activity on approaches for improving AMS in farmers and veterinarians involved in livestock farm animal management, health \& well-being. METHODS: In November 2017 AGRICOLA, CAB Abstracts, EMBASE, MEDLINE, VetsRev and the Web of Science were searched. Studies were selected by two reviewers with 30 \% of excluded and all included studies being independently reviewed by another reviewer. Inclusion criteria were primary studies or literature reviews focusing on antimicrobial use (AMU) in farming or veterinary practices for food-producing animals. Outcomes were changes in, or factors influencing farmers' or veterinarians' AMS. Exclusion criteria were studies on wild or companion animals or reports of the level of, rather influencing factors for AMS, or knowledge/awareness related to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Study characteristics and relevant outcomes were extracted, identified facilitators and barriers grouped into categories, and a narrative synthesis was conducted. The PRISMA checklist extension for scoping reviews was used to guide the reporting of the review. RESULTS: 52 studies were included in the review; seven were intervention studies and 45 were studies of facilitators and barriers of AMU or antimicrobial prescribing (AMP). Studies were predominantly from high-income countries with only seven studies from low- or middle-income countries. Evidence for effective interventions was limited in terms of number of studies and robustness of evidence. There was some effect for an educational intervention in European cattle farmers and the Yellow Card scheme for Danish pig farmers. Significant facilitators to veterinarians' prudent AMP, in the cattle and pig livestock sector, included education, veterinarians' positive attitudes towards AMU reduction, and diagnostic. For farmers, significant facilitators to reduction of AMU were most frequently related to farming management practices. CONCLUSION: This review describes a scarcity of robust study designs and recommendations can be confidently made for better designed studies. Furthermore, greater consideration needs to be given to the outcome measures used in such studies. Nevertheless, the review summarises the evidence on the effectiveness of interventions and significant facilitators to farmers' and veterinarians' AMS, which can provide best currently available evidence to guide improvements in different livestock sectors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several case series and case reports have been published about idiopathic hydrocephalus treatment in dogs and cats using ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPS). OBJECTIVES: To determine the risk and type of complications in dogs and cats after VPS placement. ANIMALS: Sixteen papers were included. Sixty dogs and 13 cats with idiopathic hydrocephalus treated by VPS placement were identified. METHODS: The databases CAB, Scopus, and Medline were used. Idiopathic/congenital hydrocephalus, feline/canine patients, ventriculoperitoneal shunting, complications, and outcomes were inclusion criteria. The focus was on complication type and time frame within which they arose. RESULTS: Complications in dogs (n = 60) were shunt obstruction (6/60; 10\%), pain (4/60; 5.5\%), shunt infection (3/60; 4.1\%), disconnection (3/60; 4.1\%), excessive shunting (2/60; 2.7\%), and kinking (1/60; 1.6\%). Complications in cats (n = 13) were coiling of the shunt in the SC tissue (2/13; 15.4\%); kinking (1/13; 7.7\%); and shunt obstruction (1/13; 7.7\%). Complications were most likely during the first 6 months after shunt placement. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Ventriculoperitoneal shunting is considered a viable treatment option for patients with hydrocephalus. Potential complications should be discussed with the owner. Early diagnosis of complications is essential.},

	doi = {10.1086/701124},
	abstract = {Assortative mating in animals can have substantial evolutionary impact. Numerous reports also make it appear to be pervasive in occurrence. In assortative mating, defined here in behavioral terms, animals select their mates according to a particular shared trait such that mated individuals phenotypically resemble each other more than expected by chance. Body size is a widely studied assortment trait. This is especially relevant for anuran amphibians (frogs and toads), among whom reproductive advantages may accrue to large individuals of both sexes. Anurans also exhibit discrete forms of male mating behavior. Sedentary calling behavior of "sitters" allows for female choice, whereas fighting for possession of mates by "scramblers" precludes female choice. Size-assortative mating in anurans should therefore be a property of sitters, not scramblers. I used meta-analysis to assess the occurrence of true size-assortative mating in relation to mating behavior and other variables in 282 studies of 68 species of anurans. I found publication bias against reporting nonsignificant results and analytical bias resulting from pooling of samples collected at different times or places (Simpson's paradox). Pooled samples significantly inflated the apparent occurrence and strength of size-assortative mating. Controlling for such biases left little credible evidence for size-assortative mating behavior in any anurans. Instead, large-male advantage among scramblers was associated with a secondary pattern of concomitant nonrandom mating. In this disproportionate mating, neither sex behaves according to mate choice rules that could lead to consistently strong assortment. It should thus have relatively little evolutionary impact compared to true assortative mating.},

Although COX-2 is the isoform most studied and has been described in several malignancies associated with histologic criteria of malignancy and worse prognosis, COX-1 has also been linked to some forms of cancer. With the present review our aim was to summarize the current state of knowledge and clarify if and in which type of tumours COX-1 and/or COX-2 expression have real prognostic implications. We searched PubMed database for prognostic studies using predefined inclusion criteria in order to ascertain the prognostic value of COX-1 and COX-2 in malignant neoplasia in dogs and cats. Eighteen studies were analysed. COX-2 was shown to be a negative prognostic factor in canine and feline mammary tumours, canine mast cell tumour, canine melanoma, canine osteosarcoma and canine renal cell carcinoma. COX-1 showed a negative prognostic value in feline oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We found high heterogeneity among studies regarding COX immunohistochemical evaluation methodology even in the same type of neoplasia pointing out the need for its standardization at least by tumour type. The available data support the use of COX-2 as a prognostic factor in canine (mammary carcinoma, mast cell tumour, melanoma, osteosarcoma and renal carcinoma) and feline (mammary carcinoma) cancers. For COX-1, its use is advised in feline oral SCC.},

The review aims to yield an overview of the contraction modalities influencing the SSC performance in animals and single joint movements in humans. The search was executed in common with the PRISMA statement. CINAHL, MEDLINE (via ProQuest), PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus and Web of Science databases were used for the systematic search from its inception until February 2019. A quality assessment was conducted with a modified Downs and Black checklist. Twenty-five studies were included. SSC effects, leading to increased force/work during a SSC and a reduced force depression (FD) compared to a pure shortening contraction, are existent on different levels of the muscle, from single fiber experiments to the level of in vivo muscle-tendon complex. Muscle performance is dependent on shortening velocity, shortening distance, stretch distance, the time (transition phase) between stretch and shortening and the active prephase duration. Concerning stretch velocity we found conflicting results. The findings from this systematic review indicate that the mechanisms in the early phase of shortening are associated with pre-activation effects, elastic recoil and stretch reflex. Furthermore, we speculate that residual force enhancement (RFE) is mainly responsible for an increased steady-state force compared to a pure shortening contraction.},

Recent reports confirm the emergence and outbreaks of leptospirosis in the Pacific Islands, but the epidemiology and drivers of transmission of human and animal leptospirosis are poorly documented, especially in the more isolated and less developed islands. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a systematic review of human and animal leptospirosis within 25 Pacific Islands (PIs) in Polynesia, Melanesia, Micronesia, as well as Easter Island and Hawaii. We performed a literature search using four international databases for articles published between January 1947 and June 2017. We further included grey literature available on the internet. We identified 148 studies describing leptospirosis epidemiology, but the number of studies varied significantly between PIs. No data were available from four PIs. Human leptospirosis has been reported from 13 PIs, with 63\% of all studies conducted in Hawaii, French Polynesia and New Caledonia. Animal leptospirosis has been investigated in 19 PIs and from 14 host species, mainly pigs (18\% of studies), cattle (16\%) and dogs (11\%). Only 13 studies provided information on both human and animal leptospirosis from the same location. Serology results were highly diverse in the region, both in humans and animals. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study suggests that, as in other tropical regions, leptospirosis is widespread in the PIs while showing some epidemiological heterogeneity. Data are scarce or absent from many PIs. Rodents, cattle, pigs and dogs are all likely to be important carriers, but the relative importance of each animal species in human infection needs to be clarified. Epidemiological surveys with appropriate sampling design, pathogen typing and data analysis are needed to improve our understanding of transmission patterns and to develop effective intervention strategies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) in young adults is a challenging disorder that can impairs the quality of life of a patient. The disease also leads to frequent occurrences of collapse of the femoral head and resultant dysfunction of the hip joint. In recent years, some scholars have studied steroid-induced lipid metabolism disorder and achieved the effect of steroid-induced ONFH treatment. This study aims to review the investigations on the hepatic CYP3A (cytochrome P4503A enzyme) genetic polymorphisms in steroid-induced ONFH patients. We then further explore its activity correlation with the development of steroid-induced ONFH in a rabbit model. METHODS: A systematic literature search of articles was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Springerlink, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure database up to February 2017. Twelve relevant articles were retrieved. The odds ratios, standard mean difference, and 95\% confidence intervals were calculated to assess the effect of hepatic CYP3A activity on the rabbit model with steroid-induced ONFH. Fixed-effects and random-effects models were used to analyze the heterogeneity. Begg's funnel plot was used to assess publication bias. RESULTS: High hepatic CYP3A activity significantly decreased the risk for steroid-induced ONFH in the rabbit model (p {\textless}. 05). The CYP3A gene may be potentially associated with increased risk of steroid-induced ONFH in the human allele model. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that high hepatic CYP3A activity decreases the risk of steroid-induced ONFH.},

	abstract = {Background: There is accumulating evidence showing that exercise therapy may play an active role in peripheral neuropathic pain (NP). However, there have been no meta-analysis to investigate the effects of exercise on NP induced by peripheral nerve injury in rat models. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched from inception to January 2019. A random-effect model was implemented to provide effect estimates for pain-related behavioral test outcome. Mean differences (MDs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: Fourteen studies were included. For the mechanical withdrawal threshold, rats in the exercised group exhibited significantly higher thresholds than those in the control group, with a MD of 0.91 (95\% CI 0.11-1.71), 3.11 (95\% CI 1.56-4.66), 3.48 (95\% CI 2.70-4.26), 4.16 (95\% CI 2.53-5.79), and 5.58 (95\% CI 3.44-7.73) at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks, respectively. Additionally, thermal withdrawal latency increased in the exercised group compared with the control group, with a MD of 2.48 (95\% CI 0.59-4.38), 3.57 (95\% CI 2.10-5.05), 3.92 (95\% CI 2.82-5.03), and 2.84 (95\% CI 1.29-4.39) at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks, respectively. Subgroup analyses were performed for pain models, exercise start point, exercise forms, and duration, which decreased heterogeneity to some extent. Conclusion: This meta-analysis indicated that exercise provoked an increase in mechanical withdrawal threshold and thermal withdrawal latency in animal NP models. Exercise therapy may be a promising non-pharmacologic therapy to prevent the development of NP. Further, preclinical studies focused on improving experiment design and reporting are still needed.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To systematically review the available preclinical evidence of adult stem cells as a biological augmentation in the treatment of animal anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: PubMed (MEDLINE) and Embase were searched for the eligible studies. The inclusion criteria were controlled animal trials of adult stem cells used in ACL treatment (repair or reconstruction). Studies of natural ACL healing without intervention, in vitro studies, ex vivo studies, and studies without controls were excluded. Evidence level, methodologic quality, and risk of bias of each included study were identified using previously established tools. RESULTS: Thirteen animal studies were included. Six of 7 studies using bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (BMSCs) reported a positive enhancement in histology, biomechanics, and biochemistry within 12 weeks postoperatively. Four studies using ACL-derived vascular stem cells showed a promoting effect in histology, biomechanics, and imaging within 8 weeks postoperatively. Two studies focusing on animal tendon-derived stem cells (TDSCs) and human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) reported promotable effects for the early healing in a small animal ACL model. CONCLUSIONS: BMSCs, ACL-derived vascular stem cells, TDSCs, and hUCB-MSCs were shown to enhance the healing of ACL injury during the early phase in small animal models. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results of clinical trials using adult stem cells in ACL treatment are conflicting, and a systematic review of the current best preclinical evidence is crucial to guide further application.},

	abstract = {For pig somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), artificial activation to trigger development can improve efficiency. However, because timing is key to activation, delayed activation is controversial. Two oocyte activation procedures are available: those that occur immediately after fusion and those that take place several hours after fusion. Both methods are successful for generating SCNT fetuses. We studied whether delayed activation is associated with pig SCNT embryo development. We searched the literature for publications from 2000 to 2018 and identified 1109 studies, 8 of which we included in a meta-analysis. A Higgins statistic was used to measure heterogeneity. Delayed activation enhanced embryo cleavage (OR=0.73, 95\% CI 0.61-0.87) and blastocyst formation (OR=0.79, 95\% CI 0.65-0.97) significantly and offered the same quality pig SCNT embryo (OR=-0.03, 95\% CI -3.12-3.05). The Egger method and Begg's test were used to estimate publication bias, and there was none (Pr {\textgreater} , z, =1). The most commonly used pig embryo media are NCSU-23 and PZM. Studies suggest that each offers unique advantages. Culture medium influences cleavage heterogeneity, and NCSU-23 can increase cleavage. Delayed time causes blastocyst heterogeneity; if the delay exceeds 1 h of activation, blastocyst formation improves. If the delay does not exceed 30 min, blastocyst formation decreases. Donor nuclei and recipient oocyte cytoplasm require a period of adaptation for chromatin remodeling and reprogramming. The timing of these events depends on maternal factors in the recipient oocyte cytoplasm. Thus, recipient oocyte cytoplasm requires time to mix with donor cytoplasm. Then, maternal factors can be added after donor nuclei are added. New nuclei may shuttle mRNA to the cytoplasm, and this can cause chromatin remodeling and reprogramming. Thus, future SCNT studies should focus on delay of activation timing.},

	abstract = {Salmonellosis is a leading cause of foodborne illnesses in humans with cattle being one of the reservoirs for Salmonella. We estimated a pooled prevalence of Salmonella in apparently healthy cattle and examined serotype diversity through systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published between 2000 and 2017. Peer reviewed publications reporting the prevalence of Salmonella in cattle were searched through five electronic databases (PubMed, Google scholar, Agricola, Scopus, CAB direct) and through manual search. We obtained 71 publications with 75 datasets consisting a total of 52,766 animals examined and 5,010 Salmonella positive cattle from 29 countries in six continents (except from Antarctica). Pooled prevalence of Salmonella in cattle was 9\% (95\% confidence interval: 7-11\%). Significantly high heterogeneity (I (2) = 98.7\%, P {\textless} 0.01) was observed among all studies as well as within continents. Prevalence varied from 2\% (Europe) to 16\% (North America). Overall, 143 different serotypes were reported with the most diverse serotypes being reported from Africa (76 different serotypes) followed by North America (49 serotypes). The 10 most frequently reported serotypes (Montevideo, Typhimurium, Kentucky, Meleagridis, Anatum, Cerro, Mbandaka, Muenster, Newport, and Senftenberg) accounted for 65\% of the isolates for which specific serotype information was reported. Salmonella Montevideo and S. Dublin are the most frequently reported serotypes in North America and Europe, respectively, while S. Typhimurium was the most frequent in Africa, Asia and Australasia. Our results indicated variability both in the prevalence and serotype diversity of Salmonella in cattle across continents. Although all Salmonella serotypes are potentially pathogenic to humans, five (Montevideo, Typhimurium, Anatum, Mbandaka, and Newport) of the top 10 serotypes identified in this study are among the serotypes most commonly associated with clinical illnesses in humans.},

	abstract = {Acrobatic exercise is considered a complex motor activity and may promote motor learning and neuroplasticity. The objective of this systematic review was to verify possible plastic brain changes induced by acrobatic exercise in non-lesioned rat and mouse through the analysis of experimental studies. Manual and electronic searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE and ISI Web of Science databases, without restriction to language or publication date. Synaptogenesis and neurogenesis were selected as the primary outcomes. To evaluate the risk of bias of individual studies, we used the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) RoB tool. We found 1780 studies, from which 18 fulfilled the inclusion criteria in this review. Seventeen studies evaluated the cerebellum, six the motor cortex, five the striatum and two evaluated the hippocampus. The results showed that acrobatic exercise promotes plastic changes in brain areas of rats, and such changes are dependent of training frequency and duration. However, studies were heterogeneous regarding the proteins analyzed and the training protocols, which made it difficult to compare and determine ideal acrobatic exercise parameters for neuroplasticity. Concerning the methodological quality of studies, most of them presented high risk of bias with absence of relevant study design information. New research with detailing training protocols and analysis might contribute to clarify the role of acrobatic exercise in neuroplasticity and how it could be used in translational research.},

	abstract = {Dengue is a rapidly spreading mosquito-borne flavivirus infection that is prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Humans are known to be the main reservoir host maintaining the epidemic cycles of dengue but it is unclear if dengue virus is also maintained in a similar enzootic cycle. The systematic review was conducted in accordance to Cochrane's PRISMA recommendations. A search was done on PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and Cochrane Library. Key data on animal dengue positivity was extracted and classified according to animal type and diagnostic modes. Of the 3818 articles identified, 56 articles were used in this review. A total of 16,333 animals were tested, 1817 of which were positive for dengue virus by RT-PCR or serology. Dengue positivity was detected in bats (10.1\%), non-human primates (27.3\%), birds (11\%), bovid (4.1\%), dogs (1.6\%), horses (5.1\%), pigs (34.1\%), rodents (3.5\%), marsupials (13\%) and other small animals (7.3\%). While majority of dengue positivity via serology suggests potential enzootic transmission, but regular dengue virus spillback cannot be excluded. With the exception of bats, acute infection among animals is limited. Further investigation on animals is critically required to better understand their role as potential reservoir in dengue transmission.},

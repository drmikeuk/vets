	abstract = {Inactivated Parapoxvirus ovis (iPPVO) and Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) are currently used in equine medicine as immune-modulators for prophylactic treatment or adjunct to conventional therapy in order to improve immune defences, to prevent or treat infectious diseases. Their mode of action relies on a non-antigen specific interaction with the innate and/or adaptive immune responses. iPPVO stimulates and regulates cytokine secretion by leucocytes, while P. acnes acts primarily through the activation of macrophages. This report aims to describe their activity as immune-modulators and to summarise the scientific literature and reports available about their use in horses, particularly in the prevention or treatment of equine respiratory diseases. This systematic review regroups articles published in peer-review journals, clinical trials reports, conference proceedings and other information made available in the last 2 decades.},

	abstract = {To evaluate the efficacy of melatonin implants on increasing the production of lambs, a meta-analysis was performed based on the results of 139 experiments carried out in Spain and published in 56 scientific publications or conference proceedings. To assess the effects on fertility, the relative risk (RR) was calculated and, in the case of prolificacy and fecundity, the analysis was based on raw mean difference (\_D\_) and the standardized difference between means (\_d\_) and their corresponding confidence intervals. In addition, the experiments were stratified by the productive aptitude of the flocks, breed, time of year, and age. For fertility, the mean RR was 1.29, which indicated that the treatment with melatonin increased significantly (by 29\%) the probability of pregnancy. For prolificacy, overall \_D\_ was 0.08 (\_d\_=0.9089); \_i.e.\_, the groups treated with melatonin increased their litter size by 0.08 lambs/lambing relative to the control groups. Ultimately, treatment with melatonin increased fecundity significantly (0.25 extra lambs/ewe treated) (\_d\_=6.3188), and this trend was evident in all of the stratified datasets. In all cases, there was significant (\_p\_{\textless}0.001) heterogeneity and bias. In conclusion, in Spain, melatonin implants had a significant effect on the probability that a ewe became pregnant, increased the number of lambs born per lambing, which ultimately increased the number of lambs born per treated ewe. In addition to confirm the results of previous descriptive reviews in the scientific literature, the metaanalysis made use of a statistical tool that synthesizes and estimates more precisely the effect of this hormone on sheep reproduction.},

In addition to careful horse farm management, vaccination is the only known alternative to reduce the RVA associated disease burden on horse farms. The precise evaluation of vaccine effectiveness against circulating strains needs enhanced surveillance of equine RVAs in areas where vaccine is already available or vaccine introduction is anticipated. Therefore, we undertook the overview of relevant information on epidemiology of equine RVA strains through systematic search of public literature databases. Our findings indicated that over 99\% of equine RVA strains characterized during the past three decades belonged to two common genotypes, G3P[12] and G14P[12], whereas most of the minority equine RVA strains were probably introduced from a heterologous host by interspecies transmission. These baseline data on RVA strains in horses shall contribute to a better understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of strain prevalence in vaccinated and non-vaccinated herds.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the published literature for controlled studies comparing learning outcomes of traditional methods that require the terminal use of animals (eg, dissection, live-animal surgery, and live-animal laboratory demonstrations) with outcomes obtained with alternative teaching methods. DESIGN: Systematic review. STUDY POPULATION: Controlled studies published between 1996 and 2004. PROCEDURES: PubMed was searched with the following keywords, used alone and in combination: educational alternatives, nonlethal teaching methods, veterinary alternatives, medical education, and nonterminal animal use. Cited references of retrieved reports were reviewed to identify additional reports. Reports were selected for review only if a comparison group was included. RESULTS: 17 studies that were randomized controlled trials or nonrandomized trials that included a comparison group were identified. Five involved veterinary students, 3 involved medical students, 6 involved university undergraduate students, and 3 involved high school biology students. Sample size ranged from 14 to 283 students. Eleven studies appeared to be randomized, parallel-group trials, 4 involved comparative groups to which participants were not randomly assigned or for which the randomization process was not clear, 1 was a 2-period crossover study, and 1 involved a retrospective review of grades. In all 17 studies reviewed, results associated with the alternative method of instruction were not significantly different from or superior to results associated with the conventional method. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although the number of controlled studies identified was small, the results seem to support more widespread adoption of alternative teaching methods in biomedical education.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis of published studies was used to investigate the effect of rumen-protected methionine (RPM) added to the diets of lactating dairy cattle on dry matter intake, milk production, true milk protein (TMP) production, and milk fat yield. Differences in responses between 2 commonly used RPM products, Mepron (Evonik Industries, Hanau, Germany) and Smartamine (Adisseo, Antony, France), were investigated as well as dietary and animal factors that could influence responses. Diets were coded with respect to the amino acid (AA) deficiency of the control diet as predicted by the AminoCow model (version 3.5.2, http://www.makemilknotmanure.com/aminocow.php; 0=no AA deficiency, 1=Met deficiency, 2=Met and Lys deficiency, 3=Met and Lys plus at least 1 other AA deficiency) to test the effect of AA deficiencies on RPM response. Thirty-five studies were identified, 17 studies evaluating Mepron, 18 studies evaluating Smartamine, and 1 study evaluating both. This permitted 75 dietary comparisons between control and RPM-added diets. Diets were entered into the AminoCow and the 2001 National Research Council models to compare predictions of Met, Lys, and metabolizable protein (MP) flow. Mean Met and Lys in diets where RPM was fed were estimated to be 2.35 and 6.33\% of MP, respectively. Predictions of flows between models were similar. Overall, RPM addition to diets increased production of TMP, both as percentage (0.07\%) and yield (27 g/d). Dry matter intake and milk fat percentage were slightly decreased, whereas milk production was slightly increased. Differences between products were detected for all production variables, with Mepron-fed cows producing less TMP percentage but greater milk production, resulting in twice as much TMP yield. Milk protein response to RPM was not related to predicted AA deficiency, calculated Met deficiency, or Met as a percentage of MP. Other dietary factors, including Lys flow (g/d), Lys as percentage of MP, neutral detergent fiber percentage, crude protein percentage, or energy balance, had no detectable effects on TMP response. When cows with a predicted positive AA balance were fed RPM, milk production increased, but when AA balance was negative, milk production decreased. Amount of RPM added to the diet was not correlated to TMP response. This study does not support the necessity of a high Lys level as a prerequisite to obtaining a TMP response to feeding RPM or the MP requirement suggested by the National Research Council model (2001). However, more dose-response studies over a wide range of milk production and dietary regimens will be required to more clearly establish AA requirements and to predict responses to RPM supplementation.},

	abstract = {Cyathostomins are the most important gastrointestinal nematode infecting equids. Their effective control is currently under threat due to widespread resistance to the broad spectrum anthelmintics licenced for use in equids. In response to similar resistance issues in other helminths, there has been increasing interest in alternative control strategies, such as bioactive plant compounds derived from traditional ethnoveterinary treatments. This study used an evidence-based approach to evaluate the potential use of plant extracts from the UK and Ethiopia to treat cyathostomins. Plants were shortlisted based on findings from a literature review and additionally, in Ethiopia, the results of a participatory rural appraisal (PRA) in the Oromia region of the country. Systematic selection criteria were applied to both groups to identify five Ethiopian and four UK plants for in vitro screening. These included Acacia nilotica (L.) Delile, Cucumis prophetarum L., Rumex abyssinicus Jacq., Vernonia amygdalina Delile. and Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal from Ethiopia and Allium sativum L. (garlic), Artemisia absinthium L., Chenopodium album L. and Zingiber officinale Roscoe. (ginger) from the UK. Plant material was collected, dried and milled prior to hydro-alcoholic extraction. Crude extracts were dissolved in distilled water (dH2O) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), serially diluted and screened for anthelmintic activity in the larval migration inhibition test (LMIT) and the egg hatch test (EHT). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to identify extracts that had a significant effect on larval migration and/or egg hatch, compared to non-treated controls. The median effective concentration (EC-50) for each extract was calculated using PROBIT analysis. Of the Ethiopian extracts A. nilotica, R. abyssinicus and C. prophetarum showed significant anthelmintic activity. Their lowest EC-50 values were 0.18 (confidence interval (CI): 0.1-0.3), 1.1 (CI 0.2-2.2) and 1.1 (CI 0.9-1.4)mg/ml, respectively. All four UK extracts, A. sativum, C. album, Z. officinale and A. absinthium, showed significant anthelmintic activity. Their lowest EC-50 values were 1.1 (CI 0.9-1.3), 2.3 (CI 1.9-2.7) and 0.3 (CI 0.2-0.4)mg/ml, respectively. Extract of A. absinthium had a relatively low efficacy and the data did not accurately fit a PROBIT model for the dose response relationship, thus an EC-50 value was not calculated. Differences in efficacy for each extract were noted, dependent on the assay and solvent used, highlighting the need for a systematic approach to the evaluation of bioactive plant compounds. This study has identified bioactive plant extracts from the UK and Ethiopia which have potential as anthelmintic forages or feed supplements in equids.},

Since the establishment of the etiologic role of L. intracellularis, a number of specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have been developed for the detection of DNA in feces. The present article is a systematic review of peer-reviewed publications on the application of L. intracellularis-specific fecal PCR as an antemortem diagnostic test for histologic lesions of PE in pigs. Based on this information, a range of diagnostic sensitivities (36-100\%) and specificities (50-100\%) of the published tests was calculated. Validity and confidence limits of the estimates varied considerably. The positive and negative predictive values of 6 different PCR assays were calculated for PE prevalence of 15\%, 30\%, 45\%, 60\%, 75\%, and 90\%, using a histologic case definition of PE and based on the reported test sensitivities and specificities. The simulated predictive values suggested that applying the fecal PCR assay as a diagnostic test is more likely to overestimate than underestimate the number of pigs having histologic lesions of PE under field conditions.},

METHODS: A systematic review found original studies in the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS up to November 2012 and in complementary sources up to February 2013. Studies were evaluated in accordance with QUADAS 2 and STARD parameters and recommended in accordance with GRADE parameters. Meta-analysis was carried out with MetaDiSc software, using the random effect model. RESULTS: 284 studies were identified, of which 25 met the inclusion criteria, comprising the final synthesis. All but one were done in Brazil, and only 2 were judged to be of good quality. 15 studies involving immuno-enzymatic tests with crude antigens (cELISA), 11 studies on indirect immunofluorescence tests (IFAT) and 3 on the immunochromatographic dual path platform (DPP) test were meta-analysed. The combined results for sensitivity and specificity were: cELISA: 0.89 (CI 95\% 0.87 to 0.91) and 0.87 (CI 95\% 0.86 to 0.88); IFAT: 0.88 (CI 95\% 0.85 to 0.91) and 0.63 (CI 95\% 0.61 to 0.65) and DPP: 0.83 (CI 95\% 0.78 to 0.88) and 0.73 (CI 95\% 0.70 to 0.75). CONCLUSION: cELISA and DPP tests have moderate accuracy for the diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis, and the quality of the design, implementation and analysis of validation studies on diagnostic tests for this disease urgently require improvement. The recommendation for use of the evaluated tests is based on evidence that is scarce and restricted to Brazil.},

The experimental design, methodological quality, type of vaccine and results of the studies were analyzed. Twenty-four papers were selected for this review. In general, bacterin-toxoid vaccines, vaccines of DNA-recombinant protein and recombinant protein alone were investigated in the studies selected. This systematic review suggests that vaccines that employ new technologies (DNA and/or recombinant protein vaccines) and some long-standing bacterins have achieved good results, which supports their use in the prevention and control of bovine mastitis caused by S. aureus.

	abstract = {Daily pasture allowance (PA) is defined as the product of pregrazing pasture mass and offered area, and is the major grazing management factor determining pasture utilization per unit area and daily performance of grazing dairy cows. The objective of the present study was to perform a meta-analysis reviewing the effect of PA on pasture intake, milk production, milk composition, and grazing behavior of dairy cows. Experiments studying the effect of PA on pasture intake or milk production, which eventually included milk composition or grazing behavior data, or both, were selected to create a database. Papers were selected only if at least 2 PA were compared under the same experimental conditions, particularly the same pasture mass (i.e., where PA levels were only obtained through changes in daily offered area). The final database included 97 PA comparisons reported in 56 papers. For analytical purposes, the database was subdivided into 3 subsets that varied according to the estimation height (EH) at which PA was determined; that is, PA above ground level (PA0 subset), PA above 2.5 to 3.5cm (PA3 subset), and PA above 4 to 5cm (PA5 subset). Statistical analyses were conducted independently on the PA0, PA3, and PA5 subsets and on the whole database (global analysis) by using linear and nonlinear mixed-model procedures. The curves, either exponential, quadratic, or linear, describing the effects of PA on pasture intake, milk production, or grazing behavior of dairy cows are conceptually similar, whatever the EH. The equations describing these curves are, however, specific for each EH. Accordingly, from typical low to high PA, the increase in pasture intake (0.13 vs. 0.21 vs. 0.28kg/kg of PA), milk production (0.11 vs. 0.17 vs. 0.24kg/kg of PA), and milk solids production (0.008 vs. 0.010 vs. 0.013kg/kg of PA) per kilogram of increase in PA was lower for PA0 than for PA3, and for PA3 than for PA5. Grazing time increased from low to medium PA and did not vary from medium to high PA. Pasture intake rate seemed to increase from low to medium PA because of greater bite mass, whereas it increased from medium to high PA because of greater biting rate. The present meta-analysis demonstrated that the general relationship between PA and any dependent variable is quite strong and independent of EH. This suggests no specific relationship for some parts of the world or methodology approach, with a high portability of the global equations calculated here. These results are useful for improving grazing management and modeling on pasture-based dairy systems.},

An interaction between PM and estimation height was found for pasture intake and milk production in the global analysis. On the basis of the predictive equations, pasture intake increased by 1.58 kg of dry matter/d per tonne increase in PM when PM were compared at SPA(0), was not affected by PM when PM were compared at SPA(3), and decreased by 0.65 kg of dry matter/d per tonne increase in PM when PM were compared at SPA(5). This is consistent with the effect of PM on milk production, which was positive and negative (1.04 and -0.79 kg/t of PM, respectively) when PM were compared at SPA(0) and SPA(5), respectively. Grazing time was only slightly affected by PM, irrespective of estimation height, because the effect of PM on pasture intake was mainly dependent on the variation in pasture intake rate. Pasture intake rate increased with increasing PM at SPA(0) but decreased with increasing PM at SPA(5). This meta-analysis clearly demonstrates that the effects of PM on pasture intake, milk production, and behavior of strip-grazing dairy cows depend largely on the height at which the PM and pasture allowance are measured. These results have methodological implications for future grazing research because it can be recommended that PM be compared at similar levels of pasture availability (i.e., at the same pasture allowance above 2 to 3 cm) to avoid possible misinterpretations of results. They also reveal the benefits of improving grazing management and intake prediction through modeling in pasture-based dairy systems.},

We wished to investigate whether a consolidated estimate of the response could be quantified. Therefore we conducted a meta-analysis of the available data, 19 studies from 14 published papers, on the effect of GnRH analogs on pregnancy rate when given between Days 11 and 14 after first insemination. Odds ratios (the relative probability of pregnancy between treated and control cows) were compared for each study and found to vary significantly among studies, ranging from 0 to 22\%. We showed by logistic regression analysis that response to GnRH treatment varied with cow type (beef or dairy), age (cow or heifer), estrus synchronization (synchronized or natural), pregnancy diagnosis (method and time) and effect of individual study. When all these variables were included only 6 of 14 publications could be analyzed, representing 2,541 instead of 10,945 cows. In this limited subgroup of data, a significant improvement in pregnancy rate was detected among treated cattle (odds ratio = 1.33; P{\textless}0.01).},

It was conducted in August 2007. Primary studies on causes of morbidity and mortality on smallholder dairy farms in the region were identified, examined and descriptive information extracted. Electronic (CAB Abstracts, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Web of Science) and non-electronic databases were used to identify and retrieve the primary studies. The retrieval process included all types of study designs with no restriction on the year of publication and language. Mastitis, tick-borne diseases (TBDs), tick infestation and diarrhoea were among the most commonly documented causes of morbidity. TBDs, diarrhoea and trypanosomiasis were among the most commonly documented causes of mortality; however, a substantial number of mortalities with undiagnosed causes were also reported. Factors ranked as most negatively associated with mastitis were residual calf suckling and increased water availability on the farm while use of common udder towel was the factor most positively associated with mastitis. Zero-grazing was ranked as the factor most negatively associated with TBDs while age was most positively associated. More intervention studies are recommended in the region to better identify animal health constraints and their associated risk factors.},

Treatment mean values were extracted from 68 peer-reviewed studies, including 306 feeding trials. The main criterion for inclusion of a study in the meta-analysis was that it reported, or permitted calculation of, energy efficiency (Eeff; energy in milk/digestible energy intake) and nitrogen efficiency (Neff; nitrogen in milk/digestible nitrogen intake) at the digestible level (digestible energy or digestible protein). The effect of nutritional and animal variables, including neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber (ADF), digestible energy, digestible protein, proportion of concentrate (PCO), dry matter intake, milk yield, days in milk, and body weight, on Eeff, Neff, and the Neff:Eeff ratio was analyzed using mixed models. The interstudy correlation between Eeff and Neff was 0.62, whereas the intrastudy correlation was 0.30. The higher interstudy correlation was partly due to milk yield and dry matter intake being present in both Eeff and Neff. We, therefore, also explored the Neff:Eeff ratio. Energy efficiency was negatively associated with ADF and PCO, whereas Neff was negatively associated with ADF and digestible energy. The Neff:Eeff ratio was affected by ADF and PCO only. In conclusion, the results indicate a possibility to maximize feed efficiency in terms of both energy and nitrogen at the same time. In other words, an improvement in Eeff would also mean an improvement in Neff. The current study also shows that these types of transverse data are not sufficient to study the effect of animal factors, such as days in milk, on feed efficiency. Longitudinal measurements per animal would probably be more appropriate.},

	abstract = {AIM: There are conflicting findings from observational studies regarding the nature of the association between hyperoxia and risk of mortality in patients admitted to intensive care following cardiac arrest. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates animal data investigating the effect of administration of high concentrations of oxygen following cardiac arrest on neurological outcome and the clinical applicability of this data. METHODS: A systematic search of Medline and Embase identified controlled animal studies modelling cardiac arrest with subsequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation that compared ventilation with 100\% oxygen to lower concentrations following return of spontaneous circulation. Eligible studies were included in a meta-analysis in which the inverse variance weighted differences were calculated for the standardised mean difference of the primary outcome measure, the neurological deficit score. RESULTS: Ten studies met the criteria for inclusion in the systematic review. In a meta-analysis of six studies, with 95 animals, treatment with 100\% oxygen resulted in a significantly worse neurological deficit score than oxygen administered at lower concentrations, with a standardised mean difference of -0.64 (95\% CI -1.06 to -0.22). In four of five studies, histological evidence of increased neuronal damage was present in animals that received 100\% oxygen therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of 100\% oxygen therapy is associated with worse neurological outcome than lower oxygen concentrations in animal models of cardiac arrest. However, due to limitations in study design and poor generalisability of the animal models to the situation of post cardiac arrest resuscitation in humans, the clinical applicability of this data is uncertain.},

	abstract = {Animal contact is a potential transmission route for campylobacteriosis, and both domestic household pet and petting zoo exposures have been identified as potential sources of exposure. Research has typically focussed on the prevalence, concentration, and transmission of zoonoses from farm animals to humans, yet there are gaps in our understanding of these factors among animals in contact with the public who don't live on or visit farms. This study aims to quantify, through a systematic review and meta-analysis, the prevalence and concentration of Campylobacter carriage in household pets and petting zoo animals. Four databases were accessed for the systematic review (PubMed, CAB direct, ProQuest, and Web of Science) for papers published in English from 1992-2012, and studies were included if they examined the animal population of interest, assessed prevalence or concentration with fecal, hair coat, oral, or urine exposure routes (although only articles that examined fecal routes were found), and if the research was based in Canada, USA, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Studies were reviewed for qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis by two reviewers, compiled into a database, and relevant studies were used to create a weighted mean prevalence value. There were insufficient data to run a meta-analysis of concentration values, a noted study limitation. The mean prevalence of Campylobacter in petting zoo animals is 6.5\% based on 7 studies, and in household pets the mean is 24.7\% based on 34 studies. Our estimated concentration values were: 7.65x103cfu/g for petting zoo animals, and 2.9x105cfu/g for household pets. These results indicate that Campylobacter prevalence and concentration are lower in petting zoo animals compared with household pets and that both of these animal sources have a lower prevalence compared with farm animals that do not come into contact with the public. There is a lack of studies on Campylobacter in petting zoos and/or fair animals in Canada and abroad. Within this literature, knowledge gaps were identified, and include: a lack of concentration data reported in the literature for Campylobacter spp. in animal feces, a distinction between ill and diarrheic pets in the reported studies, noted differences in shedding and concentrations for various subtypes of Campylobacter, and consistent reporting between studies.},

We have conducted a systematic review of studies investigating suicidal behaviour and psychosocial problems in veterinary surgeons. METHODS: A systematic search of the international research literature was performed in May 2008. Data from 52 studies of non-fatal suicidal behaviour, mental health difficulties, stress and burnout, occupational difficulties, and psychological characteristics of veterinary surgeons were extracted by two independent reviewers and analysed. Studies were rated for quality and greater emphasis placed on findings from higher quality studies. RESULTS: The majority of studies were of stress and occupational difficulties experienced by veterinary surgeons. Occupational stressors included managerial aspects of the job, long working hours, heavy workload, poor work-life balance, difficult client relations, and performing euthanasia. Few studies investigated suicidal behaviour or mental health difficulties in the profession. Some studies suggested that young and female veterinarians are at greatest risk of negative outcomes such as suicidal thoughts, mental health difficulties, and job dissatisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: The review highlights the difficulties faced by veterinary surgeons that may contribute to poor mental wellbeing and suicidal behaviour. Future research might include further examination of the influence of euthanasia on attitudes towards suicide and more direct examination of the impact that occupational risk factors might have on suicidal behaviour. Suggestions about the review's implications for suicide prevention in this group are also made.},

Identification of the occupations at risk, and the factors that contribute to the increased risk of suicide in these groups is essential for the development of effective suicide prevention strategies. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that veterinary surgeons are a group at risk. AIMS: To conduct a systematic review of studies of rates and methods of suicide in the veterinary profession. METHODS: A systematic search of the international research literature was performed in May 2008. The data from the 19 studies of the prevalence of suicide in the veterinary profession were extracted by two independent reviewers and analysed. RESULTS: Between 0 and 43\% of veterinary surgeon deaths were due to suicide. In all but one of the 15 studies presenting risk of suicide in veterinary surgeons with a comparison population, an elevated risk was found. The better quality studies with the lowest risk of bias indicated that in the UK, the rate of suicide in the veterinary profession was at least three times the general population rate. Studies of the methods of suicide veterinary surgeons use suggest that self-poisoning and firearms are particularly common. CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be an elevated risk of suicide for veterinary surgeons in several countries. Access to means of suicide influences the methods used and may contribute to increased risk.},

Progress towards minimizing both veterinary and financial impact of the disease will be made with targeted disease control policies. To move towards targeted control, specific targets and detailed control strategies must be defined. One approach for identifying targets is to use mathematical and simulation models quantified with accurate and fine-scale data to design and evaluate alternative control policies. Nevertheless, published models of FMDV vary in modelling techniques and resolution of data incorporated. In order to determine which models and data sources contain enough detail to represent realistic control policy alternatives, we performed a systematic literature review of all FMDV dynamical models that use host data, disease data or both data types. For the purpose of evaluating modelling methodology, we classified models by control strategy represented, resolution of models and data, and location modelled. We found that modelling methodology has been well developed to the point where multiple methods are available to represent detailed and contact-specific transmission and targeted control. However, detailed host and disease data needed to quantify these models are only available from a few outbreaks. To address existing challenges in data collection, novel data sources should be considered and integrated into models of FMDV transmission and control. We suggest modelling multiple endemic areas to advance local control and global control and better understand FMDV transmission dynamics. With incorporation of additional data, models can assist with both the design of targeted control and identification of transmission drivers across geographic boundaries.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to use meta-analytic methods to estimate the effect of a commercially available yeast culture product on milk production and other production measures in lactating dairy cows using a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Sixty-one research publications (published journal articles, published abstracts, and technical reports) were identified through a review of literature provided by the manufacturer and a search of published literature using 6 search engines. Thirty-six separate studies with 69 comparisons met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The fixed-effect meta-analysis showed substantial heterogeneity for milk yield, energy-corrected milk, 3.5\% fat-corrected milk, milk fat yield, and milk protein yield. Sub-group analysis of the data showed much less heterogeneity in peer-reviewed studies versus non-peer-reviewed abstracts and technical reports, and tended to show higher, but not significantly different, treatment effects. A random-effects meta-analysis showed estimated raw mean differences between treated and untreated cattle reported in peer-reviewed publications of 1.18 kg/d [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.55 to 1.81], 1.61 kg/d (95\% CI: 0.92 to 2.29), and 1.65 kg/d (95\% CI: 0.97 to 2.34) for milk yield, 3.5\% fat-corrected milk, and energy-corrected milk, respectively. Milk fat yield and milk protein yield for peer-reviewed studies showed an increase in the raw mean difference of 0.06 kg/d (95\% CI: 0.01 to 0.10) and 0.03 kg/d (95\% CI: 0.00 to 0.05), respectively. Estimated raw mean dry matter intake of the peer-reviewed studies during early lactation ({\textless}70 d in milk) and not-early lactation were 0.62 kg/d (95\% CI: 0.21 to 1.02) and a decrease of 0.78 kg/d (95\% CI: -1.36 to -0.21), respectively. These findings provide strong evidence that this commercially available yeast culture product provides significant improvement in several important milk production outcomes as evaluated in production settings typical for commercial dairies in North America. Utilizing meta-analytic methods to study the complete breadth of information relating to a specific treatment by studying multiple overcomes of all eligible studies can reduce the uncertainty often seen in small individual studies designed without sufficient power to detect differences in treatments.},

The study aimed to identify deficits in knowledge and areas of disparity between what is recommended in the field by veterinarians, foot trimmers and advisors and what has been substantiated experimentally. Peer reviewed literature containing original work was gathered by searching three databases. Papers were categorised and reviewed if they contained material on treatment or prevention. Non-peer reviewed clinical materials were collated from a range of sources. The materials were reviewed and categorised based on whether they recommended a range of possible treatment and prevention strategies. The peer reviewed data base contained 591 papers, of which 286 contained information on treatment or prevention. The vast majority of papers (258) concerned prevention; only a small number covered treatment (31) and of these only three contained information on the treatment of sole ulcers or white line disease. The number of intervention studies and trials was low; most papers on prevention were observational. Generally, lesion specific outcomes were not described making the findings of these papers difficult to use clinically. The non-peer reviewed material contained 46 sources; they varied significantly in regard to the treatments they advocated with some texts directly contradicting each other. Some aspects of prevention recommended in these sources seemed poorly supported by findings from the research literature. Well designed intervention studies are required to address these deficits.},

	abstract = {Human cadmium intake derives mainly from food sources, and cadmium can be present in high concentrations in some offal. A meta-analysis using random effects modeling was carried out to integrate the results of 21 controlled randomized trials in which sheep were fed diets with elevated cadmium levels and cadmium concentrations in their livers and kidneys were recorded after slaughter. Resulting predictions of cadmium accumulation in sheep are applicable to a broad set of exposure situations allowing the critical examination of cadmium in the human food chain. The product of the cadmium concentration in the feed and the duration of exposure to that feed were significant predictors of the cadmium concentration in livers and kidneys. The predominantly organic rather than inorganic form of cadmium in the feed further increased accumulation. Other variables (dry matter intake, the vehicle of the elevated cadmium in the diet, animal age, weight, and sex) were not significant. As a result, the prime measure to decrease the risk of cadmium from animal origin adversely affecting human health should be restricting the animals' cumulative cadmium intake. It is suggested that this might be achieved by preventing the livers and kidneys of older animals from entering the human food chain.},

Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, and checklist, relevant articles were identified and data were extracted and recorded. The review provided Leptospira seroprevalence data from 16 Caribbean islands (Barbados, Trinidad, Grenada, Puerto Rico, Saint Croix, St. Kitts and Nevis, Jamaica, Antigua, Carriacou, Dominica, Guadalupe, Martinique, Monserrat, St. Lucia, St. Maarten, and St. Vincent) in a variety of animal species. Reviewing the literature highlighted the limited amount of data available from limited number of islands. Many of the studies conducted have recorded seroprevalences based on variable and small samples sizes. Besides, serovar panels used for MAT were not consistent between studies. The review indicates that the Leptospira exposure in a given geographic location may change with time and climatic and environmental conditions, and highlights the need to conduct continual surveillance in tropical countries where the climate supports the survival of Leptospira in the environment. Specific attention must be given to standardization of MAT panels and protocols and providing training across laboratories involved in testing. Further, animal and environment testing to isolate and identify circulating Leptospira spp. in a geographic region must actively be pursued. This knowledge is important to implement geographically specific control programs, as risk factors of Leptospira transmission is favoured by various factors such as change in climatic conditions, urbanization, encroachment of wildlife inhabitation, import/export of animals, increase in adventure travel, and water related recreational activities.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of animal sentience is fundamental to many disciplines and imperative to the animal welfare movement. In this review, we examined what is being explored and discussed, regarding animal sentience, within the scientific literature. Rather than attempting to extract meaning from the many complex and abstract definitions of animal sentience, we searched over two decades of scientific literature using a peer-reviewed list of 174 keywords. The list consisted of human emotions, terminology associated with animal sentience, and traits often thought to be indicative of subjective states. We discovered that very little was actually being explored, and instead there was already much agreement about what animals can feel. Why then is there so much scepticism surrounding the science of animal sentience? Sentience refers to the subjective states of animals, and so is often thought to be impossible to measure objectively. However, when we consider that much of the research found to accept and utilise animal sentience is performed for the development of human drugs and treatment, it appears that measuring sentience is, after all, not quite as impossible as was previously thought. In this paper, we explored what has been published on animal sentience in the scientific literature and where the gaps in research lie. We drew conclusions on the implications for animal welfare science and argued for the importance of addressing these gaps in our knowledge. We found that there is a need for more research on positive emotional states in animals, and that there is still much to learn about taxa such as invertebrates. Such information will not only be useful in supporting and initiating legislative amendments but will help to increase understanding, and potentially positive actions and attitudes towards animals.},

Social relationships are fundamental to child and adolescent development; yet studies have been limited to children's relationships with other humans.

As the field is in the early stages; a broad set of inclusion criteria was applied. A systematic search of databases and grey literature sources found twenty-two studies meeting selection criteria. The review found evidence for an association between pet ownership and a wide range of emotional health benefits from childhood pet ownership; particularly for self-esteem and loneliness. The findings regarding childhood anxiety and depression were inconclusive. Studies also showed evidence of an association between pet ownership and educational and cognitive benefits; for example, in perspective-taking abilities and intellectual development. Evidence on behavioural development was unclear due to a lack of high quality research. Studies on pet ownership and social development provided evidence for an association with increased social competence; social networks; social interaction and social play behaviour. Overall, pet ownership and the significance of children's bonds with companion animals have been underexplored; there is a shortage of high quality and longitudinal studies in all outcomes. Prospective studies that control for a wide range of confounders are required.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a need for sensitive and specific rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for canine visceral leishmaniasis. The aims of this study were to evaluate the diagnostic performance of immunochromatographic dipstick RDTs using rK39 antigen for canine visceral leishmaniasis by (i) investigating the sensitivity of RDTs to detect infection, disease and infectiousness in a longitudinal cohort study of natural infection in Brazil, and (ii) using meta-analysis to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of RDTs from published studies. METHODOLOGY: We used a rK39 RDT (Kalazar Detect Canine Rapid Test; Inbios) to test sera collected from 54 sentinel dogs exposed to natural infection in an endemic area of Brazil. Dogs were sampled bimonthly for up to 27 months, and rK39 results compared to those of crude antigen ELISA, PCR, clinical status and infectiousness to sandflies. We then searched MEDLINE and Web of Knowledge (1993-2011) for original studies evaluating the performance of rK39 RDTs in dogs. Meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity was performed using bivariate mixed effects models. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The sensitivity of the rK39 RDT in Brazil to detect infection, disease and infectiousness was 46\%, 77\% and 78\% respectively. Sensitivity increased with time since infection, antibody titre, parasite load, clinical score and infectiousness. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. The combined sensitivity of rK39 RDTs was 86.7\% (95\% CI: 76.9-92.8\%) to detect clinical disease and 59.3\% (37.9-77.6\%) to detect infection. Combined specificity was 98.7\% (89.5-99.9\%). Both sensitivity and specificity varied considerably between studies. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic performance of rK39 RDTs is reasonable for confirmation of infection in suspected clinical cases, but the sensitivity to detect infected dogs is too low for large-scale epidemiological studies and operational control programmes.},

	abstract = {The objectives of this study were to critically review randomized controlled trials, and quantify, using meta-analysis and meta-regression, the effects of supplementation with fats on milk production and components by dairy cows. We reviewed 59 papers, of which 38 (containing 86 comparisons) met eligibility criteria. Five groups of fats were evaluated: tallows, calcium salts of palm fat (Megalac, Church and Dwight Co. Inc., Princeton, NJ), oilseeds, prilled fat, and other calcium salts. Milk production responses to fats were significant, and the estimated mean difference was 1.05 kg/cow per day, but results were heterogeneous. Milk yield increased with increased difference in dry matter intake (DMI) between treatment and control groups, decreased with predicted metabolizable energy (ME) balance between these groups, and decreased with increased difference in soluble protein percentage of the diet between groups. Decreases in DMI were significant for Megalac, oilseeds, and other Ca salts, and approached significance for tallow. Feeding fat for a longer period increased DMI, as did greater differences in the amount of soluble protein percentage of the diet between control and treatment diets. Tallow, oilseeds, and other Ca salts reduced, whereas Megalac increased, milk fat percentage. Milk fat percentage effects were heterogeneous for fat source. Differences between treatment and control groups in duodenal concentrations of C18:2 and C 18:0 fatty acids and Mg percentage reduced the milk fat percentage standardized mean difference. Milk fat yield responses to fat treatments were very variable. The other Ca salts substantially decrease, and the Megalac and oilseeds increased, fat yield. Fat yield increased with increased DMI difference between groups and was lower with an increased estimated ME balance between treatment and control groups, indicating increased partitioning of fat to body tissue reserves. Feeding fats decreased milk protein percentage, but results were heterogeneous. An increased number of milkings increased the milk protein percentage, whereas the difference between the treatment and control groups in duodenal concentrations of 18:2 fatty acids and dietary Mg concentration reduced the milk protein percentage. None of the fat treatments influenced milk protein production. The range of responses to different fats fed approached or exceeded 5 standard deviations from the mean and differed in point direction for all variables studied, indicating the varied and profound biological effects of fats. Responses to fat feeding were highly heterogeneous for all variables studied and heterogeneity was present within responses to individual fat groups. The lower DMI combined with higher milk and milk fat production showed that fats could improve the efficiency of milk production. More studies are required to more completely characterize sources of variation in responses to fats.},

The literature search identified 18 English-language publications on the use of Teatseal in dairy cattle. A total of 12 studies with 17 subtrials or comparisons including 13 positive control subtrials (internal teat sealant and ADCT vs. ADCT) and 4 negative control subtrials (internal teat sealant vs. untreated) examining IMI were included in the analysis. Internal teat sealants, alone or in the presence of ADCT, reduced the risk of acquiring new IMI after calving by 25\% [risk ratio (RR)=0.75; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.67 to 0.83]. Internal teat sealants reduced the risk of IMI by 73\% compared with untreated cows (RR=0.27; 95\% CI: 0.13 to 0.55). The results of both meta-analyses of IMI, with positive and negative controls, were heterogeneous [I(2) (a statistic that describes the proportion of total variation in study effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity)=65.4 and 92.1\%]. No farm or cow factors studied significantly contributed to the heterogeneity of the results. A total of 16 studies (21 subtrials), including 14 positive control subtrials and 7 negative control subtrials, examining clinical mastitis were included in the analysis. Internal teat sealants alone and in the presence of ADCT reduced the risk of clinical mastitis after calving in lactating cows by 29\% (RR=0.71; 95\% CI: 0.62 to 0.82), and 48\% (RR=0.52; 95\% CI: 0.37 to 0.75), respectively. The results of the meta-analysis on clinical mastitis with positive controls were homogeneous (I(2)=33.6\%), whereas the results of studies with negative controls were heterogeneous (I(2)=60.4\%). No farm or cow factors studied that had sufficient data to evaluate significantly contributed to the heterogeneity of the results. The estimated linear score (LS) of milk SCC after calving in published studies (n=3) and for studies that provided raw data (n=2), was significantly lower for cattle treated with internal teat sealants and ADCT in 3 studies than for cattle treated with internal teat sealants only. The estimated LS of pooled raw data of 3 studies from 32 herds showed that the LS of cows treated with internal teat sealant and ADCT was not significantly different than those treated with ADCT only. This study found that the application of internal teat sealants in the presence of ADCT or the use of internal teat sealants alone at dry off significantly reduced the incidence of IMI and clinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows compared with respective control groups. Further studies are needed to investigate the effect of internal teat sealants on postpartum milk SCC in lactating dairy cows.},

This meta-analysis examined 71 treatment and control comparisons extracted from 53 research papers. Programs evaluated included Ovsynch, natural breeding, single, double, or triple prostaglandin injections, Select Synch, Heat Synch, and modified Ovsynch. Pregnancy rates for Ovsynch programs did not differ significantly from those with natural breeding programs [predicted Bayesian relative risk (RR) = 1.04, 95\% Bayesian credible interval = 0.36 to 3.23]. Results of Ovsynch vs. PGF(2alpha) programs showed that the risk of conception (predicted Bayesian RR = 0.89, 95\% Bayesian credible interval = 0.31 to 2.64), and pregnancy rates predicted Bayesian RR = 1.11, 95\% Bayesian credible interval = 0.61 to 2.13) did not differ significantly between the Ovsynch group and cows in the PGF(2alpha) group. Comparisons between Ovsynch and Select Synch demonstrated that the risk of conception (predicted Bayesian RR = 0.94, 95\% Bayesian credible interval = 0.52 to 1.59), and pregnancy rates (predicted Bayesian RR = 1.08, 95\% Bayesian credible interval = 0.38 to 3.09) did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Examination of Ovsynch vs. modified Ovsynch programs showed that the risk of pregnancy in cows synchronized with modified Ovsynch was similar to those treated with Ovsynch (predicted Bayesian RR = 0.89, 95\% Bayesian credible interval = 0.71 to 1.12).Meta-analyses identified that the conception and pregnancy rates obtained with the prostaglandin, Select Synch, and modified Ovsynch (including presynch and CoSynch) programs were comparable with the Ovsynch program. Modifications to the Ovsynch program such as presynchronization and timed artificial insemination at the time of second GnRH injection (CoSynch) may be an alternative for reproductive management of dairy herds where detection of estrus is less than optimal. The findings of this study demonstrate that the Ovsynch program could benefit dairy operations because it allows for timed artificial insemination of lactating cows without detection of estrus. There was, however, little or no significant improvement in pregnancy rates using Ovsynch over other programs and the costs of labor and hormone administration should be considered when selecting this form of reproductive technology for routine use.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment programmes that included controlled internal drug-releasing (CIDR) devices containing progesterone (P4) in improving synchrony of oestrus, and conception and pregnancy rates in cycling, anoestrous and inseminated dairy cows, using meta-analysis. To describe the difference in response between cycling and anoestrous cows to CIDR-based synchrony programmes. METHODS: Scientific papers written in the English language between 1989 and 2002 that investigated the effects of treatment programmes including CIDR devices on reproductive performance in dairy heifers or lactating dairy cows were identified using a computerised literature search. The criteria for inclusion incorporated evidence that treatment allocation was completely randomised; the population studied was lactating dairy cows; and that data were available on submission, conception and pregnancy rates and their associated measures of variability. Reproductive outcomes from 25 synchrony trials (total n=11,058 cows) were analysed. Summary measures of the effect of treatment on reproductive outcome were assessed using fixed- and random-effects Bayesian meta-analysis models. RESULTS: Treatment programmes including a CIDR device increased the risk of submission in cycling cows (predicted Bayesian RR=2.86, 95\% credible interval=1.46-5.67). Compared with controls, synchrony programmes including CIDR devices in cycling dairy cows had no effect on the risk of conception to first service post-treatment (predicted Bayesian RR=1.00, 95\% credible interval=0.80-1.24). Compared with controls, synchrony programmes including CIDR devices had no effect on the risk of pregnancy throughout the mating period (predicted Bayesian RR=1.02, 95\% credible interval=0.89-1.17). In anoestrous cows, CIDR treatment had no effect on the risk of conception to first service post-treatment and no effect on the risk of pregnancy throughout the mating period, compared with anoestrous, untreated controls (predicted Bayesian RR=0.91 and 0.97, respectively; 95\% credible interval=0.68-1.26 and 0.59-1.60, respectively). CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis showed that synchrony programmes using CIDR devices combined with other hormones reliably enhanced submission rates in lactating dairy cows. The relatively small number of trials with data suitable for analysis and the heterogeneity of results at the individual trial level limited our ability to confirm either a beneficial or deleterious effect of treatment on conception or pregnancy rates. Further randomised, controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of this form of reproductive therapy in commercial dairy farms are needed.},

Criteria for inclusion in the study were information on the form of OTM, an adequate description of randomization, production and reproduction data, and associated measures of variance (SE or SD) and P-values. The OTM increased milk production by 0.93 kg [95\% confidence interval (CI)=0.61 to 1.25], milk fat by 0.04 kg (95\% CI=0.02 to 0.05), and milk protein by 0.03 kg (95\% CI=0.02 to 0.04) per day. Milk SCC was not different in cows supplemented with OTM. All production outcomes except milk solids (yield) and milk SCC were heterogeneous. Meta-regression analysis showed that feeding before calving, feeding for a full lactation after calving, and the use of other supplements increased responses over feeding after calving only, feeding for part of lactation, or not using other supplements, respectively. Supplementation of cows with OTM reduced days open (weighted mean difference=13.5 d) and number of services per conception (weighted mean difference=0.27) in lactating dairy cows. The risk of pregnancy on d 150 of lactation was greater in cows fed OTM (risk ratio=1.07), but OTM had no significant effect on the interval from calving to first service and 21-d pregnancy rate. There was no evidence of heterogeneity for any of the reproductive outcomes evaluated. The results of this meta-analysis showed that organic trace mineral supplementation could improve production and reproduction in lactating dairy cows.},

We found evidence that, for certain bioterrorism agents, pets, wildlife, or livestock could provide early warning and that for other agents, humans would likely manifest symptoms before illness could be detected in animals. After an acute attack, active surveillance of wild or domestic animal populations could help identify many ongoing exposure risks. If certain bioterrorism agents found their way into animal populations, they could spread widely through animal-to-animal transmission and prove difficult to control. The public health infrastructure must look beyond passive surveillance of acute animal disease events to build capacity for active surveillance and intervention efforts to detect and control ongoing outbreaks of disease in domestic and wild animal populations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The goal of this systematic review was to identify evidence that animals could serve as sentinels of an attack with a chemical terrorism agent. METHODS: The biomedical literature was systematically searched for evidence that wild or domestic animals exposed to certain chemical weapons of terrorism had either greater susceptibility, shorter latency period, or increased exposure risk versus humans. Additionally, we searched for documented reports of such animals historically serving as sentinels for chemical warfare agents. RESULTS: For a small number of agents, there was limited evidence that domestic and/or wild animals could provide sentinel information to humans following an airborne attack with chemical agents, usually related to increased potential for environmental exposure. Some of this evidence was based on anecdotal case reports, and in many cases high quality chemical terrorism agent evidence regarding comparative susceptibility, exposure, and latency between humans and sentinel animal species was not found. CONCLUSION: Currently, there is insufficient evidence for routine use of animals as sentinels for airborne chemical warfare agents. At the same time, Poison Center surveillance systems should include animal calls, and greater communication between veterinarians and physicians could help with preparedness for a chemical terrorism attack. Further analysis of comparative chemical warfare agent toxicity between sentinel animal species and humans is needed.},

A marked increase in published studies had occurred over the past decade, examining a wide range of hazards and outcomes. Most analytical studies were ecological or cross-sectional in nature. All cross-sectional studies sampled subjects on the basis of exposure, using a reference population for the selection of controls. Studies of wild animal populations may hold unique advantages for toxicant hazard identification, yet the current range of study designs appeared restricted. Increased use of study approaches such as sampling based on outcome, intra-population comparisons, as well as cohort and case-control designs may improve hazard identification and priority setting for confirmatory toxicological and human studies of effects seen in wildlife.},

	abstract = {Dietary proteins play an important role in reproduction, and increased dietary crude proteins, increased degradability of dietary proteins, and elevated blood or milk urea have been associated with decreased conception and pregnancy in many studies. The aim of this work was to provide a meta-analysis on the relationship between high milk or blood urea and pregnancy or conception, with a focus on defining the appropriate urea threshold associated with this issue. The meta-analysis included 61 different models from 21 papers. The thresholds of urea tested in the various models were built by steps of 1 mM urea. This constructed variable reduced heterogeneity by 61\% in the meta-regression. The meta-analysis showed 43\% lower odds of pregnancy or conception (odds ratio = 0.57; 95\% confidence interval = 0.45-0.73) in cases where urea was {\textgreater}/=7.0 mM in the blood (plasma urea nitrogen = 19.3 mg/dL) or where urea was {\textgreater}/=420 mg/L in the milk compared with where urea values were lower. This threshold is the most suitable with regard to pregnancy or conception success, even if a threshold of 6.5 mM cannot be excluded with certainty. The results also highlighted the possibility of a stronger association between high urea concentrations and pregnancy or conception when high nitrogen exposure occurs before artificial insemination compared with after artificial insemination, but this possibility needs to be further studied. Whether the present results also apply to extensively pasture-based countries remains to be determined.},

	abstract = {Many studies have shown that subclinical ketosis (SCK) is associated with an increased risk of developing various diseases, reproductive disorders, and changes in milk production. The present work aims at producing an overview between this disorder and theses outcomes. A meta-analysis of the literature, including 131 different models from 23 papers, or a review when the literature was scarce was conducted. For each outcome, the odds ratio (OR), relative risk, or hazard ratio was presented for various moderators to reduce heterogeneity among the studies. The raw change in milk production associated with SCK was estimated and adjusted, taking into consideration the outcomes known to interact with milk production during the peripartum period. The results showed that 2 main categories of moderators had a significant effect on the adjusted risk. First, the adjustment made by defining SCK as (1) beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration {\textgreater}1.4 mM, (2) nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration {\textgreater}0.4 mM prepartum, or (3) NEFA concentration {\textgreater}1.0 mM postpartum corrected the underestimated risk (despite low significance). This is because several trials reported the relevant risks using lower thresholds for the beta-hydroxybutyrate or NEFA values. Using a low threshold leads to lower risk of disease compared with using a high threshold. Second, the correction produced using the polyfactorial terms corrected the overestimation of risk because many trials reported only univariable models. The relative risk or OR (95\% confidence interval) related to abomasal displacement, clinical ketosis, early culling and death, metritis, placental retention, clinical mastitis, lameness, and a doubling of the SCC in cases with SCK were 3.33 (2.60-4.25), 5.38 (3.27-8.83), 1.92 (1.60-2.30), 1.75 (1.54-2.01), 1.52 (1.20-1.93), 1.61 (1.24-2.09), 2.01(1.64-2.44), and 1.42 (1.26-1.60), respectively. The precision level of the estimate depended on the outcome. The direct mean +/- standard deviation of the 305-d milk losses associated with SCK were 251 +/- 73 kg after adjusting for abomasal displacement, clinical ketosis, metritis, and placental retention. The OR (95\% confidence interval) for first service calving risk in cases of SCK was 0.67 (0.53-0.83). The calving-to-first-service interval was 8 d longer and the calving-to-conception interval was 16 to 22 d longer in cows with SCK. The relationships among the different reproductive indicators were quantified in only 1 or 2 trials. The present work highlights the need to conduct further studies on the associations between SCK and the risks of diseases, changes in milk production, and reproductive parameters.},

We investigated the impact of specific periparturient management practices on within-herd JD prevalence and economic losses foregone in UK dairy herds by means of data synthesis (systematic appraisal of published evidence and expert elicitation) and use of a pre-existing simulation model. Our results show the scarcity of accurate estimates of the impact of specific periparturient management practices on within-herd JD prevalence, which could, in part, be explained by challenges associated with the chronic nature of JD. Management practices aiming to limit the faecal-oral transmission route of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) were found to be most effective at reducing within-herd prevalence of JD. Practices aiming to limit MAP transmission via colostrum and milk were found to be less effective. Losses foregone for a hypothetical herd of 200 milking cows were considerable; based on the assumptions, it is reasonable to expect between pound7000 and pound11,000 of losses foregone when management practices are implemented as a package of measures. The findings of this study are envisaged to enable farmers and veterinarians to make more informed decisions on changes to periparturient management to control JD.},

This protozoan causes a significant public health problem in humans and imposes considerable economic losses and damages to husbandry industries. The final host, cats, accounts for all of these significant burdens. Hence the present study was designed to analyse and review the overall prevalence rate of T. gondii infection in cats in Iran for the first time. In the present study data collection (published and unpublished papers, abstracts of proceedings of national parasitology congresses and dissertations) was systematically undertaken on electronic databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, Ebsco, Science Direct, Scopus, Magiran, Irandoc, IranMedex and Scientific Information Database. A total of 21 studies from 1975 to 2013 reporting prevalence of Toxoplasma infection in cats from different areas in Iran met the eligibility criteria. The pooled proportion of toxoplasmosis using the random-effect model amongst cats was estimated at 33.6\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 22.05-46.41). The prevalence rate of cat toxoplasmosis in various regions of Iran ranged from 1.2\% to 89.2\%. Firstly, this study establishes a crude prevalence rate of T. gondii infection in cats. Secondly, it discusses the role of significant risk factors including sex, age and being either household or stray cats, in the epidemiology of the disease. Furthermore, the current study determines gaps and drawbacks in the prior studies that are useful to keep in mind to assist in designing more accurate investigations in future.},

A systematic review of the economic impact of N. caninum infections/abortions was conducted, searching PubMed with the terms 'cattle' and 'Neospora'. This yielded 769 publications and the abstracts were screened for economically relevant information (e.g. abortion prevalence and risk, serological prevalence). Further analysis was restricted to countries with at least five relevant publications. In total, 99 studies (12.9\%) from 10 countries contained data from the beef industry (25 papers (25.3\%)) and 72 papers (72.8\%) from the dairy industry (with the remaining two papers (2.0\%) describing general abortion statistics). The total annual cost of N. caninum infections/abortions was estimated to range from a median US \$1.1 million in the New Zealand beef industry to an estimated median total of US \$546.3 million impact per annum in the US dairy population. The estimate for the total median N. caninum-related losses exceeded US \$1.298 billion per annum, ranging as high as US \$2.380 billion. Nearly two-thirds of the losses were incurred by the dairy industry (US \$842.9 million). Annual losses on individual dairy farms were estimated to reach a median of US \$1,600.00, while on beef farms these costs amounted to just US \$150.00. Pregnant cows and heifers were estimated to incur, on average, a loss due to N. caninum of less than US \$20.00 for dairy and less than US \$5.00 for beef. These loss estimates, however, rose to approximately US \$110.00 and US \$40.00, respectively, for N. caninum-infected pregnant dairy and beef cows. This estimate of global losses due to N. caninum, with the identification of clear target markets (countries, as well as cattle industries), should provide an incentive to develop treatment options and/or vaccines.},

	abstract = {High ambient temperature (T) is one of the most important climatic factors influencing pig performance. Increased T occurs sporadically during summer heat waves in temperate climates and year round in tropical climates. Results of published experiments assessing the effects of high T on pig performance are surprisingly variable. Thus, a meta-analysis was performed to aggregate our knowledge and attempt to explain differences in the results across studies on the effect of increased T on ADFI and ADG in growing-finishing pigs. Data for ADFI and ADG were extracted from 86 and 80 trials, respectively, from articles published in scientific journals indexed in PubMed, Science Direct, and from proceedings of scientific meetings through November 2009. Data on ADFI and ADG were analyzed using a linear mixed model that included the linear and the quadratic effects of T and BW, and their interactions as continuous, fixed effects variables, and the trial as a random effect factor (i.e., block). In addition, the effects of housing type (2 levels: individual and group housing) and the year of publication (3 levels: 1970 to 1989, 1990 to 1999, and 2000 to 2009) on the intercept and the linear regression term for T (i.e., the slope) were also tested. Results showed that high T had a curvilinear effect on ADFI and ADG and that this effect was more pronounced in heavier pigs. Across T, ADFI was less when pigs were group-housed. The intercept and the regression coefficient (slope) for T were significantly affected by the year of publication. The effect of increased T was greater in more contemporary works, suggesting that modern genotypes could be more sensitive to heat stress than older genotypes of lesser growth potential. In conclusion, pig performance decreases at an accelerating rate as T is increased. The large between-study variability on the effects of high T on pig performance is partially explained by differences in pig BW and to a lesser extent by the year the study was published.},

Only papers that involved in ovo carbohydrate injections in poultry were used in this study. After specific selection criteria, 17 papers were selected. The quality scoring system of the selected studies was based on the injection methodology, use of control groups, type of solution injected, period of injection, egg and hens characteristics, number of variables analysed and the statistical design. Among papers, there was no standardised procedure in to inoculate the solutions. Nevertheless, in general, in ovo feeding of carbohydrates decreases the hatch rate, improves the hatch weight, but it does not seem to influence the post-hatch performance of broilers. The inoculation of 75 mg of glucose in the albumen seems to bring better results. Further studies are needed to improve the technical methodology of in ovo injections for commercial use.},

The current literature contains several studies detailing analyses with conflicting results as to whether intramammary infection (IMI) with the minor pathogens decreases, increases, or has no effect on the risk of a quarter acquiring a new intramammary infection (NIMI) with a major pathogen. To investigate the available scientific evidence regarding the effect of IMI with minor pathogens on the acquisition of NIMI with major pathogens, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. The total extant English- and French-language literature in electronic databases was searched and all publications cited by relevant papers were investigated. Results from 68 studies were extracted from 38 relevant papers. Random-effects models were used to investigate the effects of CNS and C. bovis on acquisition of new IMI with any of the major pathogens, as well as individually for the minor pathogens and Staph. aureus. Significant heterogeneity among studies exists, some of which could be accounted for by using meta-regression. Overall, observational studies showed no effect, whereas challenge studies showed strong and significant protective effects, specifically when major pathogens were introduced into the mammary gland via methods bypassing the teat end. Underlying risk can account for several unmeasured factors, and studies with higher underlying risk found more protective effects of minor pathogens. Larger doses of challenge organisms reduced the protective effect of minor pathogens, and studies with more stringent diagnostic criteria for pathogen IMI identified less protection. Smaller studies (those utilizing fewer than 40 cows) also showed a greater protective effect than larger studies.},

In this systematic review of the impact of BVDV, studies were analysed with a particular focus on the monetary implications and types of direct losses, the initial infection status of herds, production systems, time periods of assessment, calculation level, study types and whether or not country-specific assessments were published. A linear mixed model was applied to analyse factors that influence the level of monetary direct losses due to BVDV infection. The 44 studies included in this review covered 15 countries and assessed direct monetary losses due to BVDV incurred over the past 30 years. Direct losses between and within countries were largely heterogeneous with respect to the monetary level and types of direct losses, ranging from 0.50 to 687.80 US dollars (USD) per animal.1 Average direct losses per naive dairy cow were USD24.85 higher than per beef cow. Country-specific assessments of direct losses due to BVDV were provided in 38/44 (86.4\%) studies. Mortality, morbidity, premature culling, stillbirths, abortion, reinfection, country and study type had a significant influence on the monetary level of direct losses (r2 = 0.69). Countries recording direct losses were more likely to carry out voluntary or compulsory control and eradication programmes (odds ratio = 10.2; 95\% confidence interval 1.7-81.9; P = 0.004).},

	abstract = {The study was aimed at summarising the literature that compares the incidence levels of spontaneously occurring intramammary infections (IMI) during the dry period, without versus with antibiotic dry cow treatment (DCT). A meta-analytic relative risk (RR) calculation was implemented when a priori relevant. Two main categories of comparison were used in the 36 selected papers. In the first category, the udder quarters were randomly allocated (at quarter or cow level) to an untreated or a treated group. Quarter incidence averaged 12.8\% (weighted mean) in untreated quarters, and depending on the DCT used, from 6.6 to 8.0\% in treated quarters. The meta-analytic RR of new IMI for untreated versus treated quarters varied from 1.54 to 1.94, depending on the DCT used. DCT was mainly found effective against IMI due to streptococci and coagulase-positive staphylococci. Based on only a few papers, the application of an internal teat sealer was associated to a quite similar (or possibly better) protection against IMI than DCT, but only in a subpopulation of particular (selected) cows. In the second category of studies, a selective dry cow or quarter antibiotic-treatment (selective DCT or DQT), according to cow or quarter selection criteria, was compared to blanket DCT. The meta-analytic RR of new IMI was 1.71 for selective DCT versus blanket DCT. Selective DQT seemed to be more at risk than selective DCT, but consisted of treating a much lower proportion of quarters. The summary-results provided by our meta-analysis should only be used with caution, due to possibly low external validity. More research seems to be relevant on the risk factors of new IMI during the dry period to make the outcomes of omission of DCT in selected cows more predictable under field conditions.},

	abstract = {The sex of a bird can, in principle, affect exposure and accumulation of mercury. One conventional explanation for sex differences in mercury burden suggests female birds should have lower concentrations than conspecific males, because breeding females can depurate methylmercury to their eggs. However, sex differences in body burden of mercury among birds are not consistent. We used meta-analysis to synthesize 123 male-female comparisons of mercury burden from 50 studies. For breeding birds, males had higher concentrations of mercury than did females, supporting egg depuration as a mechanism. However, the percentage of female body mass represented by a clutch did not significantly predict the magnitude of the sex difference in mercury contamination, as predicted. Furthermore, whether species were semialtrical or altrical versus semiprecocial or precocial also did not explain sex differences in mercury burden. Foraging guild of a species did explain near significant variation in sex differences in mercury burden where piscivores and invertivores showed significant sex differences, but sex differences were not detected for carnivores, herbivores, insectivores, and omnivores. The magnitude and direction of sexual size dimorphism did not explain variation in sex differences in mercury burden among breeding birds. We reveal targeted research directions on mechanisms for sex differences in mercury and confirm that sex is important to consider for environmental risk assessments based on breeding birds.},

	abstract = {Evidence is increasing of positive effects of feeding fats during transition on fertility and the adaptation to lactation. This study used meta-analytic methods to explore the effects of including fats in the transition diet on the risk of pregnancy to service (proportion pregnant) and calving to pregnancy interval. Meta-analysis was used to integrate smaller studies and increase the statistical power over that of any single study and explore new hypotheses. We explored the effect of fats and diet composition on fertility using meta-regression methods. Relatively few highly controlled studies are available providing detailed descriptions of the diets used that examined interactions between fat nutrition and reproductive outcomes. Only 17 studies containing 26 comparisons were suitable for inclusion in statistical evaluations. Reproductive variables evaluated were risk of pregnancy (proportion pregnant), primarily to first service, and calving to pregnancy interval. Production variables examined were milk yield, milk composition, and body weight. The sources of heterogeneity in these studies were also explored. A 27\% overall increase in pregnancy to service was observed (relative risk=1.27; 95\% confidence interval Knapp Hartung 1.09 to 1.45), and results were relatively consistent (I(2)=19.9\%). A strong indication of a reduction in calving to pregnancy interval was also identified, which was consistent across studies (I(2)=0.0\%), supporting a conclusion that, overall, the inclusion of fats does improve fertility. Further exploration of the factors contributing to proportion pregnant using bivariate meta-regression identified variables that reflected changes in diet composition or animal response resulting from inclusion of the fat interventions in the experimental diets fed. Increased fermentable neutral detergent fiber and soluble fiber intakes increased the proportion pregnant, whereas increased milk yield of the treatment group decreased this measure. Unexpectedly, the estimated energy costs of urea production also had a positive association with proportion pregnant. The limited number of suitable studies for the analysis highlights the need for more work to improve understanding of the critical nutritional factors affecting fertility. These factors include specific fatty acids in dietary interventions that contribute to increasing fertility of cows in dairy production systems.},

This systematic review analyses conventional and novel early detection methods applied to surveillance. In all, 125 scientific documents were considered for this study. Exotic (n = 49) and re-emerging (n = 27) diseases constituted the most frequently represented health threats. In addition, the majority of studies were related to zoonoses (n = 66). The approaches found in the review could be divided in surveillance modalities, both active (n = 23) and passive (n = 5); and tools and methodologies that support surveillance activities (n = 57). Combinations of surveillance modalities and tools (n = 40) were also found. Risk-based approaches were very common (n = 60), especially in the papers describing tools and methodologies (n = 50). The main applications, benefits and limitations of each approach were extracted from the papers. This information will be very useful for informing the development of tools to facilitate the design of cost-effective surveillance strategies. Thus, the current literature review provides key information about the advantages, disadvantages, limitations and potential application of methodologies for the early detection of new, exotic and re-emerging diseases.},

Is there a scope for more effective VL control in the Americas where transmission is zoonotic? We reviewed the evidence on VL control strategies in Latin America-diagnosis, treatment, veterinary interventions, vector control-with respect to entomological and clinical outcomes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We searched the electronic databases of MEDLINE, LILACS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from 1960 to November 2008 and references of selected articles. Intervention trials as well as observational studies that evaluated control strategies of VL in the Americas were included. While the use of rapid diagnostic tests for VL diagnosis seems well established, there is a striking lack of evidence from clinical trials for drug therapy and few well designed intervention studies for control of vectors or canine reservoirs. CONCLUSION: Elimination of zoonotic VL in the Americas does not seem a realistic goal at this point given the lack of political commitment, gaps in scientific knowledge, and the weakness of case management and surveillance systems. Research priorities and current strategies should be reviewed with the aim of achieving better VL control.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical audit is a quality improvement process with the goal of continuously improving quality of patient care as assessed by explicit criteria. In human medicine clinical audit has become an integral and required component of the standard of care. In contrast, in veterinary medicine there appear to have been a limited number of clinical audits published, indicating that while clinical audit is recognised, its adoption in veterinary medicine is still in its infancy. A systematic review was designed to report and evaluate the veterinary literature on clinical audit in companion animal species (dog, cat, horse). A systematic search of English and French articles using Proquest Dissertations and Theses database (February 6, 2014), CAB Abstracts (March 21, 2014 and April 4, 2014), Scopus (March 21, 2014), Web of Science Citation index (March 21, 2014) and OVID Medline (March 21, 2014) was performed. Included articles were those either discussing clinical audit (such as review articles and editorials) or reporting parts of, or complete, audit cycles. RESULTS: The majority of articles describing clinical audit were reviews. From 89 articles identified, twenty-one articles were included and available for review. Twelve articles were reviews of clinical audit in veterinary medicine, five articles included at least one veterinary clinical audit, one thesis was identified, one report was of a veterinary clinical audit website and two articles reported incomplete clinical audits. There was no indication of an increase in the number of published clinical audits since the first report in 1998. However, there was evidence of article misclassification, with studies fulfilling the criteria of clinical audit not appropriately recognised. Quality of study design and reporting of findings varied considerably, with information missing on key components, including duration of study, changes in practice implemented between audits, development of explicit criteria and appropriate statistical analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence suggests the application and reporting of clinical audit in veterinary medicine is sporadic despite the potential to improve patient care, though the true incidence of clinical audit reporting is likely to be underestimated due to incorrect indexing. Reporting standards of clinical audits are highly variable, limiting evaluation, application and repeatability of published work.},

	abstract = {Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus (RVFV) is an emerging vector-borne pathogen that causes sporadic epizootics and epidemics with multi-year, apparently quiescent, inter-epidemic periods. The epidemiology and ecology of the virus during these inter-epidemic periods is poorly understood. There is evidence for low-level circulation of the virus in livestock and wild ruminants; however, as of yet there is no evidence to identify a specific mammalian reservoir host. Using a systematic approach, this review synthesizes results from serosurveys, attempts at viral detection, and experimental infection of wildlife. These data demonstrate there is a gap in research conducted on RVF in wild ruminants. Specifically, there is very little published data on the pathogenicity of an RVFV infection in various wildlife species, validation of diagnostic assays for exposure to RVFV and understanding of epizootic or endemic disease dynamics in wild ruminants. We recommend that future research on RVFV incorporate a more systematic approach to understand the low-level cycling of the virus during inter-epidemic periods in both wild and domestic ruminant species.},

DESIGN: Standardized, systematic evaluation of the literature, categorization of relevant articles according to level of evidence and quality, and development of consensus on conclusions for application of the concepts to clinical practice. SETTING: Academia, referral practice, and general practice RESULTS: Sixteen population, intervention, control group, outcome questions were evaluated to determine if recommendations could be made concerning drug therapy, including vasopressors, vagolytics, corticosteroids, reversal agents, buffer therapy, and correction of electrolyte disturbances. Electrical defibrillation strategies as well as other advanced interventions such as open-chest CPR, impedance threshold devices, and special considerations regarding anesthesia-related cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) were also investigated. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence supporting the use of standard-dose (0.01 mg/kg) epinephrine in CPR, as well as early electrical defibrillation for animals experiencing CPA due to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, preferentially using a biphasic defibrillator. For CPA due to certain causes and with the availability of advanced postcardiac arrest support, open chest CPR is preferred. Many knowledge gaps regarding other pharmacologic and advanced therapies were identified, and further studies are recommended to better systematically address these questions.},

	abstract = {Since the 1980s, efforts have been made to develop sensors that measure a parameter from an individual cow. The development started with individual cow recognition and was followed by sensors that measure the electrical conductivity of milk and pedometers that measure activity. The aim of this review is to provide a structured overview of the published sensor systems for dairy health management. The development of sensor systems can be described by the following 4 levels: (I) techniques that measure something about the cow (e.g., activity); (II) interpretations that summarize changes in the sensor data (e.g., increase in activity) to produce information about the cow's status (e.g., estrus); (III) integration of information where sensor information is supplemented with other information (e.g., economic information) to produce advice (e.g., whether to inseminate a cow or not); and (IV) the farmer makes a decision or the sensor system makes the decision autonomously (e.g., the inseminator is called). This review has structured a total of 126 publications describing 139 sensor systems and compared them based on the 4 levels. The publications were published in the Thomson Reuters (formerly ISI) Web of Science database from January 2002 until June 2012 or in the proceedings of 3 conferences on precision (dairy) farming in 2009, 2010, and 2011. Most studies concerned the detection of mastitis (25\%), fertility (33\%), and locomotion problems (30\%), with fewer studies (16\%) related to the detection of metabolic problems. Many studies presented sensor systems at levels I and II, but none did so at levels III and IV. Most of the work for mastitis (92\%) and fertility (75\%) is done at level II. For locomotion (53\%) and metabolism (69\%), more than half of the work is done at level I. The performance of sensor systems varies based on the choice of gold standards, algorithms, and test sizes (number of farms and cows). Studies on sensor systems for mastitis and estrus have shown that sensor systems are brought to a higher level; however, the need to improve detection performance still exists. Studies on sensor systems for locomotion problems have shown that the search continues for the most appropriate indicators, sensor techniques, and gold standards. Studies on metabolic problems show that it is still unclear which indicator reflects best the metabolic problems that should be detected. No systems with integrated decision support models have been found.},

Those selected approached the finishing of confined cows and specified animal genetic group, breed, and age at experiment start. Moreover, all these studies evaluated sensory and organoleptic characteristics of meat, following the same method. Each variable was analyzed by logistic regression, using the LOGISTIC procedure of SAS. The factors were evaluated by odds ratio (OR), in which changes in the probability of meat tenderness were estimated by means of an add-on function in regression variable units. Animal age at the beginning of termination, percentages of zebuine blood and heterozygosity, and marbling score are factors that affect (p {\textless} 0.30) the chance of beef tenderness. The probabilities of obtaining a tender meat increase when age at termination beginning and zebuine genotype participation are reduced, as well as when heterozygosity (via crosses) and meat marbling score increases.},

The aim of the current systematic review study is to clarify the latest status of studies in the literature regarding SAG1-associated recombinant proteins or SAG1-associated recombinant DNAs as potential vaccines against toxoplasmosis. Data were systematically collected from six databases including PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Google Scholar, EBSCO and Scopus, up to 1st of January 2019. A total of 87 articles were eligible for inclusion criteria in the current systematic review. The most common antigens used for experimental cocktail vaccines together with SAG1 were ROP2 and SAG2. In addition, the most parasite strains used were RH and ME49. Freund's adjuvant and cholera toxin have been predominantly utilized. Furthermore, regarding the animal models, route and dose of vaccination, challenge methods, measurement of immune responses and cyst burden have been discussed in the text. Most of these experimental vaccines induce immune responses and have a high degree of protection against parasite infections, increase survival rates and duration and reduce cyst burdens. The data demonstrated that SAG1 antigen has a high potential for use as a vaccine and provided a promising approach for protecting humans and animals against toxoplasmosis.},

Thoracic contusion is the most common injury and mechanical and thermal nociception are the most frequently assessed NP components. The benefits of physical exercise vary according to its starting period and total duration. In addition, there is considerable heterogeneity regarding the type and intensity of exercise capable of alleviating NP after SCI. Furthermore, physical exercise has beneficial effects on mechanical, thermal and cold nociception, and spontaneous pain.

In this context, arginine is a precursor in the synthesis of numerous molecules, such as nitric oxide and polyamines, which play an important role during reproduction. However, contradictory studies are found in the literature, particularly regarding the amount of supplementation and the period of pregnancy in which it is used. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary arginine supplementation for pregnant sows on foetal development via a systematic review. The search for papers was performed during the month of December 2015, in the databases ISI Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, and SciELO. From a total of 5675 returned studies, only 13 papers were selected after applying selection criteria. Most (47\%) of the studies that evaluated the effects of dietary arginine supplementation on foetal development in pigs used 1\% arginine. Supplementation was initiated in the first third of pregnancy in 47\% of tests, including in both primiparous and multiparous sows. These studies showed positive results for embryo survival and foetal development, evidenced by the increase in placental weight and the number and weight of piglets born alive. Of all evaluated studies, 53\% showed benefits on foetal development. It is concluded that supplementing dietary arginine in gestating sows can benefit embryo survival and foetal development. However, to establish a supplementation plan with this amino acid, aspects related to the period of pregnancy, supplementation levels, and source of arginine must be well defined.},

	abstract = {The use of functional nutrients has been proposed to reduce the occurrence of intrauterine growth retardation in animals at birth in several mammalian species. The objective of this study was to verify the effectiveness of citrulline and N-carbamylglutamate (NCG) dietary supplementation as arginine precursors for mammalian species, and the effects on fetal development through a systematic review. The search for studies was performed during August 2018 in the PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Science Direct, and Scopus databases. The literature search was conducted using "arginine precursor", "citrulline", or "N-carbamylglutamate" as keywords, combined with "gestation", "pregnancy", "fetus", "newborn", or "reproduction". Studies in which arginine precursors were evaluated in gestating mammals and their effects on parameters related to the intrauterine development of the conceptus were selected. Of 1,379 articles, 18 were selected, primarily based on the title and the abstract. Supplementation with NCG (0.5 g to 2 g/kg of feed) increased maternal plasma arginine concentrations in all studies that evaluated this variable. Fetal number increased in 55.56\% of the studies that evaluated it, and fetal weight increased in the majority (62.5\%) of the studies evaluating this variable. By supplementing citrulline, only fetal weight was improved, with an increase in maternal plasma arginine in 40\% of the studies. In conclusion, N-carbamoyl glutamate seems to be an arginine precursor more effective than L-citrulline during gestation; however, both precursors, beside L-Arginine, should be evaluated in similar conditions to confirm the existence of specific particularities such as periods and levels of supplementation, which need to be considered for different species of animals. The supplementation of NCG increases arginine concentrations in maternal plasma, thus improving mammalian reproductive efficiency and fetal development, mainly by promoting higher birth weight.},

	abstract = {Host immune responses are pivotal for the successful treatment of the leishmaniases, a spectrum of infections caused by Leishmania parasites. Previous studies speculated that augmenting cytokines associated with a type 1 T-helper cell (Th1) response is necessary to combat severe forms of leishmaniasis, and it has been hypothesized that the antileishmanial drug miltefosine is capable of immunomodulation and induction of Th1 cytokines. A better understanding of the immunomodulatory effects of miltefosine is central to providing a rationale regarding synergistic mechanisms of activity to combine miltefosine optimally with other conventional and future antileishmanials that are currently under development. Therefore, a systematic literature search was performed to evaluate to what extent and how miltefosine influences the host Th1 response. Miltefosine's effects observed in both a preclinical and a clinical context associated with immunomodulation in the treatment of leishmaniasis are evaluated in this review. A total of 27 studies were included in the analysis. Based on the current evidence, miltefosine is not only capable of inducing direct parasite killing but also of modulating the host immunity. Our findings suggest that miltefosine-induced activation of Th1 cytokines, particularly represented by increased gamma interferon (IFN-P) and interleukin 12 (IL-12), is essential to prevail over the Leishmania-driven Th2 response. Differences in miltefosine-induced host-mediated effects between in vitro, ex vivo, animal model, and human studies are further discussed. All things considered, an effective treatment with miltefosine is acquired by enhanced functional Th1 cytokine responses and may further be enhanced in combination with immunostimulatory agents.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The soil-transmitted helminths (STH), Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworms, infect 1.5 billion people worldwide and cause an estimated burden of 3.3 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Current control strategies focus on morbidity reduction through preventive chemotherapy (PC) but the most commonly used recommended drugs (albendazole and mebendazole) are particularly inefficacious against T. trichiura. This, together with the threat of emerging drug resistance, calls for new control strategies, including co-administration with other anthelminthics. Ivermectin plus albendazole is widely used against lymphatic filariasis, but its efficacy and safety against STH infections has not yet been fully understood. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of ivermectin-albendazole co-administration in five different databases (i.e. PubMed, ISI Web of Science, ScienceDirect, CENTRAL and clinicaltrials.gov) from 1960 to January 2018. Four studies reporting efficacy of ivermectin-albendazole against STH infections and five studies on its safety met the selection criteria and were included for quantitative analysis. Ivermectin-albendazole was significantly associated with lower risk (risk ratio (RR) = 0.44, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.31-0.62) for T. trichiura infection after treatment compared to albendazole alone. The co-administration revealed no or only a marginal benefit on cure and egg reduction rates over albendazole alone for A. lumbricoides and hookworm infections. Adverse events (AEs) occurring after ivermectin-albendazole co-administration were mostly mild and transient. Overall, the number of individuals reporting any AE was not different (RR = 1.09, 95\% CI = 0.87-1.36) in co-treated and albendazole-treated patients. However, although not statistically significant, sub-group analysis showed a tendency for slightly more AEs in patients with filariasis treated with ivermectin-albendazole compared to those treated with albendazole alone (RR = 1.29, 95\% CI = 0.81-2.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a good tolerability and higher efficacy of ivermectin-albendazole against T. trichiura compared to the current standard single-dose albendazole treatment, which supports the use of this co-administration in PC programs. Large-scale definitive randomized controlled trials are required to confirm our results.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Patients with myocardial infarction and hypoxemia require supplemental oxygen. However, the current therapeutic paradigm is contradicted by several recent studies in which the post-infarcted heart appears to benefit from systemic hypoxia. With this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to discover whether systemic hypoxia is beneficial or detrimental to the infarcted myocardium. METHODS: We conducted an electronic search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases and extracted the outcomes of cardiac function, geometry, and hemodynamics. A random-effect model was applied when the I2 value of greater than 50\%. The sensitivity analysis was performed by omitting one study at a time, and publication bias was assessed using Egger's test. In addition, the quality of studies was evaluated using the risk of bias tool devised by the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation. RESULTS: Six reports comprising 14 experiments were ultimately screened from among 10,323 initially identified preclinical studies. Few studies reported the method of randomization and none described allocation concealment, random outcome assessment or blinding. Overall, chronic hypoxia was found to have a beneficial effect on the ejection fraction (standard mean difference [SMD] = 5.39; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 3.83 to 6.95; P {\textless} 0.001) of the infarcted heart, whereas acute hypoxia significantly improved hemodynamics, as indicated by an increase in the maximal rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (SMD = 1.27; 95\% CI, 0.27 to 2.28; P = 0.013) and cardiac output (SMD = 1.26; 95\% CI, 0.34 to 2.18; P = 0.007) and a decrease in total systematic vascular resistance (SMD = -0.89; 95\% CI, -1.24 to -0.53; P {\textless} 0.001). Furthermore, a reduced oxygen content increased the stroke volume (P = 0.010). However, hypoxia reduced the end-systolic (SMD = -2.67; 95\% CI, -4.09 to -1.26; P {\textless} 0.001) and end-diastolic (SMD = -3.61; 95\% CI, -4.65 to -2.57; P {\textless} 0.001) left ventricular diameters and increased the total pulmonary resistance (SMD = 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.20 to 1.33; P = 0.008), pulmonary arterial mean pressure (SMD = 2.02; 95\% CI, 0.23 to 3.81; P = 0.027), and left atrial pressure (SMD = 1.20; 95\% CI, 0.57 to 1.82; P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: Hypoxia significantly improved heart function after infarction, with particular beneficial effects on systolic function and hemodynamics. However, it had slightly adverse effects on pulmonary circulation and left ventricular geometry. A lower inspired oxygen concentration may improve cardiac function, although further research is needed to determine the optimum level of hypoxia. Finally, more studies of hypoxia and myocardial infarction in larger species are required before these findings can be incorporated into therapeutic guidelines.},

	abstract = {A systematic review was conducted to elucidate the role of teat-end hyperkeratosis (THK) as a risk factor for clinical mastitis (CM) or subclinical mastitis (SCM). Scientific papers on the subject were identified by means of a database search. All types of peer-reviewed analytical studies, observational or experimental and published in English, could be included in the review, regardless of publication year. Of 152 identified records, 18 articles were selected, of which 8 were prospective cohort studies, 9 were cross-sectional, and 1 was a hybrid case-control study. Internal validity of studies was assessed using a score system ranging from 0 to 6, based on design, risk of bias, and statistical methods. The most frequent study limitation was improper use of statistical methods to avoid confounding of associations between THK and CM or SCM. The 3 studies that used CM as outcome (all with high validity scores) showed positive associations with THK (especially severe), although the magnitude and statistical significance of the estimates differed among them. Most studies that used SCM as the primary outcome (based on microbiological examination of milk) reported that only severe THK was associated with SCM. Two studies with high validity scores reported moderate to strong associations between severe THK and incidence or prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus intramammary infection. Two studies with high validity scores reported that only severe THK was associated with the risk of somatic cell count (SCC) ≥200,000 cells/mL and increased mean SCC, respectively. Although 4 cross-sectional studies reported positive associations between THK and SCC, these associations were possibly spurious because confounding factors, such as parity, were not considered in the analyses. Results of the reviewed studies suggest that severe THK is a risk factor for both CM and SCM, as defined by microbiological examination of milk, SCC thresholds, or mean SCC. The effect of severe THK on both contagious (especially Staphylococcus aureus) and environmental CM or SCM emphasizes the importance of teat health for mastitis control. Four studies demonstrated that quarters with mild THK had lower prevalence of intramammary infection or lower mean SCC than quarters with no THK, suggesting that development of mild THK, as a physiological response to milking, can have a protective effect. Dairy consultants should focus on monitoring and minimizing occurrence of severe THK to prevent CM and SCM.},

FINDINGS: Culture influences attitudes and preferences towards robots, but due to the limitations of the reviewed studies, concrete conclusions cannot be made. More consistent evidence was found with regard to the influence of culture on nonverbal behaviors and communication styles, with people being more accepting of a robot that behaved more closely to their own culture. CONCLUSIONS: The research field of human-robot interaction provides the current evidence on the influence that culture has on attitudes towards humanoid and animal-like robots, but more research that is guided by strong theoretical frameworks is needed.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic search for all controlled trials (up to March 2017) that assessed the antiobesity effects of P. ginseng in animal obesity models in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. The primary outcome was final body weight measured at the longest follow-up time after administration of the intervention. The secondary outcome was the lipid profile. We assessed methodological quality using the SYRCLE risk of bias tool, and RevMan 5.3 was used to perform a meta-analysis. Finally, a subgroup analysis of parameters including intervention duration, animal models, and type of ginseng was performed. RESULT: We identified 16 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Data from the meta-analysis indicated that the intervention group had a significantly lower body weight than the control group (SMD: -1.50, 95\% CI: -1.90 to -1.11, χ(2): 78.14, P {\textless} 0.0001, I(2) = 58\%). Final body weight was lower in an animal obesity model induced by high-fat diet than in genetic models. Also the intervention group had a significantly higher serum HDL level and lower serum LDL, TG, and TC level than the control group. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis indicated that oral administration of P. ginseng significantly inhibits weight gain and improves serum lipid profiles in animal obesity models.

It also inhibits Wallerian degeneration and recovers nerve conduction. This systemic review, performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, describes and summarizes published studies on PEG treatment efficiency in various nerve injury types and repair techniques. Sixteen original experimental studies in animal models and one in humans were analyzed. PEG treatment superiority was reported in almost all experiments (based on favorable electrophysiological, histological, or behavioral results). To date, only one study attempted to transfer the procedure into the clinical phase. However, some technical aspects, e.g., the maximal delay between trauma and successful treatment, await determination.

METHODS: Initial screening used key term searches in PubMed and bioRxiv, and a review of the literature lists of relevant papers. We included only studies where safety assessment was performed, and this results in 33 studies, both in humans and animals. RESULTS: Adverse effects of TFUS were very rare. At high stimulation intensity and/or rate, TFUS may cause haemorrhage, cell death or damage, and unintentional blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening. TFUS may also unintentionally affect long-term neural activity and behaviour. A variety of methods was used mainly in rodents to evaluate these adverse effects, including tissue staining, magnetic resonance imaging, temperature measurements and monitoring of neural activity and behaviour. In 30 studies, adverse effects were absent, even though at least one Food and Drug Administration (FDA) safety index was frequently exceeded. Two studies reported microhaemorrhages after long or relatively intense stimulation above safety limits. Another study reported BBB opening and neuronal damage in a control condition, which intentionally and substantially exceeded the safety limits. CONCLUSION: Most studies point towards a favourable safety profile of TFUS. Further investigations are warranted to establish a solid safety framework for the therapeutic window of TFUS to reliably avoid adverse effects while ensuring neural effectiveness. The comparability across studies should be improved by a more standardized reporting of TFUS parameters.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consortium for e-Resources in Agriculture, India, Google Scholar, PubMed, annual reports of All India Coordinated Research Project on Animal Disease Monitoring and Surveillance, and All India Animal Disease database of NIVEDI (NADRES) were used for searching and retrieval of CSF prevalence data (seroprevalence, virus antigen, and virus nucleic acid detection) in India using a search strategy combining keywords and related database-specific subject terms from January 2011 to December 2015 in English only. RESULTS: A total of 22 data reports containing 6,158 samples size from 18 states of India were used for the quantitative synthesis, and overall 37\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]=0.24, 0.51) CSF prevalence in India was estimated. The data were classified into 4 different geographical zones of the country: 20\% (95\% CI=0.05, 0.55), 31\% (95\% CI=0.18, 0.47), 55\% (95\% CI=0.32, 0.76), and 34\% (95\% CI=0.14, 0.62). CSF prevalence was estimated in northern, eastern, western, and southern regions, respectively.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: With cannabis consumption on the rise and use prominent among males of reproductive age it is essential to understand the potential impact of cannabis on male fertility. We reviewed the literature regarding the effects of cannabis on male fertility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a literature search using PubMed®/MEDLINE® to identify relevant studies of the effects of cannabis on male fertility. Relevant studies were identified and reviewed. RESULTS: The strongest evidence of cannabis induced alterations in male fertility is in the category of semen parameters. Research supports a role for cannabis in reducing sperm count and concentration, inducing abnormalities in sperm morphology, reducing sperm motility and viability, and inhibiting capacitation and fertilizing capacity. Animal models demonstrate a role for cannabis in testicular atrophy, and reduced libido and sexual function but to our knowledge these results have not yet been replicated in human studies. Studies of hormonal changes suggest inconclusive effects on testosterone levels, lowered luteinizing hormone levels and unchanged follicle-stimulating hormone levels. CONCLUSIONS: Current research suggests that cannabis may negatively impact male fertility. Further studies are needed to validate that robust findings in animal models will carry over into human experience. Clinicians should be aware of these potential effects when prescribing medical marijuana therapies to men of reproductive age, and they should consider the degree of cannabis use as a possible component of a complete male infertility workup.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Geophagy, the intentional consumption of earth, is widely practiced among humans and other mammals, but its causes are not well understood. Given the growing number of reports of geophagy among nonhuman primates (NHP), we sought to (1) advance and codify our understanding of the patterns and functional and evolutionary significance of geophagy among NHP and (2) provide a research agenda for a more unified approach to its study. METHODS: We systematically reviewed all available literature on NHP geophagy, extracted available data on taxa, geography, climate, diet, sex, age-class, reproductive status, and the characteristics of the earth. We used these data to evaluate three major hypotheses about geophagy, that it is protective, provides mineral supplementation, and is nonadaptive. RESULTS: We identified 287 accounts of geophagy among 136 species, adding 79 new primate species to the list of those considered in prior reviews. Nineteen percent of species were in the suborder Strepsirrhini, while 81\% were in the suborder Haplorrhini. There were reports of geophagy from 9 of the 17 families and 39 of the 76 genera currently recognized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. DISCUSSION: The limited evidence suggests that geophagy is adaptive, and provides protection and mineral supplementation. We specify the behavioral, dietary, and soil data required to more rigorously investigate these hypotheses across representative species of all taxonomic groups, geographical regions, and dietary classification. Given the plausibility of geophagy for maintaining the health of both wild and captive populations, we urge further study and conservation of geophagy sites.},

	abstract = {For the past two decades, biomimetic high-density lipoproteins (b-HDL) have been used for various drug delivery applications. The b-HDL mimic the endogenous HDL, and therefore possess many attractive features for drug delivery, including high biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ability to transport and deliver their cargo (e.g. drugs and/or imaging agents) to specific cells and tissues that are recognized by HDL. The b-HDL designs reported in the literature often differ in size, shape, composition, and type of incorporated cargo. However, there exists only limited insight into how the b-HDL design dictates their biodistribution. To fill this gap, we conducted a comprehensive systematic literature search of biodistribution studies using various designs of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I)-based b-HDL (i.e. b-HDL with apoA-I, apoA-I mutants, or apoA-I mimicking peptides). We carefully screened 679 papers (search hits) for b-HDL biodistribution studies in mice, and ended up with 24 relevant biodistribution profiles that we compared according to b-HDL design. We show similarities between b-HDL biodistribution studies irrespectively of the b-HDL design, whereas the biodistribution of the b-HDL components (lipids and scaffold) differ significantly. The b-HDL lipids primarily accumulate in liver, while the b-HDL scaffold primarily accumulates in the kidney. Furthermore, both b-HDL lipids and scaffold accumulate well in the tumor tissue in tumor-bearing mice. Finally, we present essential considerations and strategies for b-HDL labeling, and discuss how the b-HDL biodistribution can be tuned through particle design and administration route. Our meta-analysis and discussions provide a detailed overview of the fate of b-HDL in mice that is highly relevant when applying b-HDL for drug delivery or in vivo imaging applications.},

Different types of environmental enrichment have undergone evaluation. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of the effect of environmental enrichment on leg health in broiler chickens. The evaluation of leg health included measures of the entire leg and foot, and behavioural, pathological and physical measures. Six types of environmental enrichment were selected for inclusion: light programme, intensity of light, stocking density, perches, straw bales and separation of resources. For each type, a systematic literature search was performed. The review included 62 studies; 56 randomised trials and six cross-sectional studies. An assessment of the methodological quality of all 56 randomised trials was performed with some reporting deficits regarding occurrence of blinding, randomisation and reliability of measures. Provision of perches and increased intensity of light only displayed limited effectiveness in improving leg health and both mainly affected contact dermatitis. In contrast, there was evidence that a lowered stocking density and a dark/light schedule could improve leg health. Few studies have been carried out on the effect of straw bales and separation of resources. The few studies done have, however, shown that both types of enrichment can be effective in improving leg health. In conclusion, identifying and providing the optimal types of enrichment for broilers will reduce leg problems and increase mobility, thereby improving the welfare of the birds.},

	abstract = {Brucellosis is a neglected zoonotic disease of remarkable importance worldwide. The focus of this systematic review was to investigate occupational brucellosis and to identify the main infection risks for each group exposed to the pathogen. Seven databases were used to identify papers related to occupational brucellosis: CABI, Cochrane, Pubmed, Scielo, Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science. The search resulted in 6123 studies, of which 63 were selected using the quality assessment tools guided from National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Case Report Guidelines (CARE). Five different job-related groups were considered greatly exposed to the disease: rural workers, abattoir workers, veterinarians and veterinary assistants, laboratory workers and hunters. The main risk factors and exposure sources involved in the occupational infection observed from the analysis of the articles were direct contact with animal fluids, failure to comply with the use of personal protective equipment, accidental exposure to live attenuated anti-brucellosis vaccines and non-compliance with biosafety standards. Brucella species frequently isolated from job-related infection were Brucella melitensis, Brucella abortus, Brucella suis and Brucella canis. In addition, a meta-analysis was performed using the case-control studies and demonstrated that animal breeders, laboratory workers and abattoir workers have 3.47 [95\% confidence interval (CI); 1.47-8.19] times more chance to become infected with Brucella spp. than others individuals that have no contact with the possible sources of infection. This systematic review improved the understanding of the epidemiology of brucellosis as an occupational disease. Rural workers, abattoir workers, veterinarians, laboratory workers and hunters were the groups more exposed to occupational Brucella spp. infection. Moreover, it was observed that the lack of knowledge about brucellosis among frequently exposed professionals, in addition to some behaviors, such as negligence in the use of individual and collective protective measures, increases the probability of infection.},

	abstract = {Dermatophytoses are inflammatory cutaneous mycoses caused by dermatophyte fungi of the genera Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton that affect both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. With therapeutic failure, dermatophytoses can become chronic and recurrent. This is partly due to their ability to develop biofilms, microbial communities involved in a polymeric matrix attached to biotic or abiotic surfaces, contributing to fungal resistance. This review presents evidence accumulated in recent years on antidermatophyte biofilm activity. The following databases were used: Web of Science, Medline/PubMed (via the National Library of Medicine), Embase, and Scopus. Original articles published between 2011 and 2020, emphasizing the antifungal activity of conventional and new drugs against dermatophyte biofilms were eligible. A total of 11 articles met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed - the studies used in vitro and ex vivo (fragments of nails and hair) experimental models. The articles focused on reports of antibiofilm activity for conventional antifungals, natural drugs, and new therapeutic tools. The strains reported on were T. mentagrophytes, T. rubrum, T. tonsurans, M. canis, and M. gypseum. Between the studies, the wide variability of experimental conditions in vitro and ex vivo was observed. The data suggest the need for methodological standardization (at some minimum). This review systematically presents current studies involving agents that present antibiofilm activity against dermatophytes; and an overview of the ideal in vitro and ex vivo experimental conditions to guarantee biofilm formation that may assist future research. LAY ABSTRACT: This review presents the current studies on the antibiofilm activities of drugs against dermatophytes and ideal experimental conditions, which might guarantee in vitro and ex vivo biofilm formation.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) intervention programme, with pre- and post-data, based on EAAT, (b) children with ADHD and (c) articles written in English. RESULTS: A total of 9 articles were found that meet the inclusion criteria. The evidence level was C for 7 studies and B for 2 studies. The level of conclusion was 3. DISCUSSION: There are few studies with high methodological quality, and there is a high heterogeneity in the variables included, what make that the level of evidence and conclusion are low. CONCLUSION: There is no account with enough studies of high methodological quality to determine whether EAAT is an effective intervention for the treatment in children with ADHD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Millions of people in the world suffer from chronic wounds of different etiologies such as diabetic foot and leg ulcers, without solutions nowadays. Molecules obtained from plants offer an alternative to aid wound healing. Strong evidence about essential oils (EO) anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties is thoroughly described in literature and their chemical compositions are well characterized. More recently, EO effects in experimental wounds have begun to be analyzed. AIM: We aim to summarize the evidence of EO in experimental wounds, and the possibility of combining them with biopolymers commonly used in skin regeneration. METHODS: Electronic databases such as ScienceDirect, PubMed and Scopus were used to search scientific contributions until March 2017, using relevant keywords. In a first step, literature focusing on EO and/or mono- or sesqui-terpenoids effects in rodent wounds was identified and summarized. In all cases, chemical structures and EO composition were detailed, as well as references to in vitro activities previously determined, e.g. antibacterial, antioxidant or anti-inflammatory. In a second step, scientific literature devoted to combine EO and biopolymers with the focus set on wound healing innovations, was collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Treatments with EO from species of genders Lavandula, Croton, Blumea, Eucalyptus, Pinus, Cymbopogon, Eucalyptus, Cedrus, Abies, Rosmarinus, Origanum, Salvia and Plectranthus, have shown positive results in rodent wounds. All of these EO were mainly composed by monoterpenoids-thymol, 1,8-cineole, linalool-or monoterpenes, as limonene or pinenes. Experimental wounds in rodents have shown faster closure rate, better collagen deposition and/or enhanced fibroblasts proliferation. In blends with biopolymers, several EO combined with chitosan, alginate, gelatin or collagen, were processed to give active films or nanofibers, with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory or antimicrobial activities. Curiously, all of these works were carried out since 2010. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant evidence about the effectivity of EO as wound healers. The incorporation of EO into a polymer matrix that contributes to wound healing is still incipient. However, scientific based evidence of the EO incorporation in resorbable polymeric scaffolds was found and analyzed herein. In summary, EO-biopolymer dressings or scaffolds have become promising artifacts regarding wound treatments, especially in chronic wounds, where treating infection and inflammation are still important issues.},

	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a chronic hyperglycemic condition due to progressively impaired glucose regulation. Momordica charantia L. could potentially improve hyperglycemia because its fruit extracts can alleviate insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, and increase serum insulin level. We evaluated the effect of M. charantia L. in comparison with a vehicle on glycemic control in animal models of type 2 diabetes mellitus. MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL databases were searched without language restriction through April 2019. About 66 studies involving 1861 animals that examined the effect of M. charantia L. on type 2 diabetes mellitus were included. Fruits and seed extracts reduced fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c in comparison to vehicle control: (42 studies, 815 animals; SMD, -6.86 [95\% CI; -7.95, -5.77], 3 studies, 59 animals; SMD; -7.76 [95\% CI; -12.50, -3.01]) respectively. Also, the extracts have hepato-renal protective effects at varying doses and duration of administration. Despite the observed significant glycemic control effect, poor methodological quality calls for future researches to focus on standardizing extract based on chemical markers and adopt measures to improve the quality of preclinical studies such as sample size calculation, randomization, and blinding.},

	abstract = {Immunosenescence, the decline in immune defense with age, is an important mortality source in elderly humans but little is known of immunosenescence in wild animals. We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed evidence for age-related changes in immunity in captive and free-living populations of wild species (321 effect sizes in 62 studies across 44 species of mammals, birds and reptiles). As in humans, senescence was more evident in adaptive (acquired) than innate immune functions. Declines were evident for cell function (antibody response), the relative abundance of naïve immune cells and an in vivo measure of overall immune responsiveness (local response to phytohaemagglutinin injection). Inflammatory markers increased with age, similar to chronic inflammation associated with human immunosenescence. Comparisons across taxa and captive vs free-living animals were difficult due to lack of overlap in parameters and species measured. Most studies are cross-sectional, which yields biased estimates of age-effects when immune function co-varies with survival. We therefore suggest longitudinal sampling approaches, and highlight techniques from human cohort studies that can be incorporated into ecological research. We also identify avenues to address predictions from evolutionary theory and the contribution of immunosenescence to age-related increases in disease susceptibility and mortality.},

In North Africa, cats have a particularly long record and occupy a specialized niche within many communities. This systematic review was conducted to analyze the current and historical literature documenting the breadth and variety of zoonoses in North Africa, specifically relating to the domesticated feline. Multiple electronic databases were searched on January 16, 2019, for published reports on feline zoonoses in North Africa. A total of 76 studies met the inclusion criteria for a full assessment. Articles selected for the review ranged in publication dates from 1939 to 2019 and included a case study, cross-sectional surveys, genomic analyses, and a book chapter. The most commonly studied pathogen was Toxoplasma gondii (n = 17) followed by a variety of helminths (n = 10). Of the countries in the target region, most publications were of studies conducted in Egypt (n = 53) followed by Tunisia (n = 12), Algeria (n = 11), Morocco (n = 5), and Libya (n = 3). The results of this review identify a variety of viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic zoonotic diseases associated with cats in North Africa, ranging from historically endemic diseases in both human and animal populations in the region, to emerging infections with recent confirmatory diagnoses. This review describes reported feline zoonoses in North Africa and provides recommendations for their prevention and control. In addition to vaccination campaigns for domesticated felines and postexposure prophylaxis for humans, prompt veterinary and medical care of exposure risks and subsequent infections are essential in limiting the zoonotic disease burden in North African communities of humans and cats.},

	volume = {15},
	issn = {1932-6203},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0237872},
	abstract = {Recent results have established that masticatory function plays a role not only in the balance of the stomatognathic system and in the central motor control, but also in the trophism of the hippocampus and in the cognitive activity. These implications have been shown in clinical studies and in animal researches as well, by means of histological, biochemical and behavioural techniques. This systematic review describes the effects of three forms of experimentally altered mastication, namely soft-diet feeding, molar extraction and bite-raising, on the trophism and function of the hippocampus in animal models. Through a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, OpenGray and GrayMatters, 645 articles were identified, 33 full text articles were assessed for eligibility and 28 articles were included in the review process. The comprehensiveness of reporting was evaluated with the ARRIVE guidelines and the risk of bias with the SYRCLE RoB tool. The literature reviewed agrees that a disturbed mastication is significantly associated with a reduced number of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in Cornu Ammonis (CA)1 and CA3, downregulation of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), reduced synaptic activity, reduced neurogenesis in the Dentate Gyrus (DG), glial proliferation, and reduced performances in behavioural tests, indicating memory impairment and reduced spatial orientation. Moreover, while the bite-raised condition, characterized by occlusal instability, is known to be a source of stress, soft-diet feeding and molar extractions were not consistently associated with a stress response. More research is needed to clarify this topic. The emerging role of chewing in the preservation of hippocampal trophism, neurogenesis and synaptic activity is worthy of interest and may contribute to the study of neurodegenerative diseases in new and potentially relevant ways.},

The search utilized the PubMed, CAB Abstracts and the University of Georgia's Galileo electronic databases using a combination of free text terms 'Ophthalmology', 'Intraocular Pressure', 'Anesthetic', 'Anesthesia', 'Canine' or 'Dog'. The time frame searched was from 1970 to October 2018. Any published research paper that dealt with sedatives or anesthetics administered systemically and the canine eye was evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of many anesthetic drugs in dogs with ocular pathology are largely unknown. Many anesthetic drugs do not induce clinically relevant changes in IOP in dogs with normal eyes, although some studies demonstrated results with statistically significant changes. The dose, route of administration, experimental conditions, drug combinations, timing of measurements, measurement technology and setting or individual animal characteristics may all produce some heterogeneity in results from multiple studies.},

Lack of animal-source protein has been identified as a risk, but effects of animal protein supplementation are not well established. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate effects of animal protein supplementation in mothers, preterm infants, and term infants/children on birth and growth outcomes. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Web of Science, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature were searched for randomized controlled trials of animal protein supplementation in mothers or infants and children (≤age 5 y), evaluating measures of anthropometry (≤age 18 y). Main outcomes included birth weight, low birth weight, small for gestational age at birth; height, height-for-age, weight, weight-for-age, weight-for-length, stunting, and wasting ≤18 y of age. Data were extracted independently in duplicate, and findings pooled using inverse variance meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was explored using I2, stratified analysis, and meta-regression, and publication bias by funnel plots, Egger's test, and fill/trim methods. RESULTS: Of 6808 unique abstracts and 357 full-text articles, 62 trials were included. The 62 trials comprised over 30,000 participants across 5 continents, including formula-based supplementation in infants and food-based supplementation in pregnancy and childhood. Maternal supplementation increased birth weight by 0.06 kg, and both formula and food-based supplementation in term infants/young children increased weight by ≤0.14 kg. Neither formula nor food-based supplementation for term infants/young children increased height, whereas the height-for-age z-score was increased in the food-based (+0.06 z-score) but not formula-based (-0.11 z-score) trials reporting this outcome. In term infants, the weight-for-length z-score was increased in trials of formula (+0.24 z-score) and food supplementation (+0.06 z-score), whereas food supplementation was also associated with reduced odds of stunting (-13\%). CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of protein from animal-source foods generally increased weight and weight-for-length in children, but with more limited effects on other growth outcomes such as attained height.},

Although it is effective against viruses and bacteria, the use of disinfectants in water has little or no effect on T. gondii oocysts. The use of radiation and pressure were effective in inactivating oocysts, as these treatments do not include changes in temperature, they can be used in foods for raw consumption, such as vegetables, as it will not cause substantially changes in their physical and chemical characteristics.

	abstract = {Understanding the structure of the respiratory microbiome and its complex interactions with opportunistic pathogenic bacteria has become a topic of great scientific and economic interest in livestock production, given the severe consequences of respiratory disease on animal health and welfare. The present review focuses on the microbial structures of the porcine upper and lower airways, and the factors that influence microbiome development and onset of respiratory disease. Following a literature search on PubMed and Scopus, 21 articles were selected based on defined exclusion criteria (20 studies performed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and one by shotgun metagenomics). Analysis of the selected literature indicated that the microbial structure of the upper respiratory tract undergoes a remarkable evolution after birth and tends to stabilise around weaning. Antimicrobial treatment, gaseous ammonia concentration, diet and floor type are amongst the recognized environmental factors influencing microbiome structure. The predominant phyla of the upper respiratory tract are Proteobacteria and Firmicutes with significant differences at the genus level between the nasal and the oropharyngeal cavity. Only five studies investigated the lower respiratory tract and their results diverged in relation to the relative abundance of these two phyla and even more in the composition of the lung microbiome at the genus level, likely because of methodological differences. Reduced diversity and imbalanced microbial composition are associated with an increased risk of respiratory disease. However, most studies presented methodological pitfalls concerning specimen collection, sequencing target and depth, and lack of quality control. Standardization of sampling and sequencing procedures would contribute to a better understanding of the structure of the microbiota inhabiting the lower respiratory tract and its relationship with pig health and disease.},

	abstract = {Recurrent infections with herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the orofacial (cold sores), ocular or genital region are common and sometimes disabling, calling for an effective preventive intervention. The bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine has beneficial off-target effects that might impact recurrence of HSV infections. In this systematic review, Medline, EMBASE, and PubMed were searched in June 2020; 16 articles were deemed relevant comprising eight animal and eight human studies (301 patients). In animals, BCG administration led to a 1.9 to 5.5-fold increase in survival rate following HSV challenge (vaginal, corneal, or intraperitoneal inoculation). This beneficial effect was influenced by the dose of BCG (higher better), mode of administration (intradermal better than intraperitoneal), and the interval between vaccination and viral challenge (at least 6 days required). In nonrandomized human studies (that failed to control for a placebo effect), BCG vaccination appeared beneficial in 78\% of adults with recurrent herpes genitalis or labialis, with 37\% being recurrence-free for an extended period, 41\% experiencing less frequent or severe episodes, and only 22\% reporting no change. This clinical benefit is consistent with the findings of immunological sub-studies. In the two studies restricted to recurrent herpes labialis, 94\% appeared to benefit from BCG. The one randomized controlled trial used an intervention in the control group that has immunomodulatory effects thus limiting interpretation. In conclusion, BCG vaccine is a potential, safe, affordable and readily available candidate intervention to decrease the high burden of disease associated with HSV infection and recurrences, but properly controlled randomized trials are required.},

DATA EXTRACTION: The first author, year of publication, study design, characteristics of animals and humans, intervention groups, dose of hesperidin, route of administration, duration of the intervention, cardiovascular risk biomarkers assessed, and results observed were extracted from the included articles. RESULTS: A total of 12 animal studies and 11 randomized clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. In the animal studies, the glucose, total and LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels decreased with chronic flavonoid consumption. In the human studies, endothelial function improved with flavonoid consumption, whereas no conclusive results were observed for the other biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Animal studies have revealed that hesperidin and hesperetin consumption reduces glucose levels and various lipid profile parameters. However, a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn from the existing human clinical trials. Further research is needed to confirm whether the findings observed in animal models can also be observed in humans. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: Prospero registration number CRD42018088942.},

	abstract = {Background: Diseases of the pharynx and upper esophageal sphincter can result in debilitating respiratory difficulty, dysphagia or a combination of both. An exact diagnosis is essential to properly prognosticate and guide therapy. Videofluoroscopic assessment of the pharynx and upper esophageal sphincter with or without orally administered contrast material is the diagnostic of choice for many diseases as both anatomic and functional information is gleaned. The purpose of this review is to assess for continuity in imaging protocols across institutions and to record quantitative and qualitative parameters used for analysis of videofluoroscopy of the pharynx and upper esophageal sphincter in dogs. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed including articles published in peer-reviewed veterinary journals involving the topic of videofluoroscopy of the pharynx and upper esophageal sphincter through August 1, 2018. Specifics of study acquisition technique were recorded. Quantitative and qualitative videofluoroscopic parameters were recorded and compared across institutions where appropriate using one-way ANOVA with p ≤ 0.05 being considered significant. Results: Videofluoroscopy of the pharynx and upper esophageal sphincter is performed either in right lateral or standing postures depending on the institution. Bolus size and consistency used during contrast videofluoroscopy of swallowing differs between institutions. Some institutions evaluate videofluoroscopic studies using qualitative criteria while others apply quantitative measures. Reported quantitative measures include inter-swallow interval, swallow rate, jaw cycles per swallow ratio, time to upper esophageal opening, maximal pharyngeal contraction, maximum laryngeal excursion, upper esophageal closure, epiglottic re-opening, and pharyngeal constriction ratio. Measurement outcomes are significantly different between institutions and when bolus size/consistency is variable when assessing healthy dogs. Conclusions: The current peer-reviewed literature on fluoroscopic evaluation of the pharynx and UES in dogs shows a lack of standardization regarding imaging protocol. There is not a standard set of quantitative criteria applied amongst the institutions and there are significant differences in the outcomes obtained from videofluoroscopic assessment of swallowing suggesting significant inter-observer or inter-institutional variability. A consensus statement regarding imaging protocol and what parameters should be used to interpret airway and swallowing videofluoroscopic studies of the pharynx and UES in dogs is needed along with targeted analysis of observer variability.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parasitic infections are responsible for a significant burden of disease worldwide as a result of international travel and immigration. More accurate diagnostic tools are necessary in support to parasite control and elimination programmes in endemic regions as well as for rapid case detection in non-endemic areas. Digital PCR (dPCR) is a powerful technology with recent applications in parasitology. AIMS: This review provides for the first time an overview of dPCR as a novel technology applied to detection of parasitic infections, and highlights the most relevant potential benefits of this assay. SOURCES: Peer-reviewed literature pertinent to this review based on PubMed, Cochrane and Embase databases as well as laboratory experience of authors. CONTENT: Among the 86 studies retrieved, 17 used the dPCR applied to parasites belonging to protozoa (8), helminths (8) and arthropods (1) of clinical human interest. dPCR was adopted in four studies, respectively, for Plasmodium and Schistosoma japonicum. dPCR led to clear advantages over quantitative real-time PCR in P. falciparum and spp., and in S. japonicum showing higher sensitivity; and in Cryptosporidium with higher stability to inhibitors from stool. For all parasites, dPCR allows absolute quantitation without the need of a standard curve. Various dPCR platforms were used. A few critical factors need consideration: DNA load, choice of platform and reaction optimization. IMPLICATIONS: Owing to its sensitivity and quantitative characteristics, dPCR is a potential candidate to become an appealing new method among the molecular technologies for parasite detection and quantitative analysis in the future. In general, it has more applications than genomic DNA detection only, such as quantitation in mixed infections, gene expression and mutation analysis. dPCR should be considered in malaria screening and diagnosis as a complement to routine assays and in schistosomiasis elimination programmes. Standardized strategies and further studies are needed for the integration of dPCR in routine clinical laboratory.},

Linear mixed models were used to analyze the data. Vitamin E supplementation did not influence growth performance, as the estimated slopes were not different from zero, with P-values equal to 0.92 for final body weight, 0.81 for average daily gain, 0.31 for daily feed intake, and 0.83 for feed conversion ratio. Dietary vitamin E supplementation increased the vitamin E content in the muscle (P=0.001), did not change the polyunsaturated fatty acid concentration, and decreased the lipid peroxidation (P=0.01). The immune response was improved, the heterophil to lymphocyte ratio was constant, and the total immunoglobulins were increased (P=0.037) by dietary vitamin E supplementation. With regard to broiler chicken performance, there seemed to be no relationship between dietary vitamin E supplementation and growth performance. There is ample indication that meat quality and immune response could be improved by dietary vitamin E supplementation.},

	abstract = {Background: Antimicrobial resistance is a serious public health problem worldwide. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli strains simultaneously isolated from humans, animals, food, and the environment. Methods: Studies on PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library published from January 1, 2000 to January 1, 2018 were searched. The quality of the included studies was assessed by the modified critical appraisal checklist recommended by the Joanna Briggs Institute. All analyses were conducted using Biostat's Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 2.0. Depending on the heterogeneity test for each antibiotic, we used a random- or fixed-effect model for pooled prevalence of drug resistance. Studies were eligible if they had investigated and reported resistance in two or more isolation sources (human, animal, food, or environment). To decrease heterogeneity and bias, we excluded studies that had reported E. coli drug resistance isolated from one source only. We included publications that reported drug resistance with minimum inhibitory concentration or disk diffusion method (DDM) as antibiotic-susceptibility tests. Results: Of the 39 included studies, 20 used the DDM and 19 minimum inhibitory concentration for their antibiotic-susceptibility testing. Colistin had the lowest prevalence, with 0.8\% (95\% CI 0.2\%-3.8\%) and amoxicillin the highest, with 70.5\% (95\% CI 57.5\%-81\%) in isolated human E. coli strains tested with the DDM. To assess historical changes in antimicrobial drug resistance, subgroup analysis from 2000 to 2018 showed a significant increase in ciprofloxacin resistance. Conclusion: Monitoring and evaluating antibiotic-sensitivity patterns and preparation of reliable antibiotic strategies may lead to better outcomes for inhibition and control of E. coli infections in different regions of the world.},

Results: A total of 15 observational prospective and retrospective studies including 258,298 dogs, cats, rabbits, and pigs were included. The analysis found consistency between the studies showing that dogs, cats and rabbits with an ASA-PS ≥III had 3.26 times (95\% CI = 3.04-3.49), 4.83 times (95\% CI = 3.10-7.53), and 11.31 times (95\% CI = 2.70-47.39), respectively, the risk of anesthesia-related death within 24 h (dogs) and 72 h (cats and rabbits) after anesthesia compared with those with an ASA PS {\textless}III. In addition, the analysis showed that dogs and cats with ASA PS ≥III had 2.34 times the risk of developing severe hypothermia during anesthesia (95\% CI = 1.82-3.01). Conclusions: The simple and practical ASA PS was shown to be a valuable prognostic tool and can be recommended to identify an increased risk of anesthetic mortality until 24-72 h after anesthesia, and a greater risk of development severe intraoperative hypothermia.},

OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between compressive pressure and its duration in cauda equina compression, and the effects of subsequent decompression, on neurophysiological function, and pathophysiology in animal studies. We further aim to investigate these relationships with systemic blood pressure to assess whether a vascular component in the underlying mechanism may contribute to the clinical heterogeneity of this disease. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The complex relationship between preoperative factors and outcomes in cauda equina syndrome (CES) suggests heterogeneity within CES which may inform better understanding of pathophysiological process, their effect on neurological function, and prognosis. METHODS: Systematic review identified 17 relevant studies including 422 animals and reporting electrophysiological measures (EP), histopathology, and blood flow. Modeling using meta-regression analyzed the relationship between compressive pressure, duration of compression, and electrophysiological function in both compression and decompression studies. RESULTS: Modeling suggested that electrophysiological dysfunction in acute cauda equina compression has a sigmoidal response, with particularly deterioration when mean arterial blood pressure is exceeded and, additionally, sustained for approximately 1 hour. Accounting for pressure and duration may help risk-stratify patients pre-decompression. Outcomes after decompression appeared to be related more to the degree of compression, where exceeding systolic blood pressure tended to result in an irreversible lesion, rather than duration of compression. Prognosis was most strongly associated with residual pre-decompression function. CONCLUSION: Compressive pressure influences effects and outcomes of cauda equina compression. We suggest the presence of two broad phenotypic groups within CES defined by the degree of ischaemia as a potential explanatory pathophysiological mechanism. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1.},

This is the first integrative review of literature on veterinary communication. Applying the PRISMA model, the PubMed, PsychInfo and ERIC databases were searched using keywords such as 'veterinary', 'vet', 'communication' and 'interaction' for related articles published between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2018. RESULTS: Keyword searching through the databases yielded 1572 related studies. Only 48 of these studies were included in our analysis after an in-depth review by two independent reviewers using the critical appraisal skills Programme frameworks with high inter-rater reliability (Cohen's kappa coefficient κ {\textgreater} 0.8). The existing body of research on veterinary communication can be classified into three major areas: (a) client-veterinarian communication, (b) cross-disciplinary communication in a professional veterinarian team and (c) training of veterinary communication skills. This review details the complexity and heterogeneity of agenda in the field of veterinary communication. The included studies indicate that veterinary practitioners are not equipped with specific communication skills to address different agendas in veterinary communication. The veterinary curriculum should include a component on communication training that can help veterinary students acquire necessary communication skills that allow them to effectively communicate with clients and other professionals CONCLUSION: This review detailed the complexity of agendas in the field of veterinary communication. The results indicate that veterinary practitioners can further benefit from training on specific communication skills that address the agendas found in veterinary communication research. Furthermore, the veterinary curriculum should include a component on communication training that equips veterinary students with the necessary communication skills that allow them to effectively communicate with different stakeholders such as clients and colleagues with and across the field of veterinary science.},

	abstract = {A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to predict and identify ways to increase conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) formation in ruminant-derived products to treat human health issues with dietary tannins. The objective was to compare and confirm the effects of dietary tannins on CLA formation by analyzing in vitro and/or in vivo studies. We reported the results of the meta-analysis based on numerical data from 38 selected publications consisting of 3712 treatments. Generally, via multiple pathways, the CLA formation increased when dietary tannins increased. Concurrently, dietary tannins increased Δ9 desaturation and the CLA indices in milk and meat (P {\textless} 0.05 and P {\textless} 0.001, with average R2 values of 0.23 and 0.44, respectively), but they did not change the rumen fermentation characteristics, including total volatile fatty acids (mmol/L) and their acid components. In vitro observations may accurately predict in vivo results. Unfortunately, there was no relationship between in vitro observations and in vivo results (R2 {\textless} 0.10), indicating that it is difficult to predict CLA formation in vivo considering in vitro observations. According to the statistical meta-analysis results regarding animal aspects, the ranges of tannin levels required for CLA formation in vitro and in vivo were approximately 0.1-20 g/kg dry matter (DM) (P {\textless} 0.001) and 2.1-80 g/kg DM (P {\textless} 0.001), respectively. In conclusion, the in vivo method was more suitable for the direct observation of fatty acid transformation than the in vitro method.},

	abstract = {Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is the commonest food allergy in infancy and is associated with significant health burden. Given their immune modulatory properties, probiotics have been proposed as a strategy for management of CMPA. We aimed to systematically review efficacy and safety of probiotics in the management of CMPA. Databases PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Library, and Google scholar were searched in August 2018 for randomized controlled trials (RCT) of probiotic supplementation as an adjunct in the management of infants with suspected/proven CMPA. Primary outcomes were resolution of hematochezia and acquisition of tolerance to CMP at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Secondary outcomes included effect on allergic symptoms (SCORAD index), growth, gut microbiota, and adverse effects. A total of 10 RCTs (n = 845; probiotics, 422; control, 423) with low to unclear risk of bias were included. Meta-analysis showed probiotic supplementation was not associated with earlier resolution of hematochezia (n = 87; RR: 1.45 (95\% CI: 0.96-2.18), p = 0.08; level of evidence (LOE), very low), in presumed CMPA. In confirmed CMPA, probiotics were associated with higher rate of acquisition of tolerance to CMP at the end of 3 years compared with placebo (N = 493; RR, 1.47; 95\% CI, (1.17-1.84); p = 0.0009; LOE, low]. Meta-analysis was not possible for other outcomes. There were no probiotic related adverse effects. Conclusion: Limited low-quality evidence indicates that probiotic supplementation may be associated with earlier acquisition of tolerance to CMP in children with CMPA. Large well-designed trials are essential to confirm these findings. What is Known: • Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is one of the commonest food allergies in children. CMPA is associated with significant socioeconomic burden. • Elimination diet and extensively hydrolyzed formula is the mainstay of the management of CMPA. What is New: • This first systematic review of randomized controlled trials shows that probiotics as an adjuvant can lead to earlier acquisition of tolerance to CMP in children at 36 months of age. However, the evidence is low quality and influenced by data from one large study. • Probiotic supplementation was not associated with earlier resolution of hematochezia.},

In order to fully evaluate the seroprevalence and risk factor of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection among in mainland China, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. In this review, we searched literature on the seroprevalence of H5N1 infection among humans in mainland China from 1 January 1997 to 20 October 2018 in English and Chinese databases, including PubMed, Google scholar, Cochrane library, Clinical Trial, VIP, CNKI and WanFang database. We made a selection according to the title and the abstract of paper, and then, we excluded duplicated literature, and data incomplete literature according to the exclusion criteria we formulated. Finally, we extracted how many humans have H5N1 infection from the obtained studies to establish the seroprevalence of H5N1 infection among humans in mainland China. A total of 56 studies (including data of 35,159 humans) were compliant with our criteria. In China, the overall seroprevalence of H5N1 infection among humans was 2.45\% (862/35,159), while the seroprevalence of H5N1 infection among humans from central China was 7.32\% (213/2,911), higher than those in other regions of China. The seroprevalence of H5N1 infection was associated with test method, sampling time and demographic characteristics of humans. However, there was no significant difference in the effect of gender on the seroprevalence of H5N1 among humans in China. The purpose of this review was to better understand the real infection rate of H5N1 virus among humans and evaluate the potential risk factors for the zoonotic spread of H5N1 virus to humans. Sufficient epidemiological data are important to explore and understand the prevalent status of AIVs throughout the country and to disease control.},

	abstract = {Since 2004, the national schistosomiasis control strategy in China has shifted from the morbidity control strategy (conventional strategy) to an integrated strategy (new strategy). We investigated the effectiveness of the new strategy and compared it against the conventional strategy. We retrieved from electronic databases the literature regarding the new strategy published from 2000 to 2017. The effect of the new or conventional strategy on infection by Schistosoma japonicum of humans and snails (Oncomelania hupensis) was evaluated with pooled log relative risk (logRR). A total of only eight eligible publications were included in the final meta-analysis. The results showed that implementation of the new strategy reduced the infection risk by 3-4 times relative to the conventional strategy. More specifically, the conventional strategy caused a reduction in both human (logRR = 0.56, 95\% CI: 0.12-0.99) and snail infections (logRR = 0.34, 95\% CI: -0.69-1.37), while the new strategy also significantly reduced both human (logRR = 1.89, 95\% CI: 1.33-2.46) and snail infections (logRR = 1.61, 95\% CI: 1.06-2.15). In contrast to the conventional strategy, the new strategy appeared more effective to control both human (logRR difference = 1.32, 95\% CI: 0.78-1.86) and snail infections (logRR difference = 1.53, 95\% CI: 0.76-2.31). Our data demonstrate that the new integrated strategy is highly effective to control the transmission of S. japonicum in China, and this strategy is recommended for schistosomiasis elimination in other affected regions across the world, with adaptation to local conditions.

Several attempts have been made to demonstrate motor function improvement in rats with SCI after transplantation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). This systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to summarize the effects of iPSC on locomotor recovery in rat models of SCI. METHODS: We searched the publications in the PubMed, Medline, Science Citation Index, Cochrane Library, CNKI, and Wan-fang databases and the China Biology Medicine disc. Results were analyzed by Review Manager 5.3.0. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. RESULTS: Six randomized controlled preclinical trials covering eight comparisons and including 212 rats were selected. The subgroup analyses were based on the following items: different SCI models, cell counts, iPSC sources, iPSC differentiations and transplantation methods. The pooled results indicated that iPSC transplantation significantly improved locomotor recovery of rats after SCI by sustaining beneficial effects, especially in the subgroups of contusion, moderate cell counts (5×105), source of human fetal lung fibroblasts, iPSC-neural precursors and intraspinal injection. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis of the effects of iPSC transplantation on locomotor function in SCI models is, to our knowledge, the first meta-analysis in this field. We conclude that iPSC transplantation improves locomotor recovery in rats with SCI, implicating this strategy as an effective therapy. However, more studies are required to validate our conclusions.},

DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases including PubMed, Science Citation Index, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Journals Full-text Database, China Biology Medicine disc, and Wanfang Database were searched to retrieve related studies published before September 2017. The MeSH terms (the Medical Subject Headings) such as "myelotomy", "spinal cord injuries", "rats", "randomized controlled trial" and all related entry terms were searched. DATA SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials using myelotomy for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury in rats were included. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores were adopted as the evaluation method. RevMan Software (version 5.3) was used for data processing. The χ(2) and I(2) tests were used to assess heterogeneity. Using a random-effects model, a subgroup analysis was conducted to analyze the source of the heterogeneity. OUTCOME MEASURES: Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores were observed 1-6 weeks after spinal cord injury. RESULTS: Six animal trials were included, using a total of 143 lab rats. The included trials were divided into two subgroups by injury degrees (moderate or severe). The pooled results showed that, 1-6 weeks after spinal cord injury, the overall Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan score was significantly higher in the myelotomy group than in the contusion group (weighted mean difference (WMD) = 0.60; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.23-0.97; P = 0.001; WMD = 2.10; 95\% CI: 1.56-2.64; P {\textless} 0.001; WMD = 2.65; 95\% CI: 1.73-3.57; P {\textless} 0.001; WMD = 1.66; 95\% CI: 0.80-2.52; P {\textless} 0.001; WMD = 2.09; 95\% CI: 0.92-3.26, P {\textless} 0.001; WMD = 2.25; 95\% CI: 1.06-3.44, P {\textless} 0.001). The overall heterogeneity was high (I(2) = 85\%; I(2) = 95\%; I(2) = 94\%; I(2) = 88\%; I(2) = 91\%; I(2) = 89\%). The results in the moderate injury subgroup showed that Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores were significantly higher in the myelotomy group than in the contusion group (WMD = 0.91, 95\% CI: 0.52-1.3, P {\textless} 0.001; WMD = 2.10; 95\% CI: 1.56-2.64, P {\textless} 0.001; WMD = 2.65; 95\% CI: 1.73-3.57, P {\textless} 0.001; WMD = 2.50, 95\% CI: 1.72-3.28, P {\textless} 0.001; WMD = 3.29, 95\% CI: 2.21-4.38, P {\textless} 0.001; WMD = 3.27; 95\% CI: 2.31-4.23, P {\textless} 0.001). The relevant heterogeneity was low. However, there were no significant differences in Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores between the myelotomy and contusion groups in the severe injury subgroup at 2 and 3 weeks after the injury (P = 0.75; P = 0.92). CONCLUSION: : To date, this is the first attempt to summarize the potential effect of myelotomy on locomotor recovery in rats with spinal cord injury. Our findings conclude that myelotomy promotes locomotor recovery in rats with spinal cord injury, especially in those with moderate injury.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis japonica is a zoonotic parasitic disease. After nearly 70 years of control efforts in China, Schistosomiasis transmission has been reduced to a much lower level. The absence or near absence of infections in humans or livestock, based on traditional fecal and serological tests, has made the targets and priorities of future control efforts difficult to determine. However, detection of schistosome cercariae in waters using sentinel mice could be an alternative way of identifying remaining foci of infection, or even serve as a tool for evaluation of control efficacy. This method has been employed in China over last forty years. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of the relevant research to investigate if infections in sentinel mice mirror the ongoing trend of schistosomiasis transmission in China. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of studies reporting infection rates of S. japonicum in sentinel mice in China before Sep 1, 2018 in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We retrieved all relative studies based on five databases (CNKI, WanFang, VIP, PubMed and Web of Science) and the reference lists of resulting articles. For each individual study, the infection rate in sentinel mice is presented together with its 95\% confidence interval (CI). Point estimates of the overall infection rates and their 95\% CIs were calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed according to study periods, seasons or regions. RESULTS: We identified 90 articles, including 290 studies covering eight endemic provinces. The overall rate in sentinel mice was 12.31\% (95\% CI: 10.14-14.65\%) from 1980 to 2018. The value of 3.66\% (95\% CI: 2.62-4.85\%) estimated in 2004 to 2018 was significantly lower than in 1980 to 2003 (22.96\%, 95\% CI: 19.25-26.89\%). The estimate was significantly higher in the middle and lower reaches than in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The highest estimates were obtained in Hunan (30.11\%, 95\% CI: 25.64-34.77\%) followed by Anhui (26.34\%, 95\% CI: 12.88-42.44\%) and then Jiangxi (13.73\%, 95\% CI: 6.71-22.56\%). Unlike the other provinces in the middle and lower reaches, no significant reduction was seen in Hubei after 2003. Even in Hubei two studies carried out after 2014 reported infections in sentinel mice, although no infected snails were reported across the province. Infections were most found in April (17.40\%, 95\% CI: 1.13-45.49\%), July (24.98\%, 95\% CI: 15.64-35.62\%) and October (17.08\%, 95\% CI 5.94-32.05\%). High degrees of heterogeneity were observed. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis provides a comprehensive analysis of schistosome infection in sentinel mice across China. The estimates largely mirror the ongoing trends of transmission in terms of periods and regions. Infections were most likely to occur in April, July and October. In areas where no infected snails were reported infections in sentinel mice were still observed. Due to the presence of snails and infected wildlife, detection of schistosomes in waters using such a highly sensitive method as the deployment of sentinel mice, remains of importance in schistosomiasis monitoring. We would suggest the current criteria for transmission interruption or elimination of schistosomiasis in China be adjusted by integrating the results of sentinel mice based surveys.},

After a strict selection according to our criteria, 82 articles were included in qualitative synthesis and ultimately 52 studies were included in quantitative synthesis. Three species of microsporidia were confirmed to exist in China, including Enterocytozoon bieneusi (E. bieneusi), Nosema and Encephalitozoon cuniculi (E. cuniculi). The highest overall estimated prevalence of E. bieneusi in humans was 8.1\%, which was observed in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients (AIDS). Moreover, the prevalence of E. bieneusi in animals including the cattle, dogs, pigs, deer, sheep and goats were analyszed in this study. The overall estimated prevalence of E. bieneusi acquired by using the random effects model in meta-analysis in cattle, dogs, pigs, sheep and goats and deer was 20.0\% (95\% confidence intervals: 0.133-0.266, I(2) = 98.031\%, p {\textless} 0.0001), 7.8\% (95\% CI: 0.050-0.106, I(2) = 60.822\%, p = 0.0537), 45.1\% (95\% CI: 0.227-0.674, I(2) = 98.183\%, p {\textless} 0.0001), 28.1\% (95\% CI: 0.146-0.415, I(2) = 98.716\%, p {\textless} 0.0001) and 19.3\% (95\% CI: 0.084-0.303, I(2) = 96.995\%, p {\textless} 0.0001) respectively. The overall detection rate of E. bieneusi in water acquired by using the random effects model in meta-analysis was 64.5\% (95\% CI: 0.433-0.857, I(2) = 98.486\%, p {\textless} 0.0001). Currently, 221 genotypes of E. bieneusi, 1 genotype of E. cuniculi and 6 Nosema were detected in China. The most prevalent genotype of E. bieneusi was genotype D, followed by BEB6 and EbpC.},

	abstract = {Acid-sensitive ion channels, such as amiloride-sensitive cation channel (ACCN), transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1), and T-cell death-associated gene 8 (TDAG8) are highly related to the expression of fear and are expressed in several regions of the brain. These molecules can detect acidosis and maintain brain homeostasis. An important role of pH homeostasis has been suggested in the physiology of panic disorder (PD), with acidosis as an interoceptive trigger for panic attacks. To examine the effect of acid-sensitive channels on PD symptoms, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of these chemosensors in rodents and humans. Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched the Web of Science, Medline/Pubmed, Scopus, Science Direct, and SciELO databases. The review included original research in PD patients and animal models of PD that investigated acid-sensitive channels and PD symptoms. Studies without a control group, studies involving patients with a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, and in vitro studies were excluded. Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. The majority of the studies showed an association between panic symptoms and acid-sensitive channels. PD patients appear to display polymorphisms in the ACCN gene and elevated levels of TDAG8 mRNA. The results showed a decrease in panic-like symptoms after acid channel blockade in animal models. Despite the relatively limited data on this topic in the literature, our review identified evidence linking acid-sensitive channels to PD in humans and preclinical models. Future research should explore possible underlying mechanisms of this association, attempt to replicate the existing findings in larger populations, and develop new therapeutic strategies based on these biological features.},

	abstract = {Increases in the activated state of microglia, the main neuroimmune cells, are widely reported in the brains of patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders. Microglia transform from the resting to the activated state by sensing their environment, aided by a variety of ion channels. To examine the effect of ion channels on microglial phenotypes, we conducted a systematic review of immunohistochemical analyses of these neuroimmune cells in animal models following administration of ion channel antagonists, compared to control conditions. A systematic search of the PubMed and Web of Science electronic databases using the PRISMA and WHO methodologies for systematic reviews yielded 15 original peer-reviewed studies. The majority (13 out of 15) of these studies reported a decrease in microglial activated state after ion signaling pharmacological blockade. The studies provide evidence that acute administration of ion channel antagonists leads to a reduction in microglial activation in rodent brains in the models for epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, inflammation, pain, ischemia, and brain and spinal cord injury. Future research should explore microglial-specific druggable targets for neurological and psychiatric disorders. The investigation of acute and chronic administration of ion channel antagonists in microglial phenotypes in primates and the development of microglia-like cells derived from human stem cells could be valuable sources in this direction.},

Under the random effects model effect size, heterogeneity and meta-regressions were determined. Supplementation generates a high concentration of selenium in kidney (2.51 ppm) and less amount in blood (0,151 ppm); muscle (0.189 ppm) and liver (0.564 ppm) have intermediate values. In addition, inorganic selenium resulted in higher concentrations in kidney (2.74 ppm) and blood (0.157 ppm), and the organic form allowed more selenium to be concentrated in liver (0.568 ppm) and muscle (0.237 ppm). However, the effect was not consistent among studies which was reflected by high values in the inconsistency test ({\textgreater}72\%). The tissue concentration of selenium is affected by the number of repetitions, animals per experimental unit, individuals sampled per experimental unit and by the supplemented selenium level. This work concludes that organic and inorganic sources of selenium promote tissue retention; however, the concentration of this mineral is significantly affected by the factors mentioned above.},

	abstract = {Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular zoonotic bacterium that causes Q fever. Ruminants, including cattle, are broadly known to be reservoirs for this bacterium. Since 2006, many research groups have evaluated the herd-level prevalence of C. burnetii in cattle by molecular techniques on composite milk samples. This study explored the global C. burnetii herd-level prevalence from studies done on bovine bulk-tank milk (BTM) samples using PCR-based analysis. Also, moderators were investigated to identify sources of heterogeneity. Databases (CAB Abstracts, Medline via Ovid, PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar) were searched for index articles on C. burnetii prevalence in BTM samples by PCR published between January-1973 and November-2018. Numerous studies (1054) were initially identified, from which seventeen original publications were included in the meta-analysis based on the pre-defined selection criteria. These studies comprised 4031 BTM samples from twelve countries. A random-effects model was used because of considerable heterogeneity (I (2) = 98\%) to estimate the herd-level prevalence of C. burnetii as 37.0\%(CI(95\%)25.2-49.5\%). The average herd size appeared to account for a high level of the heterogeneity. No other moderators (geographic location, gross national income or notification criteria for Q fever) seemed to be determinant. This systematic evaluation demonstrated a high molecular prevalence of C. burnetii in BTM samples both in European and non-European countries, evidencing a widespread herd-level circulation of this agent in bovine dairy farms around the world. Meta-regression showed herd size as the most relevant moderator with the odds of a BTM sample testing positive doubling with every unit increase.},

Rapid development of industry and agriculture, as well as climate change throughout the globe, has led to change or increase in occurrence of rodent-borne diseases. Considering the distribution of rodents throughout Iran, the aim of this review is to assess the risk of rodent-borne diseases in Iran. Methodology/Principal finding: We searched Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Scientific Information Database (SID), and Magiran databases up to September 2016 to obtain articles reporting occurrence of rodent-borne diseases in Iran and extract information from them. Out of 70 known rodent-borne diseases, 34 were reported in Iran: 17 (50\%) parasitic diseases, 13 (38\%) bacterial diseases, and 4 (12\%) viral diseases. Twenty-one out of 34 diseases were reported from both humans and rodents. Among the diseases reported in the rodents of Iran, plague, leishmaniasis, and hymenolepiasis were the most frequent. The most infected rodents were Rattus norvegicus (16 diseases), Mus musculus (14 diseases), Rattus rattus (13 diseases), Meriones persicus (7 diseases), Apodemus spp. (5 diseases), Tatera indica (4 diseases), Meriones libycus (3 diseases), Rhombomys opimus (3 diseases), Cricetulus migratorius (3 diseases), and Nesokia indica (2 diseases). Conclusions/Significance: The results of this review indicate the importance of rodent-borne diseases in Iran. Considering notable diversity of rodents and their extensive distribution throughout the country, it is crucial to pay more attention to their role in spreading infectious diseases for better control of the diseases.},

Here we reviewed 10,090 abstracts and extracted data from 71 studies reported in 58 relevant publications, to assess quantitatively whether phenotypic trait changes associated with climate change are adaptive in animals. A meta-analysis focussing on birds, the taxon best represented in our dataset, suggests that global warming has not systematically affected morphological traits, but has advanced phenological traits. We demonstrate that these advances are adaptive for some species, but imperfect as evidenced by the observed consistent selection for earlier timing. Application of a theoretical model indicates that the evolutionary load imposed by incomplete adaptive responses to ongoing climate change may already be threatening the persistence of species.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Obesity is a major risk factor for several diseases, including metabolic syndrome (MetS), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The use of natural products, such as astaxanthin (ASX), a potent antioxidant compound produced by the freshwater green microalga Haematococcus pluvialis, has gained particular interest to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, and to improve redox status, often associated with obesity. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to comprehensively examine the effects of ASX in animal models of diet induced obesity-associated diseases in order to inform the design of future human clinical studies for ASX use as supplement or nutraceutical. METHODS: Cinahl, Cochraine, MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for English-language manuscripts published between January 2000 and April 2020 using the following key words: astaxanthin, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, NAFLD and metabolic. RESULTS: Seventeen eligible articles, corresponding to 21 animal studies, were included in the final quantitative analysis. ASX, at different concentrations and administered for different length of time, induced a significant reduction in adipose tissue weight (P = 0.05) and systolic blood pressure (P {\textless} 0.0001) in control animals. In animal models of T2D, ASX significantly reduced serum glucose levels (P = 0.04); whereas it improved several disease biomarkers in the blood (e.g. cholesterol, triglycerides, ALT and AST, P {\textless} 0.10), and reduced liver (P = 0.0002) and body weight (P = 0.11), in animal models of NAFLD. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of ASX in the diet has positive effects on symptoms associated with obesity related diseases in animals, by having lipid-lowering, hypo-insulin and hypoglycaemic capacity, protecting organs from oxidative stress and mitigating the immune system, as suggested in this review.},

	abstract = {Altered activity of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), an enzyme of the endocannabinoid system, has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). It is speculated that increased brain FAAH expression is correlated with increased depressive symptoms. The aim of this scoping review was to establish the role of FAAH expression in animal models of depression to determine the translational potential of targeting FAAH in clinical studies. A literature search employing multiple databases was performed; all original articles that assessed FAAH expression in animal models of depression were considered. Of the 216 articles that were screened for eligibility, 24 articles met inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Three key findings emerged: (1) FAAH expression is significantly increased in depressive-like phenotypes; (2) genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition of FAAH effectively reduces depressive-like behavior, with a dose-dependent effect; and (3) differences in FAAH expression in depressive-like phenotypes were largely localized to animal prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. We conclude, based on the animal literature, that a positive relationship can be established between brain FAAH level and expression of depressive symptoms. In summary, we suggest that FAAH is a tractable target for developing novel pharmacotherapies for MDD.},

	abstract = {Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major worldwide public health challenge, for which gene therapy offers a potential therapeutic approach. To date, no systematic review or meta-analysis has been published in this area, so we examined all relevant published studies on rodents to elucidate the overall effects of gene therapy on bodyweight, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT), fasting blood glucose, and insulin in animals with type 1 DM. The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, ISI Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar were systematically searched for potentially relevant studies. Mean±standard deviation (SD) was pooled using a random-effects model. After the primary search, out of 528 studies identified, 16 studies were in concordance with predefined criteria and selected for the final assessment. Of these, 12 studies used viral manipulation, and 4 employed non-viral vectors for gene delivery. The meta-analysis showed gene therapy with a viral vector decreased mean IPGTT (-12.69 mmol/l, P{\textless}0.001), fasting blood glucose (-13.51 mmol/l, P{\textless}0.001), insulin (398.28 pmol/l, P{\textless}0.001), and bodyweight (24.22 g, P{\textless}0.001), whereas non-viral vectors reduced fasting glucose (-29.95 mmol/l, P{\textless}0.001) and elevated insulin (114.92 pmol/l, P{\textless}0.001). Gene therapy has favorable effects on alleviating type 1 DM related factors in diabetic rodents.},

In this context, all available studies published in databases include Science Direct, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science among 1995 to December 2017; were screened accordingly. Also, the carcinogenic risk was estimated by calculating hazard index (HI) using the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The result of conducted meta-analysis for 49 articles containing 7484 data indicated that the rank order of type of milk based on the concentration of aflatoxin M$_{\textrm{1}}$ was Ultra-high temperature processing (UHT) milk (82.57 ng/kg) {\textgreater} raw milk (60.37 ng/kg) {\textgreater} pasteurized milk (PAS) (45.81 ng/kg). The pooled concentration of aflatoxin M$_{\textrm{1}}$ in raw and UHT milk was higher than EC (European Committee, 50 ng/kg) standard limit. The rank order of countries based on the concentration of aflatoxin M$_{\textrm{1}}$ in raw milk was Syria {\textgreater} Turkey {\textgreater} Iran {\textgreater} Egypt {\textgreater} Lebanon {\textgreater} Palestine; pasteurized milk, Turkey {\textgreater} Iran {\textgreater} Lebanon; and UHT milk, Iran {\textgreater} Turkey {\textgreater} Saudi Arabia. The overall prevalence of aflatoxin M$_{\textrm{1}}$ in the raw milk of Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, Palestine, Egypt, and Syria was identified as 76\%, 12\%, 67\%, 85\%, 38\%, and 14\%; pasteurized milk, in the Iran, Lebanon, and Turkey was 77\%, 36\%, and 11\%; and finally UHT milk in Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey was 81\%, 82\%, and 62\%, respectively. HI in the adult's consumer's raw milk in the Iran, Turkey, Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, and Egypt were calculated as 0.26, 0.47, 0.52, 0.34, 0.23 and 0.18; However, the HI for adult consumers of pasteurized milk in the Iran, Turkey, and Lebanon were 0.28, 0.31 and 0.11. Also, the measured HI for adult consumers of UHT milk in the Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Iran was 0.20, 0.33 and 0.50, respectively. The obtained HI for consumers of raw milk in the children age group of the Iran, Turkey, Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, and Egypt were 1.03,2.20, 2.42, 1.59, 1.05, and 0.84. The calculated HI for consumers of pasteurized milk in the children age group of the pasteurized milk in of Iran, Turkey, and Lebanon were 1.30, 1.56, and 0.50. Finally, in term of UHT milk in Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Iran were 0.94, 1.44 and 2.35, respectively. Unlike Adults, children consumers in the several Middle East countries are at considerable cancer risk due to consumption of raw, pasteurized and UHT milk contain AFM$_{\textrm{1}}$(HI?{\textgreater}1).},

	abstract = {Human consumption of fish protein, including canned tuna fish, is increasing steadily worldwide. However, there are some concerns about the potential exposure to elevated concentrations of metals in canned tuna fish. Several studies have been conducted in Iran regarding the concentration of metals in seafood, including copper (Cu), selenium (Se), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), nickel (Ni), tin (Sn), and cadmium (Cd) in canned tuna fish. The main aim of this study was to gather data from existing papers and to perform a meta-analysis of the pooled concentrations of metals to evaluate their non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks in children and adults consumers. Search was conducted retrieving data from the international biomedical databases with highly public access and consultation, e.g., Web of Science, PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus, and national database (SID and Irandoc) between 1983 and November of 2017. Data from 23 articles and 1295 samples were assessed and extracted. The ranking order of metals based on mean concentrations (μg/g wet weight) were Fe (13.17) {\textgreater} Zn (9.31) {\textgreater} Se (2.23) {\textgreater} Al (1.8) {\textgreater} Cr (1.63) {\textgreater} Cu (1.52) {\textgreater} As (0.38) {\textgreater} Ni (0.33) {\textgreater} Pb (0.24) {\textgreater} Cd (0.14) {\textgreater} Hg (0.11) {\textgreater} Sn (0.1). Except for Cd and Se, concentrations of other metals in the canned tuna fish were lower than the limits recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and Iran National Standards Organization (INSO). The minimum and maximum target hazard quotient (THQ) for adults were 5.55E-5 for Al and 2.23E-08 for Cr. For children, they were 7.23E-05 for Al and 2.91E-08 for Cr. THQ, and total target hazard quotient (TTHQ) were ≤1.0 for adult and children consumers. The Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR) of As was 3.21E-5 in adults and 4.18E-5 in children. Adults and children that consume canned tuna fish in Iran are not at non-carcinogenic risk but have a carcinogenic risk due to As.},

Although the concentrations of histamine in tuna in Iran have been investigated in several studies, definitive conclusions are elusive. This study was undertaken as a systematic review and meta-analysis of the concentration and prevalence of histamine in Iranian canned tuna, and the related health risk was assessed. An extensive search of articles in the databases Scopus, PubMed, and Scientific Information Database resulted in 11 articles and a total of 693 samples for inclusion in this review. The minimum and maximum concentrations of histamine were determined as 8.59 ± 14.24 and 160.52 ± 87.59 mg kg(−1), respectively. The mean concentration was calculated as 77.86 mg kg(−1) (95\% confidence interval [CI], 47.51 to 108.21 mg kg(−1)), which was lower than the 200 mg kg(−1) recommended limit by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The mean prevalence of histamine was 9.19\% (95\%; CI, 6.88 to 11.5\%). The 95\% value of the target hazard quotient for adult consumers was calculated as 0.10. In all studies performed in Iran, the concentration of histamine in canned tuna was lower than FDA standard. Health risk assessment indicated low histamine risk (target hazard quotient {\textless} 1) for adults in Iran from consumption of canned tuna.},

	abstract = {The infective stage of Anisakidae nematodes responsible for allergic reactions in humans is found in a variety of edible fish and cephalopods. The identification of geographical regions that are high risk for infected seafood may help prevent allergic reactions in humans. Despite an abundance of published literature which has identified anisakid larvae in an array of edible seafood as well as scattered reports of human allergic anisakiasis, the relationship between the two has not been fully explored. Therefore, a systematic spatio-temporal study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Anisakis spp. in fish from January 2000 to August 2020 firstly to explore the relationship between fish infection and cases of allergic anisakiasis and secondly to use fish infection data to map potential allergic anisakiasis 'hot spots'. A systematic literature search for original English text articles was conducted through search engines, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar. Out of 3228 articles which describe anisakid infection in fish, 264 were used for data extraction. Of 904 articles describing allergic anisakiasis, 37 were used for data extraction. A qualitative summary of the extracted data was performed using equal interval method (ArcMap software) in order to compare the global distribution of Anisakis-infected fish. Of the 152-identified fish hosts, five families were most commonly infected with Anisakis spp. These included Lophiidae (86.9\%), Trichiuridae (77.05\%), Zeidae (70.9\%), Merlucciidae (67.8\%) and Gadidae (56.8\%). The hot spot areas for allergic anisakiasis were North and northeast of Atlantic Ocean, southwest of USA, west of Mexico, south of Chile, east of Argentina, Norway, UK and west of Iceland (confidence 99\%). The highest rate of allergic anisakiasis was in Portugal and Norway with the prevalence rate of 18.45-22.50\%. Allergologists should consider allergic anisakiasis as a public health issue particularly in high-risk countries where high prevalences in fish have been demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is one of the major zoonotic concerns of the world, as milk and meat from cattle are major products for human consumption. Bovine tuberculosis not only affects the health of cattle and poses an imminent zoonotic threat, but also causes significant economic loss in both developed and developing countries. This systematic review reports the prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) organisms in slaughtered cattle showing tuberculosis-like lesion (TBL) with available literature worldwide. Appropriate keywords were used to search various databases to collect articles pertaining to slaughterhouse studies. Bovine TB prevalence, based on the prevalence of MTBC organisms in slaughtered cattle showing TBL by culture, microscopy, PCR and spoligotyping, was assessed in each study using a random-effects model and standardized mean with 95\% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed by the I(2) statistic. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots. Out of 72 hits, 37 studies were selected based on title and abstract. Ten articles were excluded due to lack of desired data, and 27 studies were included in the final analysis. From the selected articles, it was found that 426 [95\% CI: 302-560] per 1,000 slaughtered cattle with TBL were positive for the presence of MTBC organisms. The sensitivity analysis showed that no individual study alone influenced the estimation of pooled prevalence. The prevalence of MTBC organisms in slaughtered cattle showing TBL by culture, microscopy, PCR and spoligotyping was 474[95\% CI: 342-610], 385 [95\% CI: 269-515], 218 [95\% CI: 132-338], 326 [95\% CI: 229-442], respectively, per 1,000 slaughtered cattle. Most of the slaughtered cattle were from the same locality as the slaughterhouse. The results obtained in this study suggest that abattoir monitoring can give an estimate of the prevalence of bTB in that locality. This study also emphasizes the need to test cattle and animal handlers who were in contact with bTB-positive cattle.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Organophosphorus (OP) insecticide self-poisoning is a global problem, killing tens of thousands of people every year. Oxidative stress has been proposed to play a pathological role in OP poisoning, but whether it plays a direct toxic role is currently unclear.Objectives: To determine whether there is consistent evidence of oxidative stress in patients with acute OP insecticide self-poisoning, and whether there are animal or human trial data that indicate that treatment of oxidative stress provides clinical benefit, which would suggest a direct toxic effect of oxidative stress.Methods: We conducted a systematic review using the PubMed, EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews, based upon the following search terms and keywords: "organophosphate poisoning", "oxidative stress" and "antioxidant". All articles relevant to the aims of the study were included. Articles related to chronic OP poisoning, to use of medicines without antioxidant benefits, or to subjects other than oxidative stress were excluded. The search returned 256 results of which 17 studies were considered relevant and grouped under the following categories: observational human studies (n = 11) and intervention studies in animals (n = 4) and humans (n = 2).Oxidative stress markers in human studies: Oxidative damage to lipids and proteins was reported in all eleven human studies. Eight of nine studies reported variable increases in a weak marker of lipid peroxidation, malondialdehyde. In two case-control studies, erythrocyte membrane malondialdehyde concentrations were 380\% and 160\% higher in cases than controls, while plasma malondialdehyde concentrations were ∼63\% higher in cases than controls in three case-control studies. In a prospective study, plasma malondialdehyde did not increase significantly from baseline in moderate or severely poisoned patients. Five case-control studies measured thiol residues as markers of protein oxidative damage and found variable changes after poisoning. No evidence of oxidative DNA damage was found in the one study that investigated it.Antioxidant intervention studies in animals: After treatment with an antioxidant, all four studies showed an improvement in either markers of oxidative damage or antioxidant activity. One mouse study with a relatively low risk of bias showed that administration of acetylcysteine 200 mg/kg reduced malondialdehyde by 35\% and increased survival by more than 60\%.Antioxidant intervention studies in humans: We found two small randomised controlled trials reporting the use of acetylcysteine as an adjunct to standard treatment in acute OP poisoning. The trials found that acetylcysteine reduced atropine requirements by 77\% and 55\%, but did not affect clinically relevant outcomes.Conclusions: Several studies showed evidence of OP insecticide-induced oxidative damage and antioxidant activity, suggesting that endogenous antioxidant defences are triggered in acute OP poisoning. However, the markers of lipid peroxidation used were weak, there was high inter-individual variability between studies in results and quality, and marked variation between the OP insecticides involved. Animal data provide some evidence that antioxidants alleviate adverse effects of acute poisoning, suggesting that oxidative stress may directly cause clinical harm. Acetylcysteine appeared beneficial in animal studies, but this could be mediated via increased synthesis of the endogenous detoxifying agent, glutathione, rather than through a direct antioxidant effect. The two human clinical studies were too small to provide any clear evidence to support the use of acetylcysteine in OP poisoning. Further research into the mechanisms of oxidative stress in acute OP poisoning, combined with large unambiguous clinical trials of antioxidants, are required before they can be used routinely in treatment.},

	abstract = {Exposure to malathion (an organophosphate pesticide widely used around the world) has been associated with alterations in blood glucose concentration in animal models. However, the results are inconsistent. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate whether malathion exposure can disturb the concentrations of blood glucose in exposed rats. We performed a literature search of online databases including PubMed, EBSCO, and Google Scholar and reviewed original articles that analyzed the relation between malathion exposure and glucose levels in animal models. The selection of articles was based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The database search identified thirty-five possible articles, but only eight fulfilled our inclusion criteria, and these studies were included in the meta-analysis. The effect of malathion on blood glucose concentration showed a non-monotonic dose-response curve. In addition, pooled analysis showed that blood glucose concentrations were 3.3-fold higher in exposed rats than in the control group (95\% CI, 2-5; Z = 3.9; p {\textless} 0.0001) in a random-effect model. This result suggested that alteration of glucose homeostasis is a possible mechanism of toxicity associated with exposure to malathion.},

	abstract = {Zoonotic animal tuberculosis (TB) is a One Health paradigm infectious disease, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex bacteria, that affects different host species with varying levels of management. In most developed countries, official surveillance and control strategies support the longitudinal reporting of herd and/or animal prevalence. However, for under resourced countries without surveillance plans, this information may be obtained from cross-sectional studies only. The objective of this meta-analysis was to perform a worldwide estimate of the overall prevalence of animal TB in different livestock species whose importance in production systems varies according to the region of the world. The ISI's Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched combining keywords and related database-specific subject terms to identify relevant cohort or cross-sectional work published in this topic. A total of 443 articles were retrieved, screened, and a final set of 182 references included. Potential sources of variation were investigated using subgroup analyses and meta-regression. Prevalence estimates in five mammalian host groups were stratified according to host species, host characteristics, anatomical localization of lesions, sample size, geographical location, and diagnostic tests. The multivariable meta-regression analysis accounted for a range between 0\% (farmed wild boar) and 68.71\% (camelids) of the overall observed heterogeneity, indicating that the pondered predictors partially explain the observed variability. Differences in the overall prevalence of TB across hosts were small, with most groups showing values around 10\%, except farmed wild boar (41\%). The sample size emerged as an important moderator, with small size studies leading to the overestimation of prevalence. TB prevalence rates were very heterogeneous across continents and depended on the host, with lower values (below 10\%) in Africa and Asia, while North America (33.6\%, cattle), Europe (51\%, goats), and South America (85.7\%, pigs) exhibited higher rates, possibly related to greater densities of specific host groups managed on more intensive production systems. Stratification by diagnostic tests evidenced heterogeneous prevalence rates depending on the host group, possibly reflecting differences in test performance across different hosts. Results from this study highlight different TB burden scenarios, pinpointing host groups and diagnostics that should be prioritized in surveillance systems in different regions, thus providing policy-relevant information to catalyse TB control in settings with lower installed capacity and better resource allocation at the human-animal-environment interface.},

	abstract = {Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) infection causes significantly economic losses to cattle industry worldwide, also including China. The epidemiological prevalence of infection associated with BVDV in dairy cattle has not been systematically assessed in China. Therefore, we undertook this study to evaluate prevalent of BVDV infection. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from papers on the BVDV incidence and prevalence in dairy cattle in China by searching China Science and Technology Journal Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Fang Database and PubMed for publication from March 2003 to March 2018. The 41 studies reporting the prevalence of BVDV in cattle in China were selected upon our inclusion criterion. The pooled BVDV prevalence in dairy cattle in China was estimated to 53.0\% (95\% CI 40.2-65.7) based on the data obtained from the 27,530 cows tested using serological or virological assay in the qualified papers published during the periods (χ² = 51,861.0, I(2) = 99.9\%). The highest BVDV positive rate in dairy flocks reached 90.0\% in Fujian province of China, followed by Shaanxi (88.9\%) and Shandong (83.3\%). The prevalence in the six administrative districts of China was validated to be highly variable (25.7\%-72.2\%) and reached 72.2\% in dairy cattle flocks of Northern China. Besides, the BVDV-RNA positive rate was estimated 27.1\% (95\% CI 17.3-37.0) based on 6 studies, comparatively, the pooled BVDV seroprevalence based on 35 studies was about 57.0\% (95\% CI 44.4-69.5) in China. This systematic review and meta-analysis firstly established an estimated prevalence of BVDV in dairy herds in China, indicating that the BVDV infection is escalating, though there is a bias in the number of studies between 2003-2009 and 2010-2018 timescales. This study may help understand the status of BVDV infection in dairy herds in China. Further extensive and comprehensive investigation is recommended, and effective intervention measures for preventing and controlling BVDV spread in dairy herds should be deployed, especially herds that have been exposed to BVDV.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Brucellosis remains one of the most common zoonotic diseases globally, with more than half million human cases reported annually. Brucellosis is an emerging and re-emerging disease in China since the 1990s. An infectious reservoir constituted by domestic animals with brucellosis, especially ovine and caprine herds, poses a significant threat to public health. The seroprevalence of brucellosis in sheep and goat flocks in a national context is unavailable so far. Therefore, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the overall status of brucellosis in sheep and goats in China in almost two decades. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of brucellosis in ovine and caprine flocks in China increased in 2000-2009 (1.00\%; 95\% CI, 0.70-1.30) to 2010-2018 (3.20\%; 95\% CI, 2.70-3.60). The seroprevalence of brucellosis in sheep and goat flocks was higher in Eastern China, with 7.00\% of positive rate, than that in any other region, especially Shandong province (18.70\%). Brucellosis is highly endemic in some local regions. The high prevalence of brucellosis in agricultural regions is suggestive of a shift of geographic distribution. The pooled prevalence of brucellosis is higher in goat flocks than in sheep flocks in China. CONCLUSIONS: The overall data in this meta-analysis demands comprehensive intervention measures and further surveillance to facilitate the control of brucellosis in livestock. Further studies aimed at evaluating the risk factors associated with spreads of brucellosis in domestic animals unaddressed so far, and sufficient epidemiological data is important to the exploration and understanding of the prevalent status of brucellosis throughout the country and to disease control.},

The Brucella reservoir associated with livestock brucellosis poses a significant threat to public health, and awareness of the seroprevalence and spatial distribution of livestock brucellosis is valuable for the prevention and control of diseases caused by Brucella, especially human brucellosis. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the seroprevalence of brucellosis in dairy cattle in China. We retrieved 88 studies related to the seroprevalence of brucellosis in dairy cattle in China in which samples were harvested between 2008 and 2018. The results of our systematic review and meta-analysis reveal that the overall seroprevalence of brucellosis in dairy cattle herds in China was 1.9\% during the selected period, rising from 1.6\% in 2008-2012 to 2.6\% in 2013-2018. In Northern China, where the traditional agropastoral areas with more developed animal breeding industry are located, the brucellosis seroprevalence was {\textgreater}10\%. In contrast, the seroprevalence of brucellosis in Southern China reached only 5.5\%. At the provincial level, the highest brucellosis seroprevalence in dairy cattle was estimated at {\textgreater}30\% in Jilin province, followed by Shanxi, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, and Guizhou, each with a prevalence of 10-20\%. Additionally, the seroprevalence of brucellosis in some local areas was {\textgreater}30\% or even {\textgreater}50\%, indicating that Brucella infection was highly endemic in dairy herds in China. Our data may facilitate the prevention and control of brucellosis in domestic animals in China.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Listeria monocytogenes as the main causative agent of human listeriosis is an intracellular bacterium that has the capability to infect a wide range of cell types. Human listeriosis is a sporadic foodborne disease, which is epidemiologically linked with consumption of contaminated food products. Listeriosis may range from mild and self-limiting diseases in healthy people to severe systemic infections in susceptible populations. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in food resources and human samples from Iran. METHODS: A systematic search was performed by using electronic databases from papers that were published by Iranian authors Since January of 2000 to the end of April 2017. Then, 47 publications which met our inclusion criteria were selected for data extraction and analysis by Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of L. monocytogenes in human origin was 10\% (95\% CI: 7-12\%) ranging from 0 to 28\%. The prevalence of L. monocytogenes in animals was estimated at 7\% (95\% CI: 4-10\%) ranging from 1 to 18\%. Moreover, the pooled prevalence of L. monocytogenes in Iranian food samples was estimated at 4\% (95\% CI: 3-5\%) ranging from 0 to 50\%. From those 12 studies which reported the distribution of L. monocytogenes serotypes, it was concluded that 4b, 1/2a, and 1/2b were the most prevalent serotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of L. monocytogenes and prevalent serotypes in Iran are comparable with other parts of the world. Although the overall prevalence of human cross-contamination origin was low, awareness about the source of contamination is very important because of the higher incidence of infections in susceptible groups.},

Study and assessment of personality is critical because of the profound implications certain traits have with respect to injury risk, the horse-human relationship, training processes, learning in horses, and management or breeding practices. The review summarizes the evidence for a genetic basis of personality, the evidence for modification of personality by environment and experience, the measures and tools used in assessing personality, and the traits comprising personality. The review also highlights key considerations for the researcher and areas warranting further study. A literature search was conducted using Google Scholar and Web of Science with the search terms equine and horse in combination with personality and temperament. One hundred thirteen articles were included in the review after exclusion of non-peer-reviewed articles, abstracts, theses, and dissertations. Differences in personality between breeds, estimates of heritability, and identification of specific genes and genetic markers relating to personality illustrate the genetic basis of personality. Further work in identifying specific genes and genetic markers of other personality traits would enable more targeted breeding programs. Experience with their dam, environmental factors such as housing conditions, and training or handling modify a horse's expression of personality. These factors also present potential confounding variables for the researcher. The effects of the in vivo environment on personality in horses remains unexplored as does the importance of timing over the lifespan for modification and the duration of these effects. Personality is assessed via direct observation and measurement of behavioral, endocrine, cardiac response, or temperature correlates during structured tests or routine management procedures, questionnaires, or a combination thereof. Careful consideration should be given to selection of the most appropriate assessment method given the aims of the study, resources available, and previous validation of the method or methods. Reactivity, gregariousness, reactivity to humans, sensory sensitivity, and locomotor activity are some of the most assessed traits, but no unifying structure of personality is consistently identified across studies. Researchers should give attention to addressing and acknowledging potential confounding variables and selecting an appropriate trait to assess with validated measures.},

A literature search of PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus was carried out in November 2019 from which nine studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Despite the significant heterogeneity in the composition of the scaffolds used in each study, it could be concluded that scaffolds containing bioactive glass improve bone regeneration in these models, both by osteogenic and angiogenic measures. Incorporation of additional elements into the glass network, using additives, and using biochemical factors generally had a beneficial effect. Comparing the different compositions of non-cellular bioactive glass containing scaffolds is however difficult due to the heterogeneity in bioactive glass compositions, fabrication methods and biochemical additives used.},

In healthy dogs, premedication before laryngeal examination provided better examination conditions and maintained overall adequate laryngeal motion in 83\% of the studies. No difference in laryngeal motion between induction drugs was found in 73\% of the studies but the effects in dogs with laryngeal paralysis remain largely unknown. Doxapram increased laryngeal motion in healthy dogs without serious side effects, but intubation was necessary for some dogs with laryngeal paralysis.

	abstract = {Parasites reside inside or outside their hosts and get host nutrition and blood. Here, we have emphasized economic losses in cattle caused by parasitic diseases due to ecto- and endo- parasites (flies, ticks, mites and helminths). We have outlined different methods/models including economic evaluation techniques and dynamic analysis as a major class, used for the calculation of economic losses caused by parasites in cattle. According to already conducted studies, a decrease in production is mentioned in quantity and percentage while financial losses are expressed in the form of account with respect to per head, herd or for the specific study area. The parasites cause the reduced production and financial losses due to control, treatment and mortality costs. We calculated the average decrease in milk production and organ condemnation as 1.16 L animal-1 day-1 and 12.95\%, respectively, from overall cattle parasitic infections. Moreover, the average calculated financial and percentage losses were US\$ 50.67 animal-1 year-1 and 17.94\%, respectively. Economically important parasitic diseases mentioned here are caused by specific spp. of protozoans and helminths according to data collected from the literature. Protozoan diseases include tick-borne diseases, coccidiosis, neosporosis, trypanosomiasis and cryptosporidiosis. Losses due to tick-borne infections were encountered for decreased milk production, mortality, treatment and control. Losses from coccidiosis were due to decreased weight gain, treatment costs and mortality. While abortion losses were encountered in neosporosis. Trypanosomiasis caused losses due to a decrease in milk yield. Moreover, only diagnostic (conventional or molecular techniques) cost was taken into account for cryptosporidiosis. Economically important nematode parasites are Oesophagostomum spp., Cooperia spp., Trichostrongylus spp., Strongyloides spp., Ostertagia spp. and Haemonchus placei. Due to the zoonotic importance of echinococcosis, Echinococcus granulosus is the most economically important cestode parasite. Losses caused by echinococcosis were due to organ condemnation, carcass weight loss and decreases hide value, milk production and fecundity. While, fascioliasis is one of the most economically important trematodal disease, which causes cirrhosis of the liver due to parasite migration, and thus, the organ becomes inedible. So, it would be helpful for farmers and researchers to approach these methods/models for calculation of parasitic losses and should adopt suitable measures to avoid long-term economic losses.},

We aimed to systematically review published transmission dynamic modelling studies of rabies in both humans and dogs with a focus on studies which estimated the epidemiological and economic impact of different preventive measures. The findings are intended to inform the World Health Organization's (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) to improve programmatic feasibility and clinical practice in rabies. Medline and Scopus were systematically searched for peer-reviewed articles which were published up to 14(th) June 2017. In addition, studies identified from a meeting of the WHO Expert Consultation on Rabies on 26-28(th) April 2017 in Bangkok, Thailand were added, resulting in 19 articles which were included in the review. Results from the disease modelling indicated that the basic reproduction number was low (less than 2 in all but one study). All studies found that rabies control through canine vaccination was likely to be effective in terms of reducing the incidence of rabies in dogs and/or humans, with most studies suggesting 70\% annual coverage was adequate. Vaccine coverage, dog density and birth rate were identified as crucial factors influencing the effectiveness of the interventions. In conclusion, the findings from this review suggest that rabies control through canine vaccination is likely to be effective in reducing the incidence of rabies. Vaccine coverage, dog density and canine birth rate were identified as critical factors influencing the effectiveness of vaccination interventions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Amantadine blocks N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and has dopaminergic and noradrenergic action, a neurochemical profile that suggests its potential as an antidepressant drug. We conducted a systematic review of preclinical and clinical studies addressing the effects of amantadine in animal models of depression and in patients with depression. METHODS: PubMed, Science Direct, and Web of Science were searched up to September 1, 2017 to identify clinical and preclinical studies. The following search terms were used: "amantadine AND depress*"; "amantadine AND mood"; "amantadine AND animal models AND antidepres*"; and "amantadine AND (forced swim, learned helplessness, reserpine, chronic mild stress, anhedonia, sucrose preference)." RESULTS: Amantadine had antidepressant-like effects in animal models and appeared to potentiate the antidepressant effects of other antidepressants. These preclinical findings have received some support from the results of small open-label clinical trials, suggesting that amantadine can reduce depressive symptomatology and potentiate the antidepressant effects of monoaminergic drugs. In addition to its glutamatergic and dopaminergic effects, the potential antidepressant-like effects of amantadine have been linked to molecular and cellular actions, such as increased expression of neurotrophic factors (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor), activation of σ1 receptors, decreased corticosterone levels, and decreased inflammatory response to stress. CONCLUSION: Amantadine is an interesting candidate as new antidepressant drug for the treatment of depression.},

	abstract = {Streptococcus suis (S. suis) is a gram-positive bacterial pathogen in pigs which can cause serious infections in human including meningitis, and septicaemia resulting in serious complications. There were discrepancies between different data and little is known concerning associated risk factors of S. suis. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate on S. suis infection risk factors in human. We searched eight relevant databases using the MeSH terms "Streptococcus suis" OR "Streptococcus suis AND infection" limited in human with no time nor language restriction. Out of 4,999 articles identified, 32 and 3 studies were included for systematic review and meta-analysis respectively with a total of 1,454 Streptococcus suis cases reported. S. suis patients were generally adult males and the elderly. The mean age ranged between 37 to 63 years. Meningitis was the most common clinical manifestation, and deafness was the most common sequelae found among survivors followed by vestibular dysfunction. Infective endocarditis was also noted as among the most common clinical presentations associated with high mortality rate in a few studies. Meta-analyses categorized by type of control groups (community control, and non-S. suis sepsis) were done among 850 participants in 3 studies. The combined odd ratios for studies using community control groups and non-S. Suis sepsis as controls respectively were 4.63 (95\% CI 2.94-7.29) and 78.00 (95\% CI 10.38-585.87) for raw pork consumption, 4.01 (95\% CI 2.61-6.15) and 3.03 (95\% CI 1.61-5.68) for exposure to pigs or pork, 11.47, (95\% CI 5.68-23.14) and 3.07 (95\% CI 1.81-5.18) for pig-related occupation and 3.56 (95\% CI 2.18-5.80) and 5.84 (95\% CI 2.76-12.36) for male sex. The results were found to be significantly associated with S. suis infection and there was non-significant heterogeneity. History of skin injury and underlying diseases were noted only a small percentage in most studies. Setting up an effective screening protocol and public health interventions would be effective to enhance understanding about the disease.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: While reports of critical thinking exist in the health professions literature, development of critical thinking across a broad range of health-professions students has not been systematically reviewed. METHODS: In this meta-analysis, multiple databases and journals were searched through February 2016 to identify longitudinal studies using standardized tests of critical thinking [California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST), Health Science Reasoning Test (HSRT), and Defining Issues Test (DIT)] in any language. Two reviewers extracted information and collected information regarding primary author, publishing journal, health profession, critical thinking test, and time1/time2 means and standard deviations. Standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were reported using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Four hundred sixty-two studies were screened, and 79 studies (representing 6884 students) were included. Studies contained 37 CCTST, 22 DIT, and 20 HSRT. Health professions comprised nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, dentistry, medicine, veterinary medicine, dental hygiene, clinical laboratory sciences, and allied health. Cohen's kappa was strong (0.82) for inter-reviewer agreement. Both the CCTST (SMD = 0.37, 95\% CI = 0.23-0.52) and DIT (SMD = 0.28, 95\%CI = 0.18-0.39) demonstrated significant increases in total scores, but the HSRT (SMD = 0.03, 95\%CI = -0.05-0.12) did not show improvement. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis, students from the majority of health professions consistently showed improvement in development of critical thinking.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence published on the treatment of idiopathic chylothorax (IC) in small animals. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review. SAMPLE POPULATION: Dogs and cats with IC. METHODS: A literature search was performed in three bibliographic databases in July 2018 for publications on IC in dogs and cats. Articles meeting criteria for inclusion were evaluated for treatment, survival, outcome data, and level of evidence (LoE) with a modified Oxford Level of Evidence (mOLE) and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) system. RESULTS: Eleven of 313 identified articles met the inclusion criteria. Only one study was identified in dogs as having higher LoE by using the mOLE system, whereas no study was identified as such in either species with the GRADE system. Surgery was the primary treatment in all dogs and in 93\% (68/73) of cats. Medical therapy was the primary treatment in 7\% (5/73) of cats. The most common surgical treatment combined thoracic duct ligation (TDL) and subtotal pericardiectomy (SP; 40\%; 34/84) in dogs and TDL in cats (51\% [37/73]). CONCLUSION: The body of literature for IC treatment in small animals was limited to one higher LoE study in dogs and none in cats. No strong conclusion could be drawn regarding the effectiveness of any one surgical method in dogs or cats, and no evidence was found to support medical therapy as a primary treatment. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The best available evidence regarding the treatment of IC is published in dogs and provides some support for surgical treatment with either TDL + cisterna chyli ablation or TDL + SP. Additional evidence is required to confirm this finding.},

	abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a widespread disease that crosses the human and animal health boundaries, with infection being reported in wildlife, from temperate and subtropical to arctic regions. Often, TB in wild species is closely associated with disease occurrence in livestock but the TB burden in wildlife remains poorly quantified on a global level. Through meta-regression and systematic review, this study aimed to summarize global information on TB prevalence in commonly infected wildlife species and to draw a global picture of the scientific knowledge accumulated in wildlife TB. For these purposes, a literature search was conducted through the Web of Science and Google Scholar. The 223 articles retrieved, concerning a 39-year period, were submitted to bibliometric analysis and 54 publications regarding three wildlife hosts fulfilled the criteria for meta-regression. Using a random-effects model, the worldwide pooled TB prevalence in wild boar is higher than for any other species and estimated as 21.98\%, peaking in Spain (31.68\%), Italy (23.84\%) and Hungary (18.12\%). The pooled prevalence of TB in red deer is estimated at 13.71\%, with Austria (31.58\%), Portugal (27.75\%), New Zealand (19.26\%) and Spain (12.08\%) positioning on the top, while for European badger it was computed 11.75\%, peaking in the UK (16.43\%) and Ireland (22.87\%). Despite these hard numbers, a declining trend in wildlife TB prevalence is apparent over the last decades. The overall heterogeneity calculated by multivariable regression ranged from 28.61\% (wild boar) to 60.92\% (red deer), indicating that other unexplored moderators could explain disease burden. The systematic review shows that the most prolific countries contributing to knowledge related with wildlife TB are settled in Europe and Mycobacterium bovis is the most reported pathogen (89.5\%). This study provides insight into the global epidemiology of wildlife TB, ascertaining research gaps that need to be explored and informing how should surveillance be refined.},

	abstract = {Animal tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) bacteria remains as one of the most significant infectious diseases of livestock, despite decades of eradication programmes and research efforts, in an era where the livestock sector is among the most important and rapidly expanding commercial agricultural segments worldwide. This work provides a global overview of the spatial and temporal trends of reported scientific knowledge of TB in livestock, aiming to gain insights into research subtopics within the animal TB epidemiology domain and to highlight territorial inequalities regarding data reporting and research outputs over the years. To deliver such information, peer-reviewed reports of TB studies in livestock were retrieved from the Web of Science and Google Scholar, systematized and dissected. The validated data set contained 443 occurrence observations, covering the 1981-2020 period (39 years). We highlight a clear move towards transdisciplinary areas and the One Health approach, with a global temporal increase in publications combining livestock with wildlife and/or human components, which reflect the importance of non-prototypical hosts as key to understanding animal TB. It becomes evident that cattle is the main host across works from all continents; however, many regions remain poorly surveyed. TB research in livestock in low-/middle-income countries is markedly growing, reflecting changes in animal husbandry, but also mirroring the globalization era, with a marked increase in international collaboration and capacitation programmes for scientific and technological development. This review gives an overview of the most prolific continents, countries and research fields in animal TB epidemiology, clearly outlining knowledge gaps and key priority topics. The estimated growth trend of livestock production until 2050, particularly in Asia and Africa, in response to human population growth and animal-protein demand, will require further investment in early surveillance and adaptive research to accommodate the higher diversity of livestock species and MTC members and raising the possibility to fine-tune funding schemes.},

These studies, however, have yet to be comprehensively reviewed. Accordingly, this systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the extant literature examining the effect of minocycline on depressive-like behavior in rodent models. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for articles that met prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria, and standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated for each continuous measure of depressive-like behavior. The overall effect of minocycline on depressive-like behavior was estimated using robust variance estimation meta-analysis. Separate subgroup analyses were conducted on diseased vs healthy animal models, different rodent species, and immobility-based vs anhedonia-based measures of depressive-like behavior. A total of 22 preclinical studies (816 animals) were included. Overall, minocycline reduced depressive-like behavior in rodents (SMD = -1.07, 95\% CI -1.41--0.74, p {\textless} 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that minocycline reduced depressive-like behavior in diseased, but not healthy, animal models. Finally, minocycline was found to reduce both immobility-based and anhedonia-based outcomes. These findings suggest that minocycline may be an effective treatment of core depressive symptoms, and that further investigation of minocycline treatment for clinically relevant depression in humans is warranted.},

Plant and animal products have traditionally been used to relieve pain for centuries. However, no attempt has been made to compile a single report of plant and animal products possessing analgesic properties. This review enadeavours to recover data from published articles to establish a collective literature review on folk remedies from plant and animal sources used as analgesics and in the treatment of pain-related conditions, identifying gaps in existing knowledge and future works. Relevant information was systematically retrieved using the PRISMA method. In this review, in total, 209 plants were found to be either used raw or prepared by decoctions or maceration. Administration was either oral or topical, and they were predominantly used in Asian countries. In vivo studies of plants with analgesic properties, which were tested using different methods including acetic-induced writhing test, hotplate test, tail-flick test, and formalin-induced pain test, were compiled. Animal products with analgesic properties were obtained mainly from compounds present in venom; their bioactive compounds were also identified. In the literature search, certain gaps were noted, which could be reviewed in future studies. For instance, there was a disparity of information regarding the traditional uses of medicinal plants. In this review, an attempt was made to critically assess and describe the pharmacological properties and bioactive composition of indigenous plants, some animal species, and animal venom by scrutinizing databases and looking for published articles. Therefore, it can be concluded that the compounds obtained from these sources can serve as important ingredients in therapeutic agents to alleviate pain once their limitations are assessed and improved upon. In the literature search, certain gaps were noted, which could be reviewed in future studies.},

Currently there is no any accepted vaccine for prevention of T. gondii infection. Many studies are focused on using of various excretory secretory antigens (ESA); and among them dense granule antigens (GRAs) being involved in parasite survival, virulence and replication processes, are considered as one of the predominant vaccine candidates. The aim of this systematic review is to prepare more comprehensive understanding of these antigens to reduce T. gondii infection in humans and animals. English databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Scopus, ISI Web of Science were systematically searched and papers evaluating GRA antigens published until June 2019 were selected. Evaluation of selected publications revealed that GRA4 and GRA7 substantially increased survival time of the experimental animals. It is noticeable that the maximum reduction in cyst burden was observed in BALB/c mice vaccinated with combination of GRA3, GRA7 and M2AP antigens (93.5\%). GRA6 and GRA10 have shown high immunogenicity and GRA1 and 2 are important for virulence and induction of immune responses. This review will be helpful for researchers to conduct more effective studies in the field of immunization against T. gondii infection.},

SETTING: Sina Trauma and Surgery Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. METHODS: We searched PubMed and EMBASE via Ovid SP with no temporal and linguistic restrictions. Besides, hand-search was performed in the bibliographies of relevant studies. The experimental non-interventional and non-transgenic animal studies confined to the rat species which assess the pathological change of microglia /macrophages at the specified time were included. RESULTS: We found 15,315 non-duplicate studies. Screening through title and abstract narrowed down to 607 relevant articles, 31 of them were selected based on the inclusion criteria. The reactivity of the microglia/macrophages initiates in early hours PI in contusion, compression and transection models. Cells activity reached a maximum within 48 h to 28 days in compression, 7 days in contusion and between 4 and 60 days in transection models. Inflammatory response occurred at the epicenter, in or near the lesion site in both gray and white matter in all three injury models with a maximum extension of one centimeter caudal and rostral to the epicenter in the gray matter in contusion and transection models. CONCLUSION: This study was designed to study spatial-temporal changes in the activation of microglia/macrophages overtime after TSCI. We were able to demonstrate time-dependent cell morphological changes after TSCI. The peak times of cell reactivity and the areas where the cells responded to the injury were determined.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Regular walking is a critical target of physical activity (PA) promotion, and dog walking is a feasible PA intervention for a large segment of the population. The purpose of this paper was to review PA interventions that have involved canine interactions and to evaluate their effectiveness. A secondary aim of this review was to highlight the populations, settings, designs and intervention components that have been applied so as to inform future research. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: We carried out literature searches to August 2019 using six common databases. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies included published papers in peer-reviewed journals and grey literature (theses and dissertations) in the English language that included any PA behaviour change design (ie, randomised controlled trial, quasi-experimental) that focused on canine-related intervention. We grouped findings by population, setting, medium, research design and quality, theory and behaviour change techniques applied. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 25 010 publications which were reduced to 13 independent studies of medium and high risks of bias after screening for eligibility criteria. The approaches to intervene on PA were varied and included loaner dogs, new dog owners and the promotion of walking among established dog owners. Findings were consistent in showing that canine-assisted interventions do increase PA (82\% of the studies had changes favouring the canine-facilitated intervention). Exploratory subanalyses showed that specific study characteristics and methods may have moderated the effects. Compared with studies with longer follow-up periods, studies with shorter follow-up favoured behaviour changes of the canine intervention over the control condition. CONCLUSION: Canine-based PA interventions appear effective, but future research should move beyond feasibility and proof of concept studies to increase rigour, quality and generalisability of findings.},

	abstract = {Achieving high embryo quality following IVF and ICSI procedures is a key factor in increasing fertility outcomes in human infertile couples. While the male factor is known to underlie infertility in about 50\% of cases, studies performed in human infertile couples have not been able to define the precise effect of sperm affectations upon embryo development. This lack of consistency is, in most cases, due to the heterogeneity of the results caused by the multiple male and female factors that mask the concrete effect of a given sperm parameter. These biases can be reduced with the use of animal gametes, being a good approach for basic researchers to design more homogeneous studies analyzing the specific consequences of a certain affectation. Herein, we conducted a systematic review (March 2020) that assessed the relationship between sperm oxidative stress alterations and IVF/ICSI outcomes in nonhumans mammals. The review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines and using the MEDLINE-PubMed and EMBASE databases. Thirty articles were included: 11 performed IVF, 17 conducted ICSI, and two carried out both fertilization methods. Most articles were conducted in mouse (43\%), cattle (30\%) and pig models (10\%). After IVF treatments, 80\% of studies observed a negative effect of sperm oxidative stress on fertilization rates, and 100\% of studies observed a negative effect on blastocyst rates. After ICSI treatments, a positive relationship of sperm oxidative stress with fertilization rates (75\% of studies) and with blastocyst rates (83\% of studies) was found. In conclusion, the present systematic review shows that sperm oxidative stress is associated with a significant reduction in fertilization rates and in vitro embryo development.},

	abstract = {Collaborative approaches in health, such as One Health (OH), are promising; nevertheless, several authors point at persistent challenges for designing and implementing OH initiatives. Among other challenges, OH practitioners struggle in their efforts to collaborate across disciplines and domains. This paper aims to provide insights into the existing challenges for designing and implementing OH initiatives, their causes and solutions, and points out strategic solutions with the potential to solve practical challenges. A systematic literature search was performed for emerging challenges and proposed solutions in the process of conducting OH initiatives. Next, a thematic and a causal analysis were performed to unravel challenges and their causes. Finally, solutions were discriminated on whether they were only recommended, or implemented as a proof-of-principle. The 56 included papers describe 21 challenges endured by OH initiatives that relate to different themes (policy and funding; education and training; surveillance; multi-actor, multi-domain, and multi-level collaborations; and evidence). These challenges occur in three different phases: the acquisition of sufficient conditions to start an initiative, its execution, and its monitoring and evaluation. The findings indicate that individual challenges share overlapping causes and crosscutting causal relations. Accordingly, solutions for the successful performance of OH initiatives should be implemented to tackle simultaneously different types of challenges occurring in different phases. Still, promoting collaboration between the wide diversity of stakeholders, as a fundamental aspect in the OH approach, is still by far the most challenging factor in performing OH initiatives. Causes for that are the difficulties in promoting meaningful and equal participation from diverse actors. Solutions proposed for this challenge focused on guiding stakeholders to think and collaborate beyond their professional and cultural silos to generate knowledge co-creation and innovative methodologies and frameworks. Finally, the biggest knowledge gap identified, in terms of proposed solutions, was for monitoring and evaluating OH initiatives. This highlights the need for future research on evaluation methods and tools specific for the OH approach, to provide credible evidence on its added value. When considering challenges endured by former OH initiatives and the proposed solutions for these challenges, practitioners should be able to plan and structure such initiatives in a more successful way, through the strategic pre-consideration of solutions or simply by avoiding known barriers.},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives: Rickettsia rickettsii is a pathogen that is known to cause spotted fever, a zoonosis that is endemic in several regions of the Americas. However, no systematic review and meta-analysis has been conducted to estimate the prevalence of this rickettsial disease in the Americas. Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of R. rickettsii in ticks in the Americas. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed and data were retrieved from four electronic databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, SciELO, ScienceDirect, and Directory of Open Access Journals. The pooled prevalence and heterogeneity were determined using a random-effects model and using Cochran's Q test and I(2) index, respectively. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot and Egger's method. Results: The pooled prevalence of R. rickettsii in ticks was highest in Colombia (17.00\%; confidence interval [95\% CI]: 7.01-30.24), followed by Mexico (9.89\%; 95\% CI: 2.03-22.74), Panama (2.76\%; 95\% CI: 0.45-6.93), Brazil (2.03\%; 95\% CI: 0.66-4.14), and the United States (0.50\%; 95\% CI: 0.15-1.05). The tick species most frequently infected by R. rickettsii were Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (6.23\%; 95\% CI: 2.79-10.92) and Amblyomma mixtum (4.36\%; 95\% CI: 0.25-13.14). Interpretation and Conclusion: It can be suggested that studies aiming to identify the potential vectors of R. rickettsii should be conducted more intensively to better understand the epidemiology of spotted fever in the Americas.},

Three electronic databases (PubMed, LILACS, and SciELO) were searched to establish MRSA prevalence from 51 studies published from 2003 through May 2017. The heterogeneity was assessed, and the pooled MRSA prevalence was calculated by using the random effects model according to the method of DerSimonian and Laird. Pooled MRSA prevalence (95\% confidence interval [CI]) in turkeys, turkey meat, broilers, and chicken meat was 36\% (1 to 78\%), 13\% (1 to 28\%), 5\% (2 to 9\%), and 5\% (3 to 8\%), respectively. South America had the highest MRSA prevalence (27\%; 95\% CI, 17 to 37\%), and North America had the lowest (1\%; 95\% CI, 0 to 2\%). Livestock-associated MRSA has been isolated from poultry and poultry meat, indicating that this variant can spread from farm to fork. The presence of MRSA in poultry and poultry meat poses risks to public health, and steps should be taken to mitigate the contamination and spread of this bacterium along the poultry production chain.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jep.2020.112547},
	abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The Brazilian Cerrado is a biome with a remarkable diversity of plant species, many of which are used mainly by local communities as a source of treatment to several pathologic processes, especially for the treatment of wounds. However, no systematic review exists focusing on the plants used in this respect and on the appropriate pharmacological investigations that substantiate the actions that are reported. This study revisits the traditional use of medicinal plants from the Brazilian Cerrado in the treatment of wounds and the pharmacological characteristics of the reported plant species. METHOD: ology: For the present article, previous studies on plants of the Brazilian Cerrado used for wound healing carried out between 1996 and 2018 were researched on various academic databases (PubMed, Elsevier, Springer, Lilacs, Google Escolar, and Scielo). RESULTS: A total of 33 studies were carried out on 29 plant species distributed into 18 families, mainly Fabaceae or Leguminosae (9), Bignoniaceae (2), Asteraceae (2), Euphorbiaceae (2). Considering the great diversity of Cerrado plants, only a small number of wound healing studies were carried out between 1996 and 2018. It was observed that there is a large gap between experimentation assay and traditional use. There are only few connections between the form of use by the population and the experiments conducted in the laboratory. We found that only about 12\% of these studies considered to use the methodologies, or at least in parts, to obtain extracts such as those used in folk medicine. Approximately 37\% of the experiments were performed using the bark as well as the same ratio for leaves, 6\% using the fruits, and 9\% using the seeds, roots or flowers. In several studies, there are reports of chemical constituents such as flavonoids and tannins, followed by steroid terpenes, saponins, and fatty acids, and alkaloids. However, approximately 35\% of the studies did not supply information about compounds present in the preparation or the effect which could be attributed to these agents in respect to wound healing. Regarding treatment, most of the studies employed a topical treatment, though intraperitoneal and oral treatment were also described using either topical, oil-based formulations, but also gel- or saline-based formulations. CONCLUSIONS: Although, there has been an increase in knowledge about the biological actions of plants from Cerrado biome, the scientific basis for the traditional use of these local medicinal plants in wound healing does not provide sufficient information on the efficacy of the treatment, the molecular mechanisms, or, in particular, the effective doses used and the drug interactions. Thus, focused research investigating these hypotheses from traditional knowledge is necessary to prove the evidence of the potential pharmacological action.},

	abstract = {Leptospirosis is one of the most widespread zoonotic diseases, with more than one million human cases reported worldwide every year. Dogs could develop infections that range from asymptomatic to severe, and shed leptospires with their urine. Given their close contact with humans, dogs may act both as epidemiological links or as sentinels of pathogenic leptospires in the environment. The aims of our study were to quantitatively summarize the overall prevalence of leptospiral antibodies and to identify factors associated with the probabilities of infection. We searched the electronic databases Scopus, PubMed, PMC and ScienceDirect for observational studies on canine leptospirosis published between 1989 and December 2019 and written in English, Spanish or Portuguese. We fitted a series of multilevel random effects meta-analysis models to estimate the prevalence of antibodies against Leptospira for different types of dogs, health statuses, diagnostic tests, geographic regions and income categories of the countries. We also fitted a number of random effects meta-analysis models to estimate the pooled odds-ratio of factors associated with canine leptospirosis. After removing duplicates and articles not meeting selection criteria, a total of 130 studies in 91 articles were included in this work. We found lower seroprevalence estimates in North America countries (P{\textless}0.001) and other high income countries (P{\textless}0.001). We also found higher probabilities of leptospiral infection in adult (P=0.017), male dogs with access to the streets (P{\textless}0.001). Identifying the profile of dogs that are more exposed to leptospirosis could be useful in the design of public health strategies for the prevention and control of leptospirosis.},

DATA SOURCES: PubMed database search (1966 to November 2017) using the search terms allergy, allergic rhinitis, asthma, allergic asthma, house dust mite, allergen immunotherapy, subcutaneous immunotherapy, sublingual immunotherapy, MK-8237, children, and pediatric. Package labeling and references from identified articles were also reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies published in English evaluating the efficacy of HDM SLIT in children {\textless}18 years of age were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Patients with allergic asthma who fail to improve with pharmacotherapy may require disease-modifying, HDM-specific immunotherapy. Acceptance of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) in the pediatric population is limited by the need for weekly injections and the risk of systemic adverse effects. Trials in pediatric patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma monosensitized to HDM demonstrated mixed results, likely because of variability in methodologies. SLIT reduced asthma symptoms in 8 placebo-controlled studies; however, asthma medication use was reduced in just 4 trials. Compared with pharmacotherapy alone, SLIT and SCIT decreased asthma symptom scores similarly for up to 3 years. Sequential SCIT/SLIT decreased both asthma symptoms and medication scores and was more effective than SLIT alone. CONCLUSIONS: Sublingual HDM immunotherapy reduces symptom scores in pediatric patients with allergic asthma but may be slower in onset and less effective than SCIT in reducing asthma medication use.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reports of natural infections of Schistosoma mansoni in a number of species of nonhuman primates (NHPs) in Africa, coupled with the substantial overlap of NHP habitats and human schistosomiasis endemic areas, has led to concerns about the role of NHPs in the transmission of human schistosomiasis. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to describe the current scope of knowledge for Africa, for the NHP species implicated, their geographical distribution, infection rates with S. mansoni, and to discuss the implications for public health and conservation. MAIN TEXT: A systematic search of the literature was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, the World Health Organization (WHO) library database, World Cat, and ScienceDirect without any language restriction. Studies examining S. mansoni infection of any African NHP species were included. Study types, primate species, their geographical distribution, and parasite diagnostic techniques reported in the studies were qualitatively summarized. Data for species with sample sizes ≥10 were included in the meta-analysis. We assessed the reported infection rate, and used a random-effects model to estimate the summary infection rates and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity among studies using the I(2) statistics. Twenty-nine publications, from 1960 to 2018, were identified and included in the review. The studies examined a total of 2962 primates belonging to 22 species in 11 genera across ten countries (Cameroon, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe), and S. mansoni infections were found in nine species of five genera in all countries. When we excluded studies with sample sizes {\textless} 10, data from 24 studies on 11 species of primates in three genera in ten countries remained in the meta-analysis. The overall pooled estimate of infection rate was 10\% (95\% CI: 6-16\%) with high heterogeneity (I(2) = 94.77\%) across countries and species/genera. Among the three genera, Pan had the highest infection rate of 15\% (95\% CI: 0-55\%), followed by Papio at 11\% (95\% CI: 6-18\%), and Cercopithecus at 5\% (95\% CI: 0-14\%). The association between NHP and human infections was positive, but not significant, due to low study sample matches and high variation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that S. mansoni infection rate is high in African NHPs, with substantial heterogeneities across species/genera and countries in Africa. Given the evidence for potential spillover and spillback of S. mansoni between African NHPs and humans, further research is urgently needed to understand ecology and mechanisms of transmission of the parasite between NHP and human hosts, in order to inform control strategies of this important neglected tropical disease.},

	abstract = {Stereotypies are repetitive behaviors the may be performed in effort to relieve frustration or cope with a sub-optimal environment. Cattle are hypothesized to cope with the differences between forage and grain-based diets with oral stereotypies that manifest as in the form of non-nutritive oral behaviors (NNOB). Diets fed in confinement contain less roughage compared to the predominantly forage diets cattle consume while on pasture. These changes in diet composition, presentation, and time required to consume elicit physiological changes in the rumen and require cattle to spend less time engaged in oral behaviors (e.g. mastication of the cud, using the tongue to grasp and pull on grass) - all factors that contribute to NNOB performance. Allogrooming and self-grooming are also classified as NNOBs, however, they have function and are not stereotypic in nature. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the current state of research regarding the relationship between diet and NNOB performance in cattle. Searches of CAB Abstracts, AGRIS, Scopus and SPAC, performed prior to September 2018 resulted in 22 articles (25 studies) that analyzed the impact of dietary treatments on NNOB performance in both beef and dairy cattle housed in confinement. Increasing dietary roughage levels decreased the performance of NNOBs while limiting dietary roughage increased NNOB performance. However, there was little conclusive evidence to suggest that ingredient type, particle size, total feed amount, mode of feeding, or mineral addition influenced NNOB performance. Strengths of the studies included consistent housing across treatments and valid and reliable methods of behavioral recording. Many studies did not consider weaning method in their animal selection and some studies did not randomize animals into each treatment, identifying an opportunity for improvement in this area of research. Risk of bias was performed using JBI Critical Assessment Tools and a very low risk of bias was found for both randomized and (non-random) quasi-experiment trials. This systematic review examined studies varying in sample size, cattle age/sex and experimental design, showcasing a small yet diverse research area.},

	abstract = {Physical exercise is considered a well-tolerated adjuvant therapy to mitigate cancer-related side effects, but its impact on metastasis is unclear. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize the evidence on the effects of exercise on metastasis in animal cancer models. A systematic search was conducted to identify controlled studies in animals analyzing the impact of exercise interventions on any marker of metastasis incidence or severity. The pooled mean differences (PMD) were calculated for those endpoints for which a minimum of three studies used the same assessment method. We also calculated the pooled odds ratio (OR) of metastases. Twenty-six articles were included in the systematic review, of which 12 could be meta-analyzed. Exercise training in murine cancer models did not significantly modify the number of metastatic foci (PMD = - 3.18; 95\% confidence interval [CI] - 8.32, 1.97; p = 0.23), the weight of metastatic tumors (PMD = - 0.03; 95\% CI - 0.10, 0.04; p = 0.41), or the risk of developing metastasis (OR = 0.64; 95\% CI 0.10, 4.12; p = 0.64). These findings suggest that exercise has no overall influence on any marker of cancer metastasis incidence or severity in animal models. However, the wide methodological heterogeneity observed between studies might be taken into account and the potential exercise effects on metastasis development remain to be determined in pediatric tumors.},

It is recognized as safe by food safety authorities, but in recent years, governments and scientists have raised concerns about its genotoxicity. This systematic review aims to assess the potential associations between food TiO(2) exposure and microbiota composition and functions. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed up to December 2020 in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. The PRISMA guidelines followed. The risk of bias was assessed from ARRIVE and SYRCLE tools. RESULTS: A total of 18 animal studies were included (n = 10 mice, n = 5 rats, n = 2 fruit flies, n = 1 silkworm). Studies varied significantly in protocols and outcomes assessment. TiO(2) exposure might cause variations in abundance in specific bacterial species and lead to gut dysfunctions such as a reduction in SCFAs levels, goblet cells and crypts, mucus production, and increased biomarkers of intestinal inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Although the extrapolation of these results from animals to humans remains difficult, this review highlights the key role of gut microbiota in gut nanotoxicology and stimulates discussions on the safe TiO(2) use in food and dietary supplements.

Preclinical studies investigating RIC have shown RIC reduced infarct volume, but clinical trials have been equivocal. Therefore, the efficacy of RIC in reducing infarct volume and quality of current literature needs to be evaluated to identify knowledge gaps to support future clinical trials. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical literature involving RIC in rodent models of focal ischemia. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019145441). Eligibility criteria included rat or mice models of focal ischemia that received RIC to a limb either before, during, or after stroke. MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched from 1946 to August 2019. Risk of bias was assessed using the SYRCLE risk of bias tool along with construct validity. Seventy-two studies were included in the systematic review. RIC was shown to reduce infarct volume (SMD - 2.19; CI - 2.48 to - 1.91) when compared to stroke-only controls and no adverse events were reported with regard to RIC. Remote ischemic conditioning was shown to be most efficacious in males (SMD - 2.26; CI - 2.58 to - 1.94) and when delivered poststroke (SMD - 1.34; CI - 1.95 to - 0.73). A high risk of bias was present; thus, measures of efficacy may be exaggerated. A limitation is the poor methodological reporting of many studies, resulting in unclear construct validity. We identified several important, but under investigated topics including the efficacy of RIC in different stroke models, varied infarct sizes and location, and potential sex differences.},

Clinical evidence on the topic, however, remains controversial. A systematic review of preclinical evidence may help elucidate reasons for this contradictory evidence. The objective of our systematic review is to assess the anti-metastatic properties of LMWHs in solid tumour animal models. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and PubMed were searched from inception to May 12th, 2020. All articles were screened independently and in duplicate. Studies that compared LMWH to a placebo or no treatment arm in solid tumour animal models were included. The primary outcome was the burden of metastasis. Secondary outcomes included primary tumour growth and mortality. The risk of bias was assessed in duplicate using a modified Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS: Forty-two studies were included in the review. Administration of a LMWH was associated with a significant decrease in the burden of metastasis (SMD -2.18; 95\% CI -2.66 to -1.70). Additionally, the administration of a LMWH was also associated with a significant reduction in primary tumour growth (SMD -1.95; 95\% CI -2.56 to -1.34) and risk of death (RR 0.39; 95\% CI 0.16-0.97). All included studies were deemed to be at an unclear risk of bias for at least one methodological criterion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that LMWH can effectively reduce metastatic burden and reduce tumour growth in preclinical animal models of solid tumour malignancies. Reasons for the contradiction with clinical evidence require further exploration.},

	abstract = {Migratory animals are widely assumed to play an important role in the long-distance dispersal of parasites, and are frequently implicated in the global spread of zoonotic pathogens such as avian influenzas in birds and Ebola viruses in bats. However, infection imposes physiological and behavioural constraints on hosts that may act to curtail parasite dispersal via changes to migratory timing ("migratory separation") and survival ("migratory culling"). There remains little consensus regarding the frequency and extent to which migratory separation and migratory culling may operate, despite a growing recognition of the importance of these mechanisms in regulating transmission dynamics in migratory animals. We quantitatively reviewed 85 observations extracted from 41 studies to examine how both infection status and infection intensity are related to changes in body stores, refuelling rates, movement capacity, phenology and survival in migratory hosts across taxa. Overall, host infection status was weakly associated with reduced body stores, delayed migration and lower survival, and more strongly associated with reduced movement. Infection intensity was not associated with changes to host body stores, but was associated with moderate negative effects on movement, phenology and survival. In conclusion, we found evidence for negative effects of infection on host phenology and survival, but the effects were relatively small. This may have implications for the extent to which migratory separation and migratory culling act to limit parasite dispersal in migratory systems. We propose a number of recommendations for future research that will further advance our understanding of how migratory separation and migratory culling may shape host-parasite dynamics along migratory routes globally.},

We analysed all the national information regarding the prevalence of Giardia infections in humans, animals and environmental surveys over the last 40 years. In this work, we used Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines and the period between 1980 and 2019 was defined as time lapse for inclusion of the studies. The analysis was conducted using the LILACS, PubMed, Scopus and Argentina SciELO databases employing as keywords 'Giardia' AND 'Argentina'. We also carried out a manual review of papers. Of 304 articles, 92 fitted the eligibility criteria. Giardia was reported in 15 of the 23 Argentine provinces; human prevalence was between 3.4 and 64.8\%. Indigenous children and residents in peri-urban areas had the higher infection rates. In animals, Giardia was identified mainly in dogs with a prevalence of 8.9 ± 7.0\%, and studies of wild animals and cattle were notably scarce. Environmental studies showed that Giardia was detected in the soil and water which may act as reservoirs for this parasite revealing the need to modify the national water treatment legislation. The identification of Giardia genetic assemblages in the studies analysed was limited and showed that genotypes AII and B were found in humans while assemblage B was mainly detected in animals. This report provides useful information on epidemiological aspects of giardiasis in Argentina that may help to define future research priorities and provides useful tools for professionals regarding actual information on the prevalence of this infection.},

	abstract = {Paratuberculosis is an incurable infectious disease that affects several species, including goat (Capra hircus). The etiologic agent is Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) that has tropism for the intestine, causing anorexia, progressive weight loss and death. In goats, the main transmission route is the ingestion of water and food contaminated by infected feces. Affected animals also eliminate the agent through milk, with a potential biological risk to public health. Thus, the aim of this study was to conduct a research of the literature available in electronic media for a systematic review, followed by a meta-analysis of the results found on prevalence and diagnostic tests adopted in the detection of MAP antibodies and DNA in goat milk. The following search parameters were used: "Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis" AND (goat OR small ruminant) AND (milk OR pasteurized milk). Strictly obeying pre-established criteria, 437 articles were selected from the respective electronic databases of scientific content: ScienceDirect (285), PubMed (68), Web of Science (60) and Scopus (24), of which nine papers were elected to the construction of the systematic review and meta-analysis. The prevalence of MAP antibodies in milk detected by milk-ELISA ranged from 1.1 to 67.7\% and the prevalence of MAP DNA in goat milk detected by MAP-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ranged from 1.94 to 37.74\%. A meta-analysis indicated a combined MAP infection prevalence of 8.24\%, but with high heterogeneity among study findings (I$^{\textrm{2}}$ = 98.7\%). The identification of the MAP in goat milk implies the need for surveillance of the agent in order to prevent economic losses and impact on public health.},

	abstract = {Preventative healthcare consultations account for a large proportion of the veterinary caseload. This novel study is the first to methodically review all literature on canine and feline preventative healthcare consultations. Previous research has found these consultations to be different from health problem consultations in terms of communication style and content. Identifying relevant evidence and previously validated methods of measuring the success of these consultations will be useful when implementing strategies for optimisation. The aim of this study was to identify and assess the quality of existing literature which describes and/or measures the success of preventative healthcare consultations. Database searches of CAB Abstracts and Medline were conducted to identify published literature. Google searches were then conducted to identify any additional published or grey literature. Results were systematically screened to determine whether the returned sources were about cats and/or dogs, whether they related to preventative healthcare, and whether they described and/or measured the success of preventative healthcare consultations. For primary research citations which only described preventative healthcare consultations, data were extracted on the aspects of the consultations described. For citations which additionally measured the success of the consultations, the measures used, sampling technique, key results and key weaknesses were also extracted. Of 17,538 citations identified in total during the database searches, a total of seven relevant primary research citations were identified. All of these citations described aspects of the preventative healthcare consultation, such as consultation length, health problems discussed, actions taken and communication style. Only one primary research citation measured success of the consultation, using veterinarian satisfaction to determine success. In addition, 30 narrative citations, including expert opinion pieces, textbooks, guidelines without transparent methodology and conference presentations were identified. Google searches identified 224 relevant narrative citations, and five of the seven primary research citations identified by the database searches, but did not identify any additional relevant primary research citations. The results suggest that, despite accounting for around a third of all consultations, there is relatively little evidence describing preventative healthcare consultations and only one measure of success has been described for these consultations. This presents potential challenges when implementing strategies to optimise these consultations, as measures which are useful and relevant to veterinary practice should first be identified. Identifying useful measures of success will allow future strategies designed to maximise the benefits of these consultations to be meaningfully assessed for efficacy.},

	abstract = {Across the literature, there is large variation in lamb birth weight responses to changes in the ewe pregnancy nutrition. Much of this heterogeneity has been attributed to several factors inherent to each experiment; however, the relative contribution of these experimental factors has not yet been quantified. This meta-analysis aimed to systematically review the variation in lamb birth weight responses across nutritional studies involving adult multiparous ewes. Effect-sizes for individual studies were estimated using the unbiased estimator Hedges' g, whereby positive and negative values indicate heavier and lighter treatment lambs vs. controls, respectively. Heterogeneity varied between early-, mid- and late-pregnancy undernutrition studies (I2total [early pregnancy] = 19.90\%, I2total [midpregnancy] = 52.10\%, I2total [late pregnancy] = 68.70\%). The small average effects for early- (0.04, highest posterior density [HPD] interval = -0.22, 0.28) and mid-pregnancy undernutrition (-0.15, HPD interval = -0.35, 0.05) suggest that if farmers anticipate a potential feed shortage, ewes can be allowed to lose weight providing nutrition is resumed to adequate levels later in pregnancy. On the contrary, late-pregnancy undernutrition was associated with a significant decrease in lamb birth weight (-0.72, HPD interval = -0.86, -0.55). Thus, management practices should focus on ensuring adequate nutrition in late pregnancy. Increasing lamb birth weight could be possible by feeding ewes above their pregnancy maintenance requirement (0.23, HPD interval = 0.002, 0.48), though the number of studies is limited and further research is needed.},

We searched PubMed and Web of Science for publications that assessed the effects of handling, maternal separation (MS), and limited bedding and nesting (LBN) on performance in the Morris water maze (MWM), novel object recognition (NOR), and contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Forty-five studies met inclusion criteria (n = 451-763 rodents per test) and were used to calculate standardized mean differences (Hedge's g) and to assess heterogeneity, publication bias, and the moderating effects of sex and species (rats vs. mice). We found significantly lower heterogeneity in LBN compared to handling and MS with no consistent effects of sex or species across the three paradigms. LBN and MS caused similar cognitive deficits in tasks that rely heavily on the dorsal hippocampus, such as MWM and NOR, and were significantly different compared to the improved performance seen in rodents exposed to handling. In the CFC task, which relies more on the ventral hippocampus, all three paradigms showed reduced freezing with moderate effect sizes that were not statistically different. These findings demonstrate the utility of using meta-analysis to quantify outcomes in a large number of inconsistent preclinical studies and highlight the need to further investigate the possibility that handling causes different alterations in the dorsal hippocampus but similar outcomes in the ventral hippocampus when compared to MS and LBN.},

	abstract = {This meta-analysis of 39 experiments containing 118 treatments explored the effects of diet interventions in early lactation on the proportion of dairy cows pregnant to artificial insemination (AI; pregnancy to AI) and on calving to pregnancy interval. It also identified factors that may explain variation in these responses. The objectives were to identify effects of diet on reproduction, rather than differences between specific dietary interventions. The examination of calving to pregnancy interval used the more traditional method of analyzing differences between a treatment and the reference treatment used for comparison within a given experiment. The systematic review identified fewer experiments (n = 39) than had been expected. Four different multivariable models including the random effect of experiment were used to examine the effects of CPM-Dairy (version 3.08) estimated diet and production variables on proportion pregnant to AI. These models examined (1) output of products, (2) balance or duodenal availability of nutrients, (3) intake of nutrients, or (4) percentage of nutrients in the diet. The multivariable models identified positive associations between estimated increased fatty acid intake [incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.0003 ± 0.0001g/d; ±standard error], starch intake (IRR = 1.061 ± 0.029 kg/d), metabolizable energy balance (IRR = 1.004 ± 0.002 MJ/d), and duodenal C14:0 (IRR = 1.008 ± 0.004 g/d) availability with the proportion of cows pregnant to AI, whereas rapidly fermentable sugar intake (IRR = 0.813 ± 0.054 kg/d), percentage of sugar in the diet (IRR = 0.960 ± 0.015\%), and milk protein yield (IRR 0.922 ± 0.022 g/100 g per day) were associated with a reduced proportion of cows pregnant to AI. There was no multivariable model developed to assess variables associated with calving to pregnancy interval but, univariably, increased metabolizable energy balance was associated with a shorter calving to pregnancy interval whereas increased milk production was associated with longer time to pregnancy. Increased intake of some AA, particularly threonine and lysine, were associated with a longer calving to pregnancy interval. It is clear nutritional management around calving can influence reproductive success. The importance of dietary fats and increased energy and protein balances in early lactation for improved fertility outcomes is supported and suggests that starch and sugars may have different effects on the proportion of cows that are pregnant to AI. This work also highlighted a need for further focused field studies exploring the roles of specific fatty acids, AA, phosphorus, and carbohydrates on reproduction.},

Improved diagnosis and prognosis of brain injury may be possible by examining changes in protein biomarker concentrations and, determining their role in long-term outcomes may improve treatment. One promising direction for biomarker research surrounds pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines which may have utility for predicting short and long-term prognosis after TBI, and may also be therapeutic targets in shaping neuronal recovery following a TBI. The purpose of this review is to examine the relationship between TBI symptoms and changes in pro- and anti- inflammatory biomarkers. Eighteen (18) published articles met criteria for inclusion. Fourteen studies focused on individuals with severe TBI. Increased levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, IL-8, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) were associated with worse outcomes, with most studies focusing on morbidity and mortality. It is important to identify the biochemical changes that may influence or initiate the presentation of health outcomes after a TBI. Earlier identification of symptoms associated with these biochemical changes can be used to support better treatment planning, targeted interventions and ultimately, improvement in patient outcomes.},

The present study showed that seropositive goats were 3.07 times more likely to abort (OR 3.07; 95 \% CI 1.02-9.22) than seronegative animals. The presence of dogs on farms also increased the odds of N. caninum seropositivity (OR 1.40; 95 \% CI 1.01-1.94). In addition, male animals had higher odds of being seropositive to neosporosis than females (OR 1.31; 95 \% CI 1.00-1.71). N. caninum seroprevalence in goats is widely distributed worldwide, with the American continent having a higher proportion of seropositive animals.},

	abstract = {Beyond the functional tasks that assistance dogs are trained for, there is growing literature describing their benefits on the psychosocial health and wellbeing of their handlers. However, this research is not only widely disparate but, despite its growth, has not been reviewed since 2012. Our objective was to identify, summarize, and methodologically evaluate studies quantifying the psychosocial effects of assistance dogs for individuals with physical disabilities. Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review was conducted across seven electronic databases. Records were independently screened by two authors. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they assessed outcomes from guide, hearing, medical, or mobility service dogs, if they collected original data on handlers' psychosocial functioning, and if the outcome was measured quantitatively with a validated, standardized measure. Studies on psychiatric service dogs, emotional support dogs, and pet dogs were excluded. Of 1,830 records screened, 24 articles were identified (12 publications, 12 theses) containing 27 studies (15 cross-sectional, 12 longitudinal). Studies assessed the effects of mobility (18), hearing (7), guide (4), and medical (2) assistance dog partnerships with an average sample size of N = 83. An analysis of 147 statistical comparisons across the domains of psychological health, quality of life, social health, and vitality found that 68\% of comparisons were null, 30\% were positive in the hypothesized direction, and 2\% were negative. Positive outcomes included significant effects of having an assistance dog on psychological wellbeing, emotional functioning, self-esteem, and vitality. However, it is of note that several methodological weaknesses of the studies make it difficult to draw any definitive conclusions, including inadequate reporting and a failure to account for moderating or confounding variables. Future research will benefit from stronger methodological rigor and reporting to account for heterogeneity in both humans and assistance dogs as well as continued high-quality replication.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The heterogeneity of Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates among triatomines insects and animal reservoirs has been studied in independent studies, but little information has been systematised to allow pooled and comparative estimates. Unravelling the main patterns of this heterogeneity could contribute to a further understanding of T. cruzi transmission in Colombia. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Medline, LILACS, Embase, Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar and secondary sources with no filters of language or time and until April 2018. Based on selection criteria, all relevant studies reporting T. cruzi infection rates in reservoirs or triatomines were chosen. For pooled analyses, a random effects model for binomial distribution was used. Heterogeneity among studies is reported as I(2). Subgroup analyses included: taxonomic classification, ecotope and diagnostic methods. Publication bias and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Overall, 39 studies reporting infection rates in Colombia were found (22 for potential reservoirs and 28 for triatomine insects) for a total sample of 22,838 potential animals and 11,307 triatomines evaluated for T. cruzi infection. We have found evidence of 38/71 different animal species as potential T. cruzi reservoirs and 14/18 species as triatomine vectors for T. cruzi. Among animals, the species with the highest pooled prevalence were opossum (Didelphis marsupialis) with 48.0\% (95\% CI: 26-71\%; I(2) = 88\%, τ(2) = 0.07, P {\textless} 0.01) and domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) with 22.0\% (95\% CI: 4-48\%; I(2) = 96\%, τ(2) = 0.01, P {\textless} 0.01). Among triatomines, the highest prevalence was found for Triatoma maculata in the peridomestic ecotope (68.0\%, 95\% CI: 62-74\%; I(2) = 0\%, τ(2) = 0, P {\textless} 0.0001), followed by Rhodnius prolixus (62.0\%, 95\% CI: 38-84\%; I(2) = 95\%, τ(2) = 0.05, P {\textless} 0.01) and Rhodnius pallescens (54.0\%, 95\% CI: 37-71\%; I(2) = 86\%, τ(2) = 0.035, P {\textless} 0.01) in the sylvatic ecotope. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic and quantitative analyses of triatomine insects and potential animal reservoirs for T. cruzi infection in Colombia. The results highlight a marked heterogeneity between species and provide initial estimates of infection rates heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The history of medical application of propolis (also known as bee glue) dates back to the times of ancient Greeks, Romans, Persians and Egyptians. Honey and other bee products, including propolis, occupy an important place in Polish folk medicine. Scientific research on propolis in Poland began in the early 1960s in Zabrze and continues until now. AIM OF THE REVIEW: The aim of this review is to provide an overview of information on Polish research on propolis and its medical application with particular emphasis on studies concerning wound healing. Consequently, our goal is also to shed a new light on therapeutic potential of Polish propolis in order to support future research in the field. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of scientific literature on propolis and its medical application was performed by using the literature databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar). We paid special attention to papers describing the effect of propolis on skin wound healing as well as to Polish contribution to research on propolis. RESULTS: Professor Stan Scheller was the first Polish scientist dealing with propolis and its medical potential. His legacy was continued by several research teams that studied the topic in various aspects. They analyzed propolis composition, its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiapoptotic and anticancer properties as well as its application in dentistry and wound treatment. Burn wound healing physiology after propolis administration was thoroughly studied on pig model, whereas research on patients proved the efficacy of propolis in chronic venous leg ulcer treatment. CONCLUSION: Polish scientists have made a significant contribution to the research on propolis, its biological properties and influence on wound healing. Propolis ointments can effectively accelerate the healing process and improve healing physiology, so they can be recommended as a promising topical medication for wound treatment in the future clinical and preclinical trials.},

By using the SCOPUS database, the academic Google search engine, and Microsoft Office 2010 Excel, each species was designated with the same criterion to identify those with anthelmintic activity and qualitative phytochemical content; then, the groups with the highest analysis were identified, and the species with simultaneous analysis were selected from the 3 chemical groups with the highest frequency, and the weight gain AND sheep search criteria was applied to the resulting group. 45 native, 6 naturalized, and 20 exotic species with anthelmintic activity were found. The Fabaceae (13 species), Amaranthaceae (4 species), Annonaceae, Apocynaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Malvaceae (3 species each) families stand out. The three chemical groups with the high LEVELS OF PHYTOCHEMICALS were tannins, flavonoids, and alkaloids, and at a medium level saponins, steroids, and terpenoids.

	abstract = {High values of ambient temperature and relative humidity negatively affect livestock because they induce heat stress. In heat-stressed ewes, the reproduction is affected, although there apparently is a different effect depending on their physiological status. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses to estimate the effect of heat stress on the reproductive performance and physiology of cycling or pregnant ewes. We included studies in which pregnant or cycling ewes were exposed to heat stress and included a comparison group. We assessed the risk of bias and used meta-analyses that included the period of exposure to calculate pooled estimates. We included 36 studies comprising 20,626 ewes, and the meta-analyses demonstrated that heat stress decreased 7.09 h (95\% CI, - 10.75, - 3.43) the duration of estrus in cycling ewes but increased 0.57 days (95\% CI, 0.23, 0.92) the length of the cycle, although differentially affecting the expression of sexual behavior. Heat-stressed cycling ewes had greater odds of embryo mortality (OR = 12.36; 95\% CI, 7.10, 21.54) and a decreased chance of impregnation (OR = 0.41; 95\% CI, 0.23, 0.75). In heat-stressed pregnant ewes, placental and fetal weights were reduced, respectively in 183.62 g (95\%CI, - 252.25, - 114.99) and 1665.18 g (95\% CI, - 2136.82, - 1193.55). Heat stress increased ewes' body temperature 1.13 °C (95\% CI, 0.85, 1.42) and respiratory rate 93.53 breaths/min (95\% CI, 63.5, 123.5) without affecting heart rate. In a sub-group analyses, the period of exposure was shown to cause a significant effect. In conclusion, our results revealed a differential effect of heat stress that depends on both the physiological status of ewes and the period of exposure, and identify susceptible reproductive stages during which the severe effects of heat stress can be prevented/ameliorated.},

	doi = {10.1111/brv.12329},
	abstract = {Early survival is highly variable and strongly influences observed population growth rates in most vertebrate populations. One of the major potential drivers of survival variation among juveniles is body mass. Heavy juveniles are better fed and have greater body reserves, and are thus assumed to survive better than light individuals. In spite of this, some studies have failed to detect an influence of body mass on offspring survival, questioning whether offspring body mass does indeed consistently influence juvenile survival, or whether this occurs in particular species/environments. Furthermore, the causes for variation in offspring mass are poorly understood, although maternal mass has often been reported to play a crucial role. To understand why offspring differ in body mass, and how this influences juvenile survival, we performed phylogenetically corrected meta-analyses of both the relationship between offspring body mass and offspring survival in birds and mammals and the relationship between maternal mass and offspring mass in mammals. We found strong support for an overall positive effect of offspring body mass on survival, with a more pronounced influence in mammals than in birds. An increase of one standard deviation of body mass increased the odds of offspring survival by 71\% in mammals and by 44\% in birds. A cost of being too fat in birds in terms of flight performance might explain why body mass is a less reliable predictor of offspring survival in birds. We then looked for moderators explaining the among-study differences reported in the intensity of this relationship. Surprisingly, sex did not influence the intensity of the offspring mass-survival relationship and phylogeny only accounted for a small proportion of observed variation in the intensity of that relationship. Among the potential factors that might affect the relationship between mass and survival in juveniles, only environmental conditions was influential in mammals. Offspring survival was most strongly influenced by body mass in captive populations and wild populations in the absence of predation. We also found support for the expected positive effect of maternal mass on offspring mass in mammals (r(pearson)  = 0.387). As body mass is a strong predictor of early survival, we expected heavier mothers to allocate more to their offspring, leading them to be heavier and so to have a higher survival. However, none of the potential factors we tested for variation in the maternal mass-offspring mass relationship had a detectable influence. Further studies should focus on linking these two relationships to determine whether a strong effect of offspring size on early survival is associated with a high correlation coefficient between maternal mass and offspring mass.},

	abstract = {Wound healing is a perfectly coordinated cascade of cellular, molecular, and biochemical events which interact in tissue reconstitution. Chronic diseases such as pressure ulcers (PU) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are considered risk factors for wound healing. Patients with such diseases often have higher sepsis, infection, and complication rates, since they have revascularization inhibition and low growth factor expression. Thus, latex biomembrane (LBM), a biocompatible material, derived from the latex of the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) appears to create tendencies as an angiogenic-inducing tissue healing agent and as biomaterial, resulting from its structural qualities and its low cost when compared to conventional treatments. Therefore, this work aims at summarizing the results, experiments, and scientific findings that certify or recommend the use of LBM as a new technique to be applied effectively in the treatment of wounds. An integrative review was held in the BIREME, LILACS, Burns, MEDLINE, PubMed, and SciELO databases, from 2000 to 2016, using the following descriptors: "healing," "diabetes mellitus," "wounds," and "latex membrane." As a result, 600 experiments (out of 612) presented satisfactory results; however, 33\% of the cases received explicit recommendations, 11\% required more studies on the subjects, and 1\% was denied. On the other hand, half of the studies did not expressly endorse its use, despite presenting satisfactory results. The LBM was characterized as a good therapeutic alternative in cases of wounds, including chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus and PU, due to its relevant potential for wound healing stimulation, acceleration of cell tissue mending and revascularization, or the reestablishment of angiogenic functions (creation of new blood vessels). The LBM was also confirmed to be safe as a biocompatible material whose structural qualities (elasticity, adaptability, impermeability, and possibility of suture), devoid of toxicity, allowed interaction between tissues and presented no hypersensitivity inducer and no antimicrobial effect.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cisplatin is one the most frequently used chemotherapeutic drugs for several decades. Although its antineoplastic effect has been reported in treatment of numerous malignances, various adverse effects seem to be the crucial limiting factor for its administration. OBJECTIVE: Beside the most commonly described nephro- and hepatotoxicity, cisplatin therapy is also accompanied with gastrointestinal, reproductive, hematological, cardiovascular and neurological side effects. Since it has been reported that cisplatin induce oxidative damage in various tissues, it seems reasonable to investigate an antioxidant supplementation as potential therapeutical approach for attenuation of cisplatin toxicities. METHODS: We performed a structured search of bibliographic databases for research literature using a focused review question and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The quality of retrieved papers (101 in total) was appraised using standard tools. RESULTS: Numerous antioxidants (such as thiol compounds, polyphenols, vitamins, etc.) had been reported for their beneficial effects on cisplatin-induced cardiotoxicity. The effects of various antioxidants, including sulfur-containing amino acids, have also been explored for mitigation of cisplatin neurotoxicity. However, the results for antioxidant supplementation in reduction of cisplatin-induced toxicities are still to be applied in clinical trials. CONCLUSION: Considering the facts that sulfur-containing amino acids: (a) do not interfere with chemotherapeutics antitumor action; (b) do not exhibit any toxic effect (unless applied in dose several times above the recommended); and (c) produce significant protective effects on some cisplatin-induced toxicities connected to augmentation of oxidative damage - it seems that their administration can be harmless and protective supplementation against numerous adverse effects of certain antineoplastic agents.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Taenia saginata taeniosis/cysticercosis has been well studied in several countries. Brazil is one of the most important beef exporting countries and has one of the highest cattle population size in the world. In this country, bovine cysticercosis (BCC) remains the most frequent reported zoonosis detected during post-mortem inspection, resulting in costs for the beef sector and public health. We performed a systematic literature review regarding data about BCC epidemiology in Brazil and meta-analyses for its prevalence in different administrative regions and the distribution over time, and based on this discussed possible control strategies. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to obtain data about BCC in Brazil using the words "bovine cysticercosis" and "Brazil" to construct the search phrase. The inclusion criteria used to select articles were: (i) published from 2000 to 2018; (ii) full text available online in Portuguese or English; and (iii) contain information at least regarding one of the following aspects of BCC in Brazil: prevalence, incidence, spatial distribution, risk-factors, economic burden and measures for control. RESULTS: A set of 42 articles was included, covering the prevalence of BCC in Brazil, ranging between 0.01-18.75\%. Prevalence results of 40 articles were included in a meta-analysis per administrative region. The highest prevalence was found in the South (3.4\%; 95\% CI: 2.0-5.2\%), followed by the Southeast (2.7\%; 95\% CI: 1.9-3.6\%), Northeast (1.5\%; 95\% CI: 0.6-2.7\%), Central-western (0.9\%; 95\% CI: 0.3-1.7\%) and North (0.0\%; 95\% CI: 0.0-0.6\%) region. In addition, a reduction in prevalence over time was observed in all the evaluated states except for Alagoas and Pará. CONCLUSIONS: Besides the large availability of data, a critical lack of information about BCC epidemiology remains in Brazil. Nevertheless, the available data on prevalence, high risk-areas and risk factors should contribute to a better understanding of transmission and the formulation of recommendations for control. A One Health approach will be required to reduce T. saginata taeniosis/cysticercosis prevalence and the consequent economic burden for the beef sector in Brazil, one of the most important beef exporters in the world.},

	abstract = {The objective of this meta-analysis was to summarize available information on the prevalence of thermotolerant Campylobacter (TC) in different food-producing animals worldwide. Databases (i.e., PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus) were searched from 1980 to 2017 unrestricted by language. The inclusion criteria were as follows: prevalence or incidence studies, published in peer-reviewed journals, and they must have reported the total number of animal samples studied and the number of samples that were positive for the presence of TC. When the identification of Campylobacter species was available, this information was included in the analysis. Multilevel random-effect meta-analysis models were fitted to estimate mean occurrence rate of TC and to compare them among different factors potentially associated with the outcome. The mean occurrence rate of TC in food-producing animals was 0.424 (95\% CI: 0.394-0.455), and the mean occurrence rate of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were 0.214 and 0.133, respectively. Pigs and poultry showed the highest prevalence of TC; however, there were differences in the prevalence of each Campylobacter species. Campylobacter jejuni was observed in broilers (0.322; 95\% CI: 0.273-0.377) and hens (0.395; 95\% CI: 0.265-0.542), while C. coli was restricted essentially in pigs (0.553; 95\% CI: 0.541-0.650). The prevalence of C. jejuni in intensively bred cattle was higher (0.302; 95\% CI: 0.227-0.389) than the prevalence in extensively bred cattle (0.172; 95\% CI: 0.119-0.242) while the prevalence of C. coli was similar (0.051; 95\% CI: 0.028-0.091 vs. 0.050; 95\% CI: 0.027-0.091) in both production systems. Agar with or without blood used for the isolation of TC did not affect the prevalence observed. The method of species identification did not seem to generate differences in the prevalence of Campylobacter species. The prevalence of Campylobacter in primary food production has a strong impact on the entire agri-food chain. National authorities must monitor the situation with the aim to establish the appropriate risk management measures.},

The application of biomaterials has emerged in bone reconstructive surgery, especially the use of bovine bone due to its biocompatibility. Due to the many benefits related to the use of PBMT and bovine bones, the aim of this research was to review the literature to verify the relationship between PBMT and the application of bovine bone in bone reconstruction surgeries. We chose the PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases for the search by matching the keywords: "Bovine bone AND low-level laser therapy", "Bovine bone AND photobiomodulation therapy", "Xenograft AND low-level laser therapy", and "Xenograft AND photobiomodulation therapy". The initial search of the three databases retrieved 240 articles, 18 of which met all inclusion criteria. In the studies concerning animals (17 in total), there was evidence of PBMT assisting in biomaterial-related conduction, formation of new bone, bone healing, immunomarker expression, increasing collagen fibers, and local inflammation reduction. However, the results disagreed with regard to the resorption of biomaterial particles. The only human study showed that PBMT with bovine bone was effective for periodontal regeneration. It was concluded that PBMT assists the process in bone reconstruction when associated with bovine bone, despite divergences between applied protocols.},

Wild boar is the second most important source of trichinellosis for humans. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the global seroprevalence of Trichinella infection among wild boar. We searched five major databases for studies reporting Trichinella spp. seroprevalence in wild boar between January 1995 and January 2018. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled seroprevalence of Trichinella in wild boar. A total of 21 studies involving 16,327 wild boar from 15 countries were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled seroprevalence for Trichinella infection in wild boar was 6\% (95\% CI: 3-10\%; 1084/16327). The estimated seroprevalence in North America was 9\% (95\% CI, 1-25\%), in Europe 7\% (95\% CI, 3-13\%), in Asia 3\% (95\% CI, 0.0-11\%) and in Oceania 3\% (95\% CI, 2-4\%). Geographical location, gender and age were not significantly associated with seropositivity. In sub-group analysis, the pooled seroprevalence of Trichinella infection in wild boar when ELISA was used as the diagnostic test (16\%; 95\% CI, 4-34\%) was significantly higher when compared to western blot (4\%; 95\% CI, 0-12\%). These results emphasize that wild boars are a potential source for acquisition of Trichinella infection in humans, and surveillance programs should be implemented in high-risk countries.},

	abstract = {Dogs serve as the most important definitive hosts for Toxocara canis-a causative agent of human toxocariasis and one of the most widespread zoonotic helminth worldwide. The present study was undertaken to assess the global prevalence of T. canis infection in dogs. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE and SciELO were searched to identify relevant studies. A random-effects model was used to estimate the overall and the subgroup-pooled prevalences across studies, and heterogeneity was assessed via the I(2) test. The data were categorized according to WHO-region, different types of dogs, risk factors and environmental variables. From a total of 4370 peer-reviewed publications, 229 articles that studied 13,010,004 dogs in 60 countries met the final inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of Toxocara infection in dogs was 11.1\% (95\% CI, 10.6-11.7\%). The estimated prevalence in the different WHO-regions ranged from 6.4\% to 19.2\%: Eastern Mediterranean (19.2\%, 13.7-25.5\%), Africa (18.5\%, 13.7-23.9\%), South-East Asia (11.9\%, 6.8-18.2\%), North America (11.1\%, 10.6-11.7\%), South America (10.9\%, 7.6-14.6\%), Europe (10.8\%, 8.9-12.9\%) and Western Pacific (6.4\%, 3.3-10.2\%). Young ({\textless}1 year of age), stray, rural and male dogs had a significantly (P{\textless}0.001) higher prevalence of infection than older, pet, urban or female dogs. The prevalence was higher in low income countries and regions at a low geographical latitude, close to the equator, characterized as having tropical climates. From this review, it is estimated that ≥100 million dogs are infected with Toxocara around the world. This highlights the need for an increased focus on implementing affordable, appropriate control programs to reduce the public health threat of toxocariasis as a zoonosis of global importance.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human toxocariasis is an important neglected disease. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis study to estimate the global and regional prevalence of anti-Toxocara serum antibodies (referred to as 'T-seroprevalence') in human populations around the world. METHODS: We searched five international databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, SciELO and Scopus) for seroprevalence studies published from 1 January 1980 to 15 March 2019. We used random effect models to calculate the overall T-seroprevalence (with 95\% CIs) in all six WHO regions and worldwide. We also conducted subgroup and linear meta-regression analyses to evaluate the impact of socio-demographic, geographical and climatic parameters on seroprevalence. RESULTS: We identified 250 eligible studies (253 datasets) comprising 265,327 participants in 71 countries for inclusion in the present meta-analysis. The estimated global T-seroprevalence rate was 19.0\% (95\%CI, 16.6-21.4\%; 62,927/265,327); seroprevalence was highest in the African region (37.7\%; 25.7-50.6\%) and lowest in the Eastern Mediterranean region (8.2\%; 5.1-12.0\%). The pooled seroprevalence for other WHO regions was 34.1\% (20.2-49.4\%) in the South-East Asia; 24.2\% (16.0-33.5\%) in the Western Pacific; 22.8\% (19.7-26.0\%) in the American; and 10.5\% (8.5-12.8\%) in the European regions. A significantly higher T-seroprevalence was associated with a lower income level; lower human development index (HDI); lower latitude; higher humidity; higher temperature; and higher precipitation (P-value {\textless} 0.001). Potential risk factors associated with seropositivity to Toxocara included male gender; living in a rural area; young age; close contact with dogs, cats or soil; consumption of raw meat; and the drinking of untreated water. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings indicate high levels of infection with, or exposure to Toxocara spp. in many countries, which calls for increased attention to human toxocariasis and improved measures to prevent adverse health risks of this disease.},

	abstract = {Zoonotic parasites, including Toxocara species, of pet and stray cats are of public health importance. Justification for, and the design and implementation of prevention and control of human toxocariasis may benefit from an understanding of the zoonotic potential and prevalence of parasites in this definitive host species. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies, conducted to estimate the prevalence of Toxocara infection(s) in cats by geographical location, type (rural vs urban and stray vs pet), gender and age. Pooled data were assessed using a random effects-model as well as several meta-regression and stratified analyses conducted. Of 1733 peer-reviewed articles, 143 were included in this review and represented 2,158,069 cats from 51 countries. The global pooled (95\% CI) prevalence of Toxocara infection in cats was 17.0\% (16.1-17.8\%), being highest in African (43.3\%, 28.3-58.4\%) and lowest in South American (12.6\%, 8.2-17.0\%) countries. In other WHO regions, prevalence rates of Toxocara were as follows: Eastern Mediterranean (21.6\%, 15.1-28.1\%), North America (18.3\%, 15.4-21.2\%), Europe (17.8\%, 15.9-19.7\%), Western Pacific (17.3\%, 14.7-19.9\%), and South-East Asia (14.9\%, 9.8-20.1\%). Prevalence of Toxocara was higher in low-income tropical countries and also in stray (28.6\%, 25.1-32.1\%) and young (≤12 months of age) (27.7\%, 23.4-32.0\%) cats than in pet (11.6\%, 10.7-12.5\%) and older cats ({\textgreater}12 months of age) (23.8\%, 14.8-32.7\%). This review indicates that {\textasciitilde}118-150 million cats worldwide serve as definitive hosts of Toxocara, shedding eggs and thus contributing to the public health risk of human infection. Prevention and control of this zoonosis in cats should receive greater attention by health officials and cat owners, particularly in countries where risk factors and prevalence are highest.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Development of a hyper-gonadotropic hypoestrogenism condition in women {\textless} 40 years, defined as premature ovarian insufficiency (POI), is the most common long-term complication in female survivors of galactosemia. In this systematic review, summarize the galactose (GAL) induced POI in rat and mice models. METHODS: For this systematic review, we conducted a search of case control studies published from 1990 until August 2018 in PubMed/Medline, and Web of science, using the descriptors in the title/abstract field. A 'pearl growing' strategy was employed whereby, after obtaining the full text articles, reference lists of all included studies (n = 14) were reviewed for additional publications that could be used. RESULTS: We selected and categorized 14 studies according to the time of exposure to GAL into two groups of prenatal (n = 4) and postnatal (n = 10). Findings of these studies showed that the different stages of follicular development are targeted differently by galactose exposure during the prenatal and postnatal periods: The small follicles (primordial and primary follicles) are targeted by galactose toxicity during prenatal exposure and the pre-antral and antral follicles are targeted by galactose toxicity during postnatal exposure. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review shows that galactose has an ovotoxicity effect that can be used to induce appropriate POI animal models only if sufficient doses, proper onset time, and duration of prenatal exposure are taken into account. An optimized model of POI induction should manifest all the required ovarian morphological, hormonal, and estrus cycle changes.},

	abstract = {Leishmania infantum is the main cause of human visceral leishmaniasis (HVL; also known as kala-azar) in the Middle East and may be fatal if left untreated. This disease was ﬁrst reported in 1949 in Iran. Despite marked improvements in hygiene and sanitation conditions, the disease is still endemic in some parts of Iran. It is difficult to determine the current prevalence of HVL in Iran due to the scarcity of comprehensive studies in this regard. In response to this gap, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to gain better understanding of HVL epidemiology in the general population of Iran. English and Persian databases were searched for studies reporting the prevalence and risk factors associated with HVL in the Iranian people from January 1995 to December 2019. The reported data were selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of HVL infection and its 95 \% confidence intervals were calculated. Quality assessment, heterogeneity testing and publication bias assessment were also done. Literature search revealed 3634 studies, of which 35 studies met our eligibility criteria, with a total of 50,716 individuals. The meta-analysis was performed on 31 out of 35 included studies. The estimated pooled prevalence of HVL infection according to seropositivity was 2\% (95 \% CI: 1-2\%) in the general population of Iran in which western and northern provinces had the lowest and the highest prevalence, 0.5 \% (95 \%CI, 0.2-0.7\%) and 3\% (95 \%CI, 1-5 \%), respectively. The seroprevalence of HVL among females (2\%; 95 \%CI, 1-2 \%) was more than males (1\%; 95 \%CI, 1-2 \%). The ≤10 and {\textgreater}10 years age groups had similar seroprevalence rates (1\%, 95 \%CI, 1-2 \% versus 1\%, 95 \%CI, 0-1 \%, respectively). There was no signiﬁcant difference in terms of geographic area, age and sex. Of 31 studies included in the meta-analysis, the most common diagnostic test was the direct agglutination test (96.77 \%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst systematic review of the prevalence of HVL in Iran. The results showed a low seroprevalence of HVL infection. However, the lack of published reports of HVL in an area does not exclusively mean the absence of the disease or carrier. We therefore recommend further studies in this regard.},

	abstract = {Yersinia pestis, a bacterial pathogen that causes sylvatic plague, is present in the prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.) of North America. Epizootics of sylvatic plague through transmission in vectors (fleas) commonly completely extirpate colonies of prairie dogs. Wildlife managers employ a wide variety of insecticidal treatments to suppress plague and conserve prairie dog colonies. I compiled and statistically compared the available literature describing methods of plague control and their relative effectiveness in managing plague outbreaks by using meta-analyses. Natural log response ratios were used to calculate insecticide-induced vector mortality and vaccine-conferred survival increases in prairie dogs in 37 publications. Further, subgroupings were used to explore the most effective of the available vector suppression insecticides and plague suppression vaccines. After accounting for the type of treatment used and the method by which it was applied, I observed plague reduction through use of both insecticides and vaccines. Insecticides resulted in a significant reduction of the abundance of vectors by 91.34\% compared to non-treated hosts (p{\textless}0.0001). Vaccines improved survival of prairie dog hosts by 4.00\% (p{\textless}0.0001) compared to control populations. The use of insecticides such as deltamethrin and carbaryl is recommended to stop actively spreading epizootics, and dual antigen oral vaccines to initially suppress outbreaks.},

However, it remains unclear whether the goal of PLF development has been to improve welfare or increase production efficiency. The aims of this systematic literature review are to provide an overview of the current state of PLF in poultry farming and investigate whether the focus of PLF research has been to improve bird welfare. The study characteristics extracted from 264 peer-reviewed publications and conference proceedings suggest that poultry PLF has received increasing attention on a global scale, but is yet to become a widespread commercial reality. PLF development has most commonly focussed on broiler farming, followed by laying hens, and mainly involves the use of sensors (environmental and wearable) and cameras. More publications had animal health and welfare than production as either one of or the only goal, suggesting that PLF development so far has focussed on improving animal health and welfare. Future work should prioritise improving the rate of commercialisation of PLF systems, so that their potential to improve bird welfare might be realised.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13071-019-3340-z},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sarcoptic mange, caused by the Sarcoptes scabiei mite, is an infectious disease of wildlife, domestic animals and humans with international importance. Whilst a variety of treatment and control methods have been investigated in wildlife, the literature is fragmented and lacking consensus. The primary objectives of this review were to synthesise the diverse literature published on the treatment of sarcoptic mange in wildlife from around the world, and to identify the qualities of successful treatment strategies in both captive and free-roaming wildlife. METHODS: A systematic search of the electronic databases CAB Direct, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE and Discovery was undertaken. Data pertaining to study design, country, year, species, study size, mange severity, treatment protocol and outcomes were extracted from eligible studies and placed in a table. Following data extraction, a decision tree was used to identify studies suitable for further analysis based on the effectiveness of their treatment protocol, whether they were conducted on captive or non-captive wildlife, and the quality of their post-treatment monitoring period. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies met our initial inclusion criteria for data collection. Of these studies, 15 were selected for further analysis following application of the decision tree. This comprised of 9 studies on captive wildlife, 5 studies on free-living wildlife and 1 study involving both captive and free-living wildlife. Ivermectin delivered multiple times via subcutaneous injection at a dose between 200-400 µg/kg was found to be the most common and successfully used treatment, although long-term data on post-release survival and re-infection rates was elusive. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this review is the first to demonstrate that multiple therapeutic protocols exist for the treatment of sarcoptic mange in wildlife. However, several contemporary treatment options are yet to be formally reported in wildlife, such as the use of isoxazoline chemicals as a one-off treatment. There is also a strong indication for more randomised controlled trials, as well as improved methods of post-treatment monitoring. Advancing this field of knowledge is expected to aid veterinarians, wildlife workers and policy makers with the design and implementation of effective treatment and management strategies for the conservation of wildlife affected by sarcoptic mange.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13071-021-04700-x},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites that can infect nearly all invertebrates and vertebrates, posing a threat to public health and causing large economic losses to animal industries such as those of honeybees, silkworms and shrimp. However, the global epidemiology of these pathogens is far from illuminated. METHODS: Publications on microsporidian infections were obtained from PubMed, Science Direct and Web of Science and filtered according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Infection data about pathogens, hosts, geography and sampling dates were manually retrieved from the publications and screened for high quality. Prevalence rates and risk factors for different pathogens and hosts were analyzed by conducting a meta-analysis. The geographic distribution and seasonal prevalence of microsporidian infections were drawn and summarized according to sampling locations and date, respectively. RESULTS: Altogether, 287 out of 4129 publications up to 31 January 2020 were obtained and met the requirements, from which 385 epidemiological data records were retrieved and effective. The overall prevalence rates in humans, pigs, dogs, cats, cattle, sheep, nonhuman primates and fowl were 10.2\% [2429/30,354; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 9.2-11.2\%], 39.3\% (2709/5105; 95\% CI 28.5-50.1\%), 8.8\% (228/2890; 95\% CI 5.1-10.1\%), 8.1\% (112/1226; 95\% CI 5.5-10.8\%), 16.6\% (2216/12,175; 95\% CI 13.5-19.8\%), 24.9\% (1142/5967; 95\% CI 18.6-31.1\%), 18.5\% (1388/7009; 95\% CI 13.1-23.8\%) and 7.8\% (725/9243; 95\% CI 6.4-9.2\%), respectively. The higher prevalence in pigs suggests that routine detection of microsporidia in animals should be given more attention, considering their potential roles in zoonotic disease. The highest rate was detected in water, 58.5\% (869/1351; 95\% CI 41.6-75.5\%), indicating that water is an important source of infections. Univariate regression analysis showed that CD4+ T cell counts and the living environment are significant risk factors for humans and nonhuman primates, respectively. Geographically, microsporidia have been widely found in 92 countries, among which Northern Europe and South Africa have the highest prevalence. In terms of seasonality, the most prevalent taxa, Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Encephalitozoon, display different prevalence trends, but no significant difference between seasons was observed. In addition to having a high prevalence, microsporidia are extremely divergent because 728 genotypes have been identified in 7 species. Although less investigated, microsporidia coinfections are more common with human immunodeficiency virus and Cryptosporidium than with other pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the largest-scale meta-analysis to date on microsporidia prevalence in mammals, birds and water worldwide. The results suggest that microsporidia are highly divergent, widespread and prevalent in some animals and water and should be further investigated to better understand their epidemic features.},

	abstract = {Obesity is associated with the production of inflammatory cytokines that are implicated in insulin resistance (IR), and if not addressed, can lead to type 2 diabetes (T2D). The role of the immune system in skeletal muscle (SM) inflammation and insulin sensitivity is not yet well characterized. As SM IR is an important determinant of glycaemia, it is critical that the muscle-immune phenotype is mapped to help design interventions to target T2D. This systematic review synthesized the evidence for SM macrophage content and phenotype in humans and murine models of obesity, and the association of muscle macrophage content and phenotype with IR. Results were synthesized narratively, as we were unable to conduct a meta-analysis. We included 28 studies (n=10 human, n=18 murine), and all studies detected macrophage markers in SM. Macrophage content was positively associated with IR. In humans and mice, there was variability in muscle macrophage content and phenotype in obesity. Overall certainty in the evidence was low due to heterogeneity in detection methods and incompleteness of data reporting. Macrophages are detected in human and murine SM in obesity and a positive association between macrophage content and IR is noted; however, the standardization of markers, detection methods, and reporting of study details is warranted to accurately characterize macrophages and improve the potential for creating specific and targeted immune-based therapies in obesity.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assesses what is known and identify knowledge gaps for Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission patterns. METHODS: Meta-review searching the databases BioSys; Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialised Register and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; EMBASE; Google Scholar; LILACS; MEDLINE (PubMed); Web of Science; and WHOLIS with the term 'ZIKA'. Systematic reviews and reviews specifying the search methods and describing potential modes of transmission were eligible for analysis. RESULTS: Of 5,401 hits for 'Zika', 44 studies were assessed and 11 included after applying in- and exclusion criteria: six systematic reviews and five reviews with specified methods, covering all ways of possible transmission. Results can be grouped into transmission routes with good evidence and agreement between the studies (evidence on vector, mother-to-child and sexual transmission) and transmission routes with limited evidence. Transmission by breastfeeding, intrapartum, by animal bites or laboratory-based remains inconclusive, as these routes are suggested by single studies only. The risk of transfusion transmission is described and public health measures for safe transfusion should be taken as available. CONCLUSION: Our results imply the need for public health measures to limit transmission via vectors, mother-to-child, sexual transmission and blood transfusion. Also needed are long-term prospective cohort studies covering periods of active Zika virus transmission and measuring epidemiological parameters to establish evidence on other routes of transmission; seroprevalence studies; transmission dynamics modelling and modelling health impacts by different modes of transmission.},

In view of the absence of comprehensive information on the BT status in India, this study presents the seroprevalence on BT in farm animals of India based-on a systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic review was conducted to identify the published articles (2001-2018) reporting the seroprevalence of BT in sheep, goats, cattle, buffalo, camels, and Mithun (Bos frontalis) from India. From 409 research articles, 71 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and meta-analysis for proportions was carried out targeting the eligible studies. From these, 144 strata level data were extracted with a sample size of 14048 sheep, 14696 goats, 5218 cattle, 2653 buffaloes, 2062 camels, and 222 Mithun. Overall, the analyses showed that the BT seroprevalence of 43\% (95\% CI: 38-49\%) in goats, 39\% (95\% CI: 33-46\%) in sheep, 38\% (95\% CI: 25-45\%) in cattle, 34\% (95\% CI: 20-51\%) in buffaloes, 16\% (95\% CI: 10-22\%) in camels, and 66\% (95\% CI: 17-95\%) in Mithun. Furthermore, the meta-regression analysis suggested that serological tests, geographical region, and sample size were the prime moderators. Meta-analytic study indicates the BT seropositivity in 25.35 million sheep (95\% CI: 21.5-29.9), 58 million goats (95\% CI: 51.3-66.2), 66.8 million cattle (95\% CI: 47.7-86), 37.0 million buffaloes (95\% CI: 21.7-55.4), 0.06 million camels (95\% CI: 0.04-0.09), and 0.19 million Mithun (95\% CI: 0.05-0.28).

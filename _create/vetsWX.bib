	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The zoonotic potential of Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) has been debated for almost a century because of similarities between Johne's Disease (JD) in cattle and Crohn's disease (CD) in humans. Our objective was to evaluate scientific literature investigating the potential association between these two diseases (MAP and CD) and the presence of MAP in retail milk or dairy products using a qualitative systematic review. METHOD: The search strategy included 19 bibliographic databases, 8 conference proceedings, reference lists of 15 articles and contacting 28 topic-related scientists. Two independent reviewers performed relevance screening, quality assessment and data extraction stages of the review. RESULTS: Seventy-five articles were included. Among 60 case-control studies that investigated the association between MAP and CD, 37 were of acceptable quality. Twenty-three studies reported significant positive associations, 23 reported non-significant associations, and 14 did not detect MAP in any sample. Different laboratory tests, test protocols, types of samples and source populations were used in these studies resulting in large variability among studies. Seven studies investigated the association between CD and JD, two challenge trials reported contradictory results, one cross-sectional study did not support the association, and four descriptive studies suggested that isolated MAP is often closely related to cattle isolates. MAP detection in raw and pasteurized milk was reported in several studies. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for the zoonotic potential of MAP is not strong, but should not be ignored. Interdisciplinary collaboration among medical, veterinary and other public health officials may contribute to a better understanding of the potential routes of human exposure to MAP.},

	abstract = {This systematic review-meta-analysis appraises and summarizes all the available research (128 papers) on the zoonotic potential of Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis. The latter has been debated for a century due to pathogenic and clinical similarities between Johne's disease in ruminants and Crohn's disease (108 studies) in humans and recently for involvement in other human diseases; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (2), sarcoidosis (3), diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM) (7) and type 2 (3), multiple sclerosis (5) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (2). Meta-analytical results indicated a significant positive association, consistently across different laboratory methods for Crohn's disease [odds ratio (OR) range 4.26-8.44], T1DM (OR range 2.91-9.95) and multiple sclerosis (OR range 6.5-7.99). The latter two and the thyroiditis hypothesis require further investigation to confirm the association. Meta-regression of Crohn's disease studies using DNA detection methods indicated that choice of primers and sampling frame (e.g. general population vs. hospital-based sample) explained a significant proportion of heterogeneity. Other epidemiological studies demonstrated a lack of association between high-risk occupations and development of Crohn's disease. Due to knowledge gaps in understanding the role of M. paratuberculosis in the development or progression of human disease, the evidence at present is not strong enough to inform the potential public health impact of M. paratuberculosis exposure.},

	abstract = {As endemic goitre was widespread in New Zealand before the introduction of iodized salt, it was assumed that ruminants, particularly dairy cows, may benefit from iodine supplementation although clinical signs of I deficiency are rare. Several trials with sheep have not indicated any significant response in productivity to I supplements, but no definitive trials have been made with dairy cows. Estimates of pasture I concentrations are variable and requirements for lactating cows are imprecise. To ascertain the possibility of a response to I supplements, 2 literature searches, with CAB ABSTRACTS and DIALOG, were made and the procedures involved in each search are described. There were only 3 data sets in which the effect of I supplementation was studied in cows with an inadequate I intake. There was no response in terms of milk production or composition. It is suggested that, in the absence of goitrogens, pasture I less than 500 mu g/kg DM may be adequate for lactating cows but there are insufficient data on pasture or milk I in New Zealand to make an informed judgment on I status in dairy cows.},

	abstract = {Use of glyphosate-based herbicides is increasing worldwide. The authors review the available data related to potential impacts of these herbicides on amphibians and conduct a qualitative meta-analysis. Because little is known about environmental concentrations of glyphosate in amphibian habitats and virtually nothing is known about environmental concentrations of the substances added to the herbicide formulations that mainly contribute to adverse effects, glyphosate levels can only be seen as approximations for contamination with glyphosate-based herbicides. The impact on amphibians depends on the herbicide formulation, with different sensitivity of taxa and life stages. Effects on development of larvae apparently are the most sensitive endpoints to study. As with other contaminants, costressors mainly increase adverse effects. If and how glyphosate-based herbicides and other pesticides contribute to amphibian decline is not answerable yet due to missing data on how natural populations are affected. Amphibian risk assessment can only be conducted case-specifically, with consideration of the particular herbicide formulation. The authors recommend better monitoring of both amphibian populations and contamination of habitats with glyphosate-based herbicides, not just glyphosate, and suggest including amphibians in standardized test batteries to study at least dermal administration.},

The objective of this meta-analysis is to provide evidence for decision-making and further research on AI prevention through identifying the risk factors associated with AI infection on poultry farms. METHODS: The results from 15 selected studies on risk factors for AI infections on poultry farms were analyzed quantitatively by meta-analysis. RESULTS: Open water source (OR=2.89), infections on nearby farms (OR=4.54), other livestock (OR=1.90) and disinfection of farm (OR=0.54) have significant association with AI infection on poultry farms. The subgroup analysis results indicate that there exist different risk factors for AI infections in different types of farms. CONCLUSIONS: The main risk factors for AI infection in poultry farms are environmental conditions (open water source, infections on nearby farms), keeping other livestock on the same farm and no disinfection of the farm.},

This study was a systematic review of published literature. A search was conducted to identify all manuscripts relating to antibiotic treatment of cattle with respiratory disease. Relevant studies reported treatment with tulathromycin of naturally occurring respiratory disease in beef cattle in North America. Studies which failed to use randomization to minimize bias were excluded from the review. The relative risk of retreatment for bovine respiratory disease was calculated for each study included in the final review. Initially, 782 potential manuscripts were identified. After relevance screening and quality assessment, 21 high quality manuscripts were available for analysis. Two peer reviewed publications and two technical reports describing 14 trials compared tulathramycin with tilmicosin or florfenicol. In the meta-analysis of studies comparing tilmicosin with tulathromycin, the summary Mantel-Haenszel relative risk was 0.51 (95\% confidence interval 0.45-0.57). It was not possible to calculate a summary Mantel-Haenszel relative risk comparing florfenicol with tulathromycin as the only three studies reported this comparison. When using a meta-analysis to combined data from randomized clinical trials reporting treatment with tulathromycin or either florfenicol or tilmicosin, tulathromycin was associated with an approximately 50\% reduction in the risk of re-treatment for bovine respiratory disease compared with treatment with tilmicosin.},

We used meta-analysis to examine the relationship between dietary crude protein and conception rate.

MILK UREA CONCENTRATIONS AND DAIRY COW FERTILITY: The use of milk urea as an indicator of dietary energy and protein intake and as an indicator of reproductive performance has been questioned. We found that changes in urea concentration in body fluids explained only 25\% (p = 0.08) of the variance in conception rate after conducting a meta-analysis of available studies. INTERPRETATION OF MILK UREA CONCENTRATIONS: High intakes of dietary protein may induce adaptations in urea metabolism, and the negative relationship identified between high intakes of dietary protein and fertility for Northern Hemisphere dairy herds may not necessarily apply in Australasian dairy herds. Because of the potential for cows to adapt to high protein diets, the use of a single milk urea determination on a herd will have limited value as an indicator of nutritional status and little value as a predictor of fertility.},

	abstract = {The objectives of this study were to evaluate heat stress feed intake models for growing swine using a data set assembled from the literature and to develop a series of new equations modeling the influence of the thermal environment and interactions between the thermal environmental and other factors on feed intake. A literature survey was conducted to identify studies assessing intake responses to temperature. The resulting data set comprised 35 studies containing 120 comparisons to thermoneutral intake. Intake as a fraction of thermoneutral intake (FFI) was the primary response variable, where a value of 1 represented no change from thermoneutral intake. The FFI predicted by NRC and a recent model from a meta-analysis (Renaudeau et al.,) were compared to observed values. New parameters for the NRC equation (NRCmod) were derived, and a series of new equations incorporating duration of exposure (TD), temperature cycling (TC), and floor type (TH) were also derived. Root-mean-square prediction error (RMSPE) and concordance correlation coefficients were used to evaluate all models. The RMSPE for the NRC model was 23.6 with mean and slope bias accounting for 12.6\% and 51.1\% of prediction error, respectively. The TD, TC, and TH models had reduced RMSPE compared with NRC: 12.9 for TD, 12.6 for TC, and 12.9 for TS. Substantial improvements were also made by refitting parameters (NRCmod; RMSPE 13.0\%). In NRCmod, TD, TC, and TH, random error was the predominant source, accounting for over 97\% of prediction error. The Renaudeau et al. model was also evaluated. Renaudeau et al. had relatively low RMSPE (22.3) for intake but higher RMSPE for FFI (22.6) than NRC, NRCmod, TD, TC, or TH. Additional parameters were derived for the Renaudeau et al. equation to account for housing system and diet characteristics. This adjustment reduced RMSPE of predicting feed intake (16.0) and FFI (16.3) and reduced systematic bias in the equation. This evaluation of equations highlights the effects of novel explanatory variables on feed intake during heat stress, and the comparison can be useful when selecting a model that best explains variability in feed intake responses to heat stress given available input data.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To systematically review clinical and preclinical data on hydroxyethyl starch (HES) tissue storage. METHODS: MEDLINE (PubMed) was searched and abstracts were screened using defined criteria to identify articles containing original data on HES tissue accumulation. RESULTS: Forty-eight studies were included: 37 human studies with a total of 635 patients and 11 animal studies. The most frequent indication for fluid infusion was surgery accounting for 282 patients (45.9\%). HES localization in skin was shown by 17 studies, in kidney by 12, in liver by 8, and in bone marrow by 5. Additional sites of HES deposition were lymph nodes, spleen, lung, pancreas, intestine, muscle, trophoblast, and placental stroma. Among major organs the highest measured tissue concentration of HES was in the kidney. HES uptake into intracellular vacuoles was observed by 30 min after infusion. Storage was cumulative, increasing in proportion to dose, although in 15\% of patients storage and associated symptoms were demonstrated at the lowest cumulative doses (0.4 g kg(-1)). Some HES deposits were extremely long-lasting, persisting for 8 years or more in skin and 10 years in kidney. Pruritus associated with HES storage was described in 17 studies and renal dysfunction in ten studies. In one included randomized trial, HES infusion produced osmotic nephrosis-like lesions indicative of HES storage (p = 0.01) and also increased the need for renal replacement therapy (odds ratio, 9.50; 95\% confidence interval, 1.09-82.7; p = 0.02). The tissue distribution of HES was generally similar in animals and humans. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue storage of HES is widespread, rapid, cumulative, frequently long-lasting, and potentially harmful.},

This review of data compares the performance effects (ADG, G:F, DMI) of technologies used in conventional feeding programs that are prohibited in organic programs, natural programs, or both. The technologies evaluated were steroid implants, monensin, tylosin, endectocides, and metaphylaxis with any antimicrobial. For inclusion in this analysis, studies were conducted in North America, reported randomization to treatment group, used beef cattle, contained an untreated control group, and were sourced from peer-reviewed journals. Forest plots were used to examine the data visually for trends toward a uniform effect of the technology on the outcomes of interest (ADG, DMI, G:F). Technologies that displayed a uniform response on the forest plot compared with negative controls were then analyzed using mixed models. Examination of forest plots for endectocides, steroid implants, monensin, and metaphylaxis technologies appeared to show performance advantages for treated cattle relative to cattle in negative control groups. An insufficient number of studies met the inclusion criteria to conduct meta-analyses comparing endectocides, monensin, or tylosin with negative controls. Average daily gain in feeder cattle given metaphylaxis on arrival was 0.11 kg/d (P {\textless} 0.01) greater relative to cattle that did not receive metaphylaxis on arrival. Implanting heifers increased ADG by 0.08 kg/d compared with nonimplanted controls (P = 0.09). Implants had no effect on G:F (P = 0.14) in heifers or on DMI (P = 0.44) relative to nonimplanted control heifers. Implanting steers was associated with greater ADG, by 0.25 kg/d (P {\textless} 0.01), and DMI, by 0.53 kg/d (P {\textless} 0.01), relative to nonimplanted control steers. Implants also improved G:F in steers relative to nonimplanted steers, by 0.02 (0.17 vs. 0.15; implanted vs. controls, P {\textless} 0.01; n = 21 studies). When average estimated differences in ADG and G:F for implanted and nonimplanted steers were incorporated into a breakeven model, implanted steers had a \$77/animal lower cost of production than nonimplanted steers and a \$349/animal lower cost of production than organically raised steers. These data illustrate the importance of capturing premiums when operating natural and organic production systems to maintain economic viability.},

Our objective was to identify, assess, and summarize or synthesize the published research investigating the effect of HACCP programs on microbial prevalence and concentration on food animal carcasses in abattoirs through primary processing. The results of microbial testing pre- and post-HACCP implementation were reported in only 19 studies, mostly investigating beef (n=13 studies) and pork (n=8 studies) carcasses. In 12 of 13 studies measuring aerobic bacterial counts, reductions were reported on beef (7/8 studies), pork (3/3), poultry (1/1), and sheep (1/1). Significant (p{\textless}0.05) reductions in prevalence of Salmonella spp. were reported in studies on pork (2/3 studies) and poultry carcasses (3/3); no significant reductions were reported on beef carcasses (0/8 studies). These trends were confirmed through meta-analysis of these data; however, powerful meta-analysis was precluded because of an overall scarcity of individual studies and significant heterogeneity across studies. Australia reported extensive national data spanning the period from 4 years prior to HACCP implementation to 4 years post-HACCP, indicating reduction in microbial prevalence and concentration on beef carcasses in abattoirs slaughtering beef for export; however, the effect of abattoir changes initiated independent of HACCP could not be excluded. More primary research and access to relevant proprietary data are needed to properly evaluate HACCP program effectiveness using modeling techniques capable of differentiating the effects of HACCP from other concurrent factors.},

	abstract = {Five on-farm practices for reduction of Salmonella shedding or sero-prevalence in grow-finish swine were selected through scoping study and expert consultation. Specific examples were selected based on supporting evidence from at least one controlled trial (CT), and availability to Canadian swine producers. Efficacy was evaluated using systematic review and meta-analysis (SR-MA) methodology. A modified Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was applied to assess the quality of evidence for each intervention, and a 'summary of findings' table was developed to present findings 'at-a-glance'. MA of the small dataset of CTs investigating feeding meal, and measuring serology, yielded a significant summary estimate of efficacy (odds ratio (OR)=0.21; 95\% confidence intervals (CI): 0.14, 0.31) with non-significant heterogeneity (P{\textgreater}0.10). MA of the dataset investigating inclusion of organic acids in the ration, measuring serology, yielded a significant summary estimate with significant heterogeneity across studies (P{\textless}0.001, I(2)=91\%) precluding presentation of a single summary estimate; a range of results were reported (OR Range: 28 (1.6, 498); 0.07 (CI: 0.042, 0.33)). Pen disinfection between batches of finishers was studied in one large CT measuring both fecal culture (OR 0.84 (0.68, 1.1)) and serology (OR 0.48 (0.40, 0.58)) outcomes. The dataset investigating Salmonella spp. vaccination contained inconsistent findings (OR Range: 4.5 (1.3, 15); 0.07 (0.008, 0.68)), with significant heterogeneity across studies (P=0.005, I(2)=82), assessed measuring fecal culture. MA of the dataset investigating inclusion of in-feed tetracyclines yielded a significant OR indicating a potential harmful effect, measuring fecal culture, (OR Range: 14 (1.9, 108); 1.0 (0.43, 2.5)) with significant heterogeneity (P=0.003, I(2)=82\%) across studies, suggesting some potential for withdrawal of in-feed tetracyclines to reduce Salmonella shedding. Therefore our ranking of intervention efficacy is: feeding meal{\textgreater}inclusion of acids in ration, feeder pen disinfection or Salmonella spp. vaccination{\textgreater}in-feed tetrayclines. Study design characteristics increasing risk of bias, including failure to justify sample size (19 of 31 studies) and failure to report random or systematic sampling (13 of 31 studies), resulted in modified GRADE evidence rankings of 'low' for these interventions. This suggests that further research is likely to affect our findings. Field CTs investigating herd-level interventions with measurements at the herd- and individual-levels are recommended. Overall, SR-MA was a useful approach for ranking efficacy, and GRADE offered a transparent method for ranking quality of evidence, although both were limited by the small number of comparable studies available.},

Among 47 studies included in the review, 32 comparison studies were suitable for quality assessment. Fifteen studies were not assessed for quality, due to their descriptive nature or a low sample size (n {\textless}or= 2 farms). Overall, bacterial outcomes were reported in 17 studies, and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and multidrug resistance (MDR) of zoonotic or potentially zoonotic bacteria in 12 and 7 studies, respectively. Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli including Shiga toxin-producing strains, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and SCC were investigated in 2, 7, 4, 6, and 15 studies, respectively. Contradictory findings were reported for differences in bacterial outcomes and SCC between dairy production types (organic vs. conventional). Lower prevalence of AMR on organic dairy farms was reported more consistently in studies conducted in the United States, as opposed to those conducted in Europe. These conflicting findings may result from geographic differences in organic production regulations governing antimicrobial usage, use of antimicrobials in conventional dairy production, and baseline prevalence, as well as laboratory methods, study designs, or methods of analysis employed. The majority (four of seven) of MDR investigations reported no significant differences in prevalence. Overall, only 9 of 32 studies met all five methodological soundness criteria. More well designed, executed, and reported primary research is needed at the farm and post-farm levels.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of bacterial culture and PCR for Salmonella in swine was examined through systematic review of existing primary research in this field. A replicable search was conducted in 10 electronic databases. All steps of the review were conducted by two reviewers: to identify relevant publications, to assess their methodological soundness and reporting, and to extract raw data or reported test accuracy estimates. Meta-analyses and meta-regression were performed: to evaluate pooled estimates of test sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp), to identify variables explaining the variation in reported test estimates, and to evaluate the association between these variables and reported test Se and Sp. Twenty-nine studies were included in the review. Unique test evaluations reported in these 29 studies were categorized according to the type of test comparison: culture versus culture (n = 134 test evaluations) and PCR versus culture (n = 21). We identified significant heterogeneity among evaluations for each test category. For culture, more heterogeneity was caused by differences in individual test protocols (52\%) than overall differences between studies (16\%). Enrichment temperature, study population, agar and enrichment type were significantly associated with variation in culture Se. Furthermore, interaction between enrichment temperature and enrichment type was detected. For PCR, most of the heterogeneity was caused by overall differences between studies (65-70\%); sample type and study size were associated with variation in reported PCR Se and Sp. The overall methodological soundness and/or reporting of primary studies included in this review were poor, with variable use of reference standards, and consistent lack of the use or reporting of blinding, randomization and subject (sample) selection criteria. Consequently, the food safety and veterinary public health research community should formally consider ways for standardizing the conduct and reporting of this type of research.},

DATABASES USED: Four sources were used to identify manuscripts for review. Databases searched were those of the National Library of Medicine, EMBASE and CAB International. In addition, pertinent references in the bibliographies of included articles were retrieved. RESULTS: Twenty manuscripts published in refereed journals were reviewed. These included papers reporting 18 clinical trials and two studies conducted in conditioned research cats. Twelve analgesics were evaluated, including seven opioids, four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and one local anesthetic. Nine studies involved a direct comparison of analgesic agents. Limb use was abnormal when measured at 2 and 12 days following onychectomy, and neither fentanyl patch nor butorphanol administration resulted in normal use of the surgical limb. In another study, cats evaluated at 6 months after this surgery were not lame. Differing surgical techniques were compared in six studies; the results indicated that pain scores were lower after laser surgery than after scalpel surgery. The difficulties associated with assessing pain in cats and the lack of sensitivity of the evaluation systems utilized were highlighted in many of the studies. Huge variations in dose and dosing strategies had significant impacts on drug efficacy. Statistically significant differences among treatments were found in most studies; however, no clearly superior analgesic treatment was identified. A combination of meloxicam or robenacoxib with an opioid may provide more effective analgesia and should be evaluated.},

All of the studies reviewed had research design quality concerns including small participant sizes, poor descriptions of the interventions, outcome measures with minimal psychometrics and lack of power calculations. Findings indicated three major themes including social/participation, functional and psychological outcomes; all of which are areas in the occupational therapy scope of practice. Occupational therapists may play a critical role in referral, assessment, assisting clients and consulting with training organizations before, during and after the service dog placement process. In order for health care professionals to have confidence in recommending this type of assistive technology, the evidence to support such decisions must be strengthened.},

	abstract = {Reducing zoonotic pathogens in food animals prior to harvest will reduce the pathogen burden that enters the food chain and the environment. Consequently, the burden of enteric illness in humans may be reduced. Evaluating interventions to reduce a pathogen in animals often begins with challenge trials, in which animals are deliberately exposed to the pathogen under controlled conditions. Challenge trials are subsequently followed by field trials, also known as randomized controlled trials, in which the animals are naturally exposed to the pathogen. Challenge trials can most effectively inform field trials only if they precede field trials, are robust, internally valid and transparently reported. Using systematic review and meta-analysis methodology, we examined the pre-harvest food safety literature for three intervention-pathogen-species combinations: probiotics/competitive exclusion products in ruminants to reduce Escherichia coli O157 shedding, vaccines in ruminants to reduce E. coli O157 shedding and vaccines in swine to reduce Salmonella shedding. We examined two outcomes, prevalence of faecal shedding at the end of the trial and prevalence of faecal shedding throughout the trial period, to compare challenge trials and field trials. We found that challenge trials occurred concurrently with field trials, challenge trials suffered from reporting deficiencies of methodological features, challenge trials tended to report a more favourable outcome than field trials, and there was some evidence of publication bias among all three intervention-pathogen-species combinations. Challenge trials would better serve to inform field trials if they precede field trials, are methodologically sound, include transparent reporting and are published regardless of their results. In addition, due to our findings of greater efficacy reported among challenge trials compared with field trials, risk models predicting the public health benefits of pre-harvest interventions to reduce zoonotic pathogens in livestock might be best served by field trial results alone.},

Infection occurs through direct contact with infected animals or their faeces, through contaminated food or water and/or through person-to-person transmission. A reduction in faecal E. coli O157 shedding in cattle might reduce the burden of human infections. We used systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of direct-fed microbials (DFM), compared with placebo or no treatment, fed during the pre-harvest stage of production in reducing faecal E. coli O157 shedding in beef cattle during field trials. Four electronic databases, Nebraska Beef Reports and review article reference lists were searched. A total of 16 publications assessing faecal shedding at the end of the trial and/or throughout the trial period were included. The majority of publicly disseminated trials evaluated the prevalence of E. coli O157 faecal shedding; only two evaluated the concentration of organisms in faeces. The prevalence of faecal E. coli O157 shedding in cattle is significantly reduced by DFM treatments (summary effect size for all DFM – OR = 0.46; CI = 0.36-0.60). The DFM combination Lactobacillus acidophilus (NP51) and Propionibacterium freudenreichii (NP24) was more efficacious in reducing the prevalence of faecal E. coli O157 shedding at the time of harvest and throughout the trial period compared with the group of other DFM, although this difference was not statistically significant. Furthermore, we found that the combination [NP51 and NP24] treatment was more efficacious in reducing the prevalence of faecal E. coli O157 shedding at the time of harvest and throughout the trial period when fed at the dose of 109 CFU/animal/day than any lesser amount, although this difference was not statistically significant. Feeding beef cattle DFM during the pre-harvest stage of production reduces the prevalence of E. coli O157 faecal shedding and might effectively reduce human infections.},

	abstract = {Although frequently examined as a target organ for non-endocrine toxicity, histopathological evaluation of the liver is becoming a routine component of endocrine disruption studies that utilize various fish species as test subjects. However, the interpretation of microscopic liver findings can be challenging, especially when attempting to distinguish adverse changes associated with endocrine disrupting substances from those caused by systemic or direct hepatic toxicity. The purpose of this project was to conduct a critical assessment of the available peer-reviewed and grey literature concerning the histopathologic effects of reproductive endocrine active substances (EAS) and non-endocrine acting substances in the livers of fish models, and to determine if liver histopathology can be used to reliably distinguish endocrine from non-endocrine etiologies. The results of this review suggest that few compound-specific histopathologic liver effects have been identified, among which are estrogen agonist-induced increases in hepatocyte basophilia and proteinaceous intravascular fluid in adult male teleosts, and potentially, decreased hepatocyte basophilia in female fish exposed to substances that possess androgenic, anti-estrogenic, or aromatase inhibitory activity. This review also used published standardized methodology to assess the credibility of the histopathology data in each of the 117 articles that reported liver effects of treatment, and consequently it was determined that in only 37\% of those papers were the data considered either highly credible or credible. The outcome of this work highlights the value of histopathologic liver evaluation as an investigative tool for EAS studies, and provides information that may have implications for EAS hazard assessment.},

This review evaluates the available literature regarding BRD confirmatory diagnostic tests, early detection methods, and modalities to estimate post-therapeutic prognosis or predict unfavorable or fatal outcomes. Scientific evidence promotes the use of haptoglobin to confirm BRD status. Feeding behavior, infrared thermography, and reticulorumen boluses are promising methods. Retrospective analyses of routinely collected treatment and cohort data can be used to identify cattle at risk of unfavorable outcome. Other methods have been reviewed but require further study.},

	abstract = {Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is an important zoonotic disease; however, the efficacy of available vaccines for the prevention of naturally-occurring Leishmania infantum (L. infantum) infection in dogs remains unclear. The objective of this review was to determine the efficacy of currently available vaccines to prevent naturally-occurring L. infantum infection in dogs. Four bibliographic databases (CAB Direct 2011, Web of Science 2011, U.S. National Library of Medicine 2011 and Literatura Latino Americana e do Caribe em Ciencias da Saude) were searched along with eight sets of conference proceedings and the International Veterinary Information Service (IVIS) database, from 1980 to November 2012. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised clinical trials (NRCTs), cohort studies and case-control studies that investigated vaccine efficacy for natural L. infantum infection in dogs were eligible for inclusion. Two review authors independently assessed each study against the inclusion criteria, independently extracted relevant data from all included studies and assessed the risk of methodological shortcomings in each individual study. The odds ratio (OR) and absolute risk reduction (ARR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference for continuous outcomes were calculated. Meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity of the studies identified. The search was conducted for all mitigations for CanL and yielded the title and abstract of 937 articles, from which 84 articles were screened based on full text. Twelve studies on vaccinations (five RCTs, seven NRCTs) were identified. Ten studies were at a high risk of methodological shortcomings, whilst two were at an unclear risk. The use of 200mug ALM protein, Leishmune(R), CaniLeish(R), LiESAp with MDP, and ALM with BCG tended to significantly reduce the proportion of dogs infected with L. infantum based on either parasitological or serological evidence. The use of lyophilized protein vaccine significantly increased the proportion of dogs infected with L. infantum based on either parasitological or serological evidence. There is peer-reviewed evidence that control measures are effective in preventing CanL with the results suggesting that between 6 and 54\% of infections could be prevented with vaccination. However, this evidence is based on a small number of RCTs, all of which are either at high or unclear risk of methodological shortcomings. Well-designed, adequately powered and properly reported randomised clinical trials are needed to clearly establish efficacy of vaccines as CanL control measures.},

Information was extracted using predefined data fields, including 18 study quality indicators. In total, 17 publications were fully appraised. Six were considered to provide the most reliable information about risk factors for naturally-occurring laminitis. Information on signalment was well researched and there was good evidence for an association with chronic laminitis and increasing age. There remain inconsistent results for many other horse-level risk factors including gender, breed and bodyweight. Previous publications estimating risk factors for equine laminitis were of reasonable quality, although they were limited in the number and scope of the risk factors studied. High-quality, evidence-based studies are needed to identify further risk factors and to establish consensus over previously identified risk factors for different equine populations.},

Ten were considered to provide the most reliable information, estimating the frequency of equine laminitis ranging from 1.5\% to 34\%. Previous publications estimating laminitis frequency were generally poor quality. Laminitis frequency varied across publications however the publications included in this review focussed on many of the different underlying laminitis aetiologies and comparison of the frequencies between groups would be inappropriate.

	abstract = {Meat and meat products are the main vehicles of foodborne diseases in humans caused by pathogens such as Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) and Staphylococcus aureus. In order to prioritise research on those microbial hazards, a meta-analysis study was conducted to summarise available information on the presence of such pathogens in meats produced in Portugal. By using a logit-transformed proportion as effect size parameterisation, a number of multilevel random-effect meta-analysis models were fitted to estimate mean occurrence rates of pathogens, and to compare them among meat categories (i.e., bovine meat, broiler meat, pork, minced beef and minced pork), and among meat product categories (i.e., intended to be eaten cooked, to be eaten raw and cured meats). The mean occurrence rate of Campylobacter in Portuguese broiler meat (40\%; 95\% CI: 22.0-61.4\%) was about ten times higher than that of Salmonella (4.0\%; 95\% CI: 1.4-10.8\%); although these levels were comparable to current EU ranges. Nevertheless, in the other meat categories, the meta-analysed incidences of Salmonella were slightly to moderately higher than EU averages. A semi-quantitative risk ranking of pathogens in Portuguese-produced pork pointed Salmonella spp. as critical (with a mean occurrence of 12.6\%; 95\% CI: 8.0-19.3\%), and Y. enterocolitica as high (6.8\%; 95\% CI: 2.2-19.3\%). In the case of the Portuguese meat products, the non-compliance to EU microbiological criteria for L. monocytogenes (8.8\%; 95\% CI: 6.5-11.8\%) and Salmonella spp. (9.7\%; 95\% CI: 7.0-13.4\%) at sample units level, in the categories 'intended to be eaten cooked' and 'to be eaten raw', were considerably higher than EU levels for ready-to-eat products in comparable categories. S. aureus was the pathogen of greatest concern given its high occurrence (22.6\%; 95\% CI: 15.4-31.8\%) in meat products. These results emphasised the necessity of Portuguese food safety agencies to take monitoring, and training actions for the maintenance of good hygiene practices during the production of the great variety of traditional meat products. This meta-analysis study also highlighted important gaps of knowledge, and may assist food safety authorities in the prioritisation of microbiological hazards, and the implementation of essential food safety assurance systems at primary production.},

We report on the first use of meta-analysis and a systematic review to analyze the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in companion animals. Databases such as MedLib, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched. The information was extracted by two independent reviewers and the results were reviewed by a third. Two reviewers independently assessed the study protocol using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist and the study quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist for prevalence data. OpenMeta analyst and comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) were used for the meta-analysis. The random effect model was used, and publication bias was assessed using the Eggers test and funnel plot. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed, and the sources were analyzed using the leave-one-out meta-analysis, subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Twenty-two studies met the eligibility criteria, but because some studies reported the prevalence of VRE in more than one companion animal, they were considered as individual studies, and 35 studies were therefore added to the final meta-analysis. Sampling period of the included studies was from 1995-2018. Of the 4288 isolates tested in the included studies, 1241 were VRE. The pooled prevalence of VRE in companion animals was estimated at 14.6\% (95\% CI; 8.7-23.5\%; I(2) = 97.10\%; p {\textless} 0.001). Between-study variability was high (t(2) = 2.859; heterogeneity I(2) = 97.10\% with heterogeneity chi-square (Q) = 1173.346, degrees of freedom (df) = 34, and p {\textless} 0.001). The funnel plot showed bias, which was confirmed by Eggers test (t-value = 3.97165; p = 0.00036), and estimates from the leave-one-out forest plot did not affect the pooled prevalence. Pooled prevalence of VRE in dogs and cats were 18.2\% (CI = 9.4-32.5\%) and 12.3\%, CI = 3.8-33.1\%), respectively. More studies were reported in Europe than in any other continent, with most studies using feces as the sample type and disc diffusion as the detection method.

	abstract = {A number of prion diseases affect humans, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; most of these are due to genetic mutations in the affected individual and occur sporadically, but some result from transmission of prion proteins from external sources. Of the known animal prion diseases, only bovine spongiform encephalopathy prions have been shown to be transmissible from animals to humans under non-experimental conditions. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease that affects cervids (e.g., deer and elk) in North America and isolated populations in Korea and Europe. Systematic review methodology was used to identify, select, critically appraise and analyse data from relevant research. Studies were evaluated for adherence to good conduct based on their study design following the Cochrane collaboration's approach to grading the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations (GRADE). Twenty-three studies were included after screening 800 citations from the literature search and evaluating 78 full papers. Studies examined the transmissibility of CWD prions to humans using epidemiological study design, in vitro and in vivo experiments. Five epidemiological studies, two studies on macaques and seven studies on humanized transgenic mice provided no evidence to support the possibility of transmission of CWD prions to humans. Ongoing surveillance in the United States and Canada has not documented CWD transmission to humans. However, two studies on squirrel monkeys provided evidence that transmission of CWD prions resulting in prion disease is possible in these monkeys under experimental conditions and seven in vitro experiments provided evidence that CWD prions can convert human prion protein to a misfolded state. Therefore, future discovery of CWD transmission to humans cannot be entirely ruled out on the basis of current studies, particularly in the light of possible decades-long incubation periods for CWD prions in humans. It would be prudent to continue CWD research and epidemiologic surveillance, exercise caution when handling potentially contaminated material and explore CWD management opportunities.},

All the documents (case studies, review articles, systematic reviews, meta-analysis, case control studies, cohort studies, randomised control trials, and longitudinal studies) were included in the study. The articles mainly cover different areas such as epidemiology, prevalence, diagnosis, pathogenesis, clinical outcomes, molecular basis, phylogenetics, transmission and treatment of CCHF. Treatment and prevention related knowledge is limited; therefore, future research should focus the development of therapeutics to mitigate the increasing risk of CCHF. Priority future goal should be studies on the molecular basis and treatment of CCHFV infection because several knowledge gaps have been identified in these areas.},

DESIGN: A comprehensive literature search and meta-analysis were conducted in which 22 studies (13 child, 9 adult) met inclusion criteria. Both intervention versus control and intervention pre-post effect sizes were computed using a random effects model. RESULTS: The overall intervention versus control effect size was large and significant (d = 1.65, 95\% CI = 0.46-2.832). Similarly, the pre-post effect size was large and significant (d = 2.19, 95\% CI = 0.74-3.64). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis indicate that AAI can yield large effects across a number of medically relevant outcomes. There is, however, substantial methodological variation across studies and more randomized clinical trials with stronger methodological controls are needed to establish the effectiveness of AAI compared to other interventions.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.envint.2017.12.032},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: An increasing number of reports suggest early life exposures result in adverse effects in offspring who were never directly exposed; this phenomenon is termed "transgenerational inheritance." Given concern for public health implications for potential effects of exposures transmitted to subsequent generations, it is critical to determine how widespread and robust this phenomenon is and to identify the range of exposures and possible outcomes. OBJECTIVES: This scoping report examines the evidence for transgenerational inheritance associated with exposure to a wide range of stressors in humans and animals to identify areas of consistency, uncertainty, data gaps, and to evaluate general risk of bias issues for the transgenerational study design. METHODS: A protocol was developed to collect and categorize the literature into a systematic evidence map for transgenerational inheritance by health effects, exposures, and evidence streams following the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) approach for conducting literature-based health assessments. RESULTS: A PubMed search yielded 63,758 unique records from which 257 relevant studies were identified and categorized into a systematic evidence map by evidence streams (46 human and 211 animal), broad health effect categories, and exposures. Data extracted from the individual studies are available in the Health Assessment Workspace Collaborative (HAWC) program. There are relatively few bodies of evidence where multiple studies evaluated the same exposure and the same or similar outcomes. Studies evaluated for risk of bias generally had multiple issues in design or conduct. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence mapping illustrated that risk of bias, few studies, and heterogeneity in exposures and endpoints examined present serious limitations to available bodies of evidence for assessing transgenerational effects. Targeted research is suggested to addressed inconsistencies and risk of bias issues identified, and thereby establish more robust bodies of evidence to critically assess transgenerational effects - particularly by adding data on exposure-outcome pairs where there is some evidence (i.e., reproductive, metabolic, and neurological effects).},

	abstract = {Severe hyperthermia, for example, classical heatstroke or exertional heatstroke from heatwaves or exercise respectively, or from drug ingestion or other non-infective pyrogens, is associated with a high mortality and morbidity, which may be chronic or permanent. Abolition of lipopolysaccharide, from gram-negative intestinal bacteria translocating into the systemic circulation via an intestinal wall rendered permeable from the hyperthermia, reduces the adverse effects, suggesting that antibiotics against the intestinal bacteria may have a similar effect. A systematic review searching Embase, MEDLINE and PubMed from the earliest date available until 2019 was conducted, according to PRISMA guidelines. Two papers were found which fit the criteria. In one, non-absorbable oral antibiotics were administered prior to the onset of heat stress, which reduced the cardiovascular dysfunction and rise in endotoxaemia, but animals succumbed at a lower temperature. In the second, non-absorbable oral antibiotics, in combination with a laxative and enema, given prior to the onset of heat stress, improved mortality; antibiotics administered after the heat stress did not, but the antibiotics used may have limited action against intestinal bacteria. Only two papers were found; both suggest an improvement in organ dysfunction or mortality after an episode of heat stress. No papers were found that investigate the sole use of antibiotics effective against intestinal bacteria given after the onset of heat stress, although biological plausibility suggest they warrant further research.},

Nonetheless, these data are highly fragmented, and a tool is required to integrate existing data and to provide a basis for data-driven decision making for IFM's safety. Therefore, meta-analysis and meta-regression were conducted to estimate the prevalence of foodborne pathogens in IFM and to determine factors influencing the estimated values. Using Africa as a case, searches were systematically made for published data and relevant grey literature. Data from 18 studies in 15 countries were analyzed. Staphylococcus aureus (37\%), pathogenic Escherichia coli (16\%), Listeria monocytogenes (6\%), and Salmonella spp. (3\%) were the most prevalent pathogens with a pooled prevalence estimate of 12\%. Heterogeneity among prevalence estimates was attributed to sampling point and microbial group but could be moderated by publication year, country cluster, and methods for microbial confirmation. The pooled prevalence estimates increased over time as more studies became available, whereby the odds were higher in studies from 2010 onwards than studies before 2010. From the analyses, S. aureus presented the greatest safety concern in African IFM. Future microbiological studies should take into consideration different IFM sampling points and advanced analytical methods to identify pathogens.},

	abstract = {Rabies is one of the major public health problems in China, and the mortality rate of rabies remains the highest among all notifiable infectious diseases. A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) vaccination rate and risk factors for human rabies in mainland China. The PubMed, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Science and Technology Periodical and Wanfang databases were searched for articles on rabies vaccination status (published between 2007 and 2017). In total, 10 174 human rabies cases from 136 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Approximately 97.2\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 95.1-98.7\%) of rabies cases occurred in rural areas and 72.6\% (95\% CI 70.0-75.1\%) occurred in farmers. Overall, the vaccination rate in the reported human rabies cases was 15.4\% (95\% CI 13.7-17.4\%). However, among vaccinated individuals, 85.5\% (95\% CI 79.8\%-83.4\%) did not complete the vaccination regimen. In a subgroup analysis, the PEP vaccination rate in the eastern region (18.8\%, 95\% CI 15.9-22.1\%) was higher than that in the western region (13.3\%, 95\% CI 11.1-15.8\%) and this rate decreased after 2007. Approximately 68.9\% (95\% CI 63.6-73.8\%) of rabies cases experienced category-III exposures, but their PEP vaccination rate was 27.0\% (95\% CI 14.4-44.9\%) and only 6.1\% (95\% CI 4.4-8.4\%) received rabies immunoglobulin. Together, these results suggested that the PEP vaccination rate among human rabies cases was low in mainland China. Therefore, standardised treatment and vaccination programs of dog bites need to be further strengthened, particularly in rural areas.},

Studies reporting serological evidence of A. phagocytophilum infection in humans were included, and the information was extracted by two authors independently. As the study heterogeneity was significant, a random-effects model was used to calculate the overall pooled seroprevalence.

The overall pooled A. phagocytophilum seroprevalence in humans was 8.4\% (95\% CI: 6.6\%-10.4\%).

A search strategy was applied to eight databases from inception to June 2020. The CAMARADES 10-item quality checklist and Rev-Man 5.3 software were used to analyze the risks of bias of each study and data regarding outcome measures, respectively. The mean study quality score was 5.4 points (range 3-8 points). Meta-analyses data and comparisons between groups showed that AS-IV significantly slowed the progression of pathological signs in the kidney including glomeruli and tubules, increasing creatinine clearance rate, decreasing blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, 24-h urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase, 24-h urinary albumin, 24-h urinary microalbumin and HbA1c. There were no significant differences between experimental and control groups with respect to mortality or levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. In terms of the possible mechanisms of treatment of DN, AS-IV acts through antifibrotic, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic mechanisms, thereby alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress, inhibiting mitochondrial fission, and increasing autophagic activity. Taken together, our findings suggest that AS-IV is a multifaceted renoprotective candidate drug for DN.},

Six published articles containing 1378 cattle samples were included in our meta-analysis. We found UASMS2 was not related to carcass weight, dressing percentage and loin muscle area in the recessive genetic model, but there was a significant association between UASMS2 and average daily weight gain, dry matter intake, body weight, marbling score, and backfat thickness. This meta-analysis indicated that UASMS2 was associated with growth and meat quality traits of cattle, implying that this SNP can be used reliably in beef cattle breeding.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the conversion of serum antibodies against Schistosoma japonicum in humans and livestock detected by immunological tests following treatment with praziquantel. METHODS: The studies pertaining to serological tests of schistosomiasis japonica published from 1991 to 2020 were retrieved in electronic databases, including Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang Data, PubMed and ScienceDirect. Data were extracted from included studies. The publication bias was assessed with funnel plots using the software RevMan version 5.3, and the conversion of antibodies against S. japonicum was evaluated through meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 40 publications were included in the final meta-analysis, consisting of 33 Chinese publications and 7 English publications, and all immunological tests were performed with indirect hemagglutination test (IHA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Pooled analysis showed that the negative rates of serum anti-S. japonicum antibody were 45.36\% [95\% confidential interval (CI): (43.96\%, 46.76\%)] and 20.83\% [95\% CI: (19.69\%, 21.97\%)] detected by ELISA and IHA within 6 months post praziquantel treatment, 62.95\% [95\% CI: (61.59\%, 64.31\%)] and 55.61\% [95\% CI: (54.21\%, 57.01\%)] within 6 to 12 months after treatment and 85.92\% [95\% CI: (84.94\%, 86.90\%)] and 86.90\% [95\% CI: (85.95\%, 87.85\%)] over 12 months after treatment, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The negative rate of the serum anti-S. japonicum antibody by IHA and ELISA increased with the time of post-treatment with praziquantel. The overall negative rates of anti-S. japonicum antibody detected by IHA and ELISA are low within 12 months post praziquantel treatment. However, a high negative rate of anti-S. japonicum antibody is detected if there is no new contact with infested water after 12 months of praziquantel treatment.},

We aimed to conduct a systematic review on the studies using the TUS to modulate the brain functions and associated behavioral changes in both animals and humans. Methods: A literature search for published studies in the past 10 years was conducted. Two authors independently reviewed the relevant articles. Data were extracted and qualitatively summarized. Quality of studies was assessed by the SYRCLE's risk of bias tool for preclinical studies or the PEDro scale for clinical studies. Results: A total of 24 animal studies (506 animals) and 11 human studies (213 subjects) were included. Findings based on most animal studies demonstrated the excitatory or suppressive modulatory effects of ultrasonic stimulations on motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, thalamus, prefrontal cortex, auditory, and visual areas. Brain modulatory effects also were found among healthy human subjects in seven studies and two clinical studies suggested TUS may result in potential benefits on patients with disorder of consciousness or chronic pain. The safety concerns of TUS seem to be minor based on the human studies. Conclusions: TUS appears to be a viable technique in modulating the brain functions; however, research on TUS is still in its early stages, especially in human studies. Parameters need to be optimized before launching systematic investigations in humans.},

	abstract = {Neuropathic pain is defined as a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system, currently remaining a challenging condition to treat. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation is emerging as a promising strategy to alleviate the neuropathic pain conditions induced by peripheral nerve injury. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy and safety of MSCs transplantation in neuropathic pain induced by peripheral nerve injury in controlled animal studies, and thus to yield evidence-based decision making. Following the PRISMA guidelines, PubMed, Cochrane Central Library, Embase, and CINAHL were searched for preclinical controlled animal studies from the inception to April 16, 2020. Seventeen studies are included in this review. Substantial heterogeneity is observed regarding the animal's species, models of neuropathic pain, regimen of MSCs transplantation, and outcome of measures across the included studies. Both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia could be significantly attenuated by transplanted MSCs. The MSCs-elicited analgesic effect is independent of the type of MSCs, time of administration, and route of delivery, and is efficiently enhanced by genetic transfection with fibroblast growth factor, proenkephalin, and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. The migration of MSCs after intrathecal or intravenous injection has been shown to be directed toward the surface of dorsal spinal cord or dorsal root ganglions on the ipsilateral side of injury. No adverse effects have been reported. The accumulating evidence demonstrates the therapeutic effect of MSCs-based cell therapy on prevention and alleviation of the neuropathic pain induced by peripheral nerve injury in rat or mouse models. The robust preclinical studies are deserved to optimize the regimen of MSCs transplantation and to promote the translation of the MSCs-based therapy into clinical studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Animal models are well established for studying the effects of alkaloids in preventing myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, few studies have investigated the therapeutic effects of alkaloids in humans. This meta-analysis and systematic review assessed the efficacy of alkaloids in attenuating infarct size in rats with myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. METHODS: An integrated literature search including the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases was performed to identify studies that evaluated the therapeutic effects of alkaloids on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats. The main outcome was infarct size, and SYRCLE's risk of bias tool was used to assess the quality of the studies. RESULTS: 22 studies were brought into the meta-analysis. Compared with the effects of vehicle, alkaloids significantly reduced infarct size (standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.45; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = -0.64 to - 0.26). In subgroup analyses, isoquinoline alkaloids (SMD = -0.43; 95\%CI = -0.70 to - 0.16) significantly reduced infarct size versus the control. CONCLUSION: Isoquinoline alkaloids can potentially alleviate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. This meta-analysis and systematic review supply a reference for research programs aiming to develop alkaloid-based clinical drugs. This trial is registered with CRD42019135489.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic disease caused by Toxoplasma gondii, which is widespread in warm-blooded animals and humans. Currently, many studies regarding T. gondii infection in sheep have been published worldwide. However, there is no meta-analysis of sheep infection in China. In this study, five databases were used to retrieve articles related to T. gondii in China. A total of 59 studies from 1987 to June 30, 2020, have been included. We estimated that the combined prevalence of T. gondii in the selected period was 8.5\% (3197/28,099). In the analysis of publication year, the lowest positive rate after 2010 was 7.4\% (1883/17,313). Geographically, the highest prevalence of T. gondii in sheep was recorded in Southwest China 19.2\% (490/2080). Analysis according to age showed that the prevalence of infection in sheep older than 12 months was significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) higher than that in younger animals. The prevalence of T. gondii in sheep farmed by farmers was 7.2\% (566/6336), which was higher than 5.3\% (660/3121) of large-scale farming, suggesting a role for the feeding and husbandry. We also analyzed the impact of different geographic and climatic factors on the prevalence of T. gondii infection in sheep. The results showed that the prevalence was higher in low altitude, warm, humid, and high rainfall areas. We suggest that appropriate control programs should be formulated according to the differences in reproduction patterns and geographical conditions in different regions to reduce the prevalence of T. gondii among sheep in China.},

	abstract = {Cryptosporidium is an important zoonotic parasite that can infect a variety of hosts, including pigs and humans, through water and food. Many studies on Cryptosporidium infection in pigs have been reported worldwide. However, the meta-analysis of Cryptosporidium infection in pigs in China has not been published. This study retrieved articles related to Cryptosporidium in pigs in China by using four databases: Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), PubMed, VIP Chinese journal database and Wanfang Data. We retrieved 40 studies related to Cryptosporidium infection in China, and those articles were harvested from the inception to 1 January 2020. We estimated that the overall prevalence of pigs with Cryptosporidium in the selected period was 12.2\% (4,349/30,404). In the sampling year subgroup, the prevalence rate after 2010 was the lowest at 8.7\% (2,087/18,100). In Northern China, the Cryptosporidium prevalence was 47.9\% (34/71). By contrast, the prevalence of Cryptosporidium in Southwestern China was only 6.9\% (778/6,445). The infection rate of Cryptosporidium in diarrhoea pigs of 15.6\% (74/384) was higher than that in non-diarrhoea pigs at 10.8\% (378/2,840). Among the four age groups, the prevalence of weaning pigs of 16.2\% (530/3,243) was the highest, and the difference was significant (p {\textless} .05). The prevalence of Cryptosporidium in extensive farming was 25.7\% (660/3,121), which was significantly higher than in intensive farming 8.7\% (566/6,336), and the prevalence of infection was related to the farming modes (p {\textless} .05). We also analysed the impact of different geographic factor subgroups (longitude, latitude, precipitation, temperature, humidity, climate and altitude) on the prevalence of pigs. The results showed that cryptosporidiosis was widespread in pigs in China. We suggest that appropriate control schemes should be developed according to the differences in breeding patterns and geographic conditions in different regions, and effective management measures should be developed to reduce the spread between pigs.},

We conducted a systemic review regarding virus-induced pathogenesis, vaccine development, and diagnosis of H7N9 AIV infection in humans. We followed PRISMA guidelines and searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify relevant articles published between January 2013 and December 2018. Pathogenesis data indicated that H7N9 AIV belongs to low pathogenic avian influenza, which is mostly asymptomatic in avian species; however, H7N9 induces high mortality in humans. Sporadic human infections have recently been reported, caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses detected in poultry. H7N9 AIVs resistant to adamantine and oseltamivir cause severe human infection by rapidly inducing progressive acute community-acquired pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction, and cytokine dysregulation; however, mechanisms via which the virus induces severe syndromes remain unclear. An H7N9 AIV vaccine is lacking; designs under evaluation include synthesized peptide, baculovirus-insect system, and virus-like particle vaccines. Molecular diagnosis of H7N9 AIVs is suggested over conventional assays, for biosafety reasons. Several advanced or modified diagnostic assays are under investigation and development. We summarized virus-induced pathogenesis, vaccine development, and current diagnostic assays in H7N9 AIVs.},

Here, we present the first meta-analysis and integrated assessment of gaseous emissions and mitigation potentials for a typical beef cattle feedlot system, including methane (CH(4)), nitrous oxide (N(2)O), and NH(3) losses from enteric fermentation and manure management based on data from 104 studies. A total of 14 integrated emission factors (EF) and the mitigation efficiencies (ME) of 17 available options were provided. The estimated GHG and NH(3) emissions from the baseline feedlot system were 2786 ± 108 kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO(2)-eq) per animal unit (AU) per year and 49.1 ± 1.5 kg NH(3) AU(-1) year(-1), respectively. Enteric CH(4) fermentation and manure on the feedlot contributed 67.5\% and 80.8\% of the total system GHG and NH(3) emissions, respectively. The highest ME values were found for lipid additives for enteric CH(4) fermentation and urease inhibitor additives (UI) for NH(3) emissions from manure on the feedlot, being -14.9\% ( p {\textless} 0.05) and -59.5\% ( p {\textless} 0.001), respectively. The recommended mitigation combinations of a low-crude-protein (CP) diet and a UI additive for manure on the feedlot could reduce the GHG of the system by 4.9\% and NH(3) by 50.9\%.

Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the available preclinical evidence and possible mechanisms of baicalein for animal models of PD. Ultimately, 20 studies were identified by searching 7 databases from inception to December 2019. Review Manager 5.3 was applied for data analysis. Meta-analyses showed baicalein can significantly improve neurobehavioral function in animal models with PD, including spontaneous motor activity test (n = 5), pole test (n = 2), rotarod test (n = 9), apomorphine-induced rotations test (n = 4), grid test (n = 2), and tremor test (n = 2). Compared with controls, the results of the meta-analysis showed baicalein exerted a significant effect in increasing the frequency of spontaneous activity, prolongating the total time for climbing down the pole, decreasing the number of rotations, prolongating the descent latency, reducing the amplitude, and the frequency in animal models with PD. The possible mechanisms of baicalein for PD are regulating neurotransmitters, adjusting enzyme activity, antioxidation, anti-inflammatory, inhibiting protein aggregation, restorating mitochondrial dysfunction, inhibiting apoptosis, and autophagy. In conclusion, these findings preliminarily demonstrated that baicalein exerts potential neuroprotective effects through multiple signaling pathways in animal models of PD.},

Relevant data were extracted from the literature with mean and standard deviation (SD) being calculated and compiled in tables of relative organ weights (\% of body weight) and relative blood flows (\% of cardiac output). Trends of organ or tissue weight growth during different life stages were calculated when sufficient data were available. These compiled data sets facilitate future PBPK model development and applications, especially in estimating chemical residue concentrations in edible tissues to calculate food safety withdrawal intervals for poultry.},

Its effect on reproductive performance, however, is inconsistent due to conflicting data in the scientific literature. A meta-analysis of published data, therefore, was performed to determine whether altrenogest affects gilt and sow reproductive performance. Altrenogest administration to pigs enhanced the number of piglets born alive per litter (NBA), total number born per litter (TNB), estrous rate within 10 days after treatment (ER(10)) and pregnancy rate (PR) as well as the farrowing rate (FR) of gilts. The NBA and TNB of primiparous sows fed altrenogest were improved although FR was less. In multiparous sows, altrenogest treatment did not result in any improvement for any of the five analyzed variables. Additionally, 14-day treatment regimens for gilts and {\textgreater}8-days for primiparous sows improved reproductive performance and extent of estrous synchrony. The effects of altrenogest on reproductive performance of swine were parity and treatment duration dependent.},

This study aimed to identify human-relevant correlates between PFOA exposure and the male rodent reproductive system. We performed a systematic literature review of the relevant literature of PubMed, Cochrane Library databases, Web of Science and Embase from the establishment to April 2020. Studies included the effects of PFOA on the reproductive system of male rodents. The meta-analysis was performed on the basis of the following points: level of testosterone and estradiol in serum, development of reproductive organs, pathological changes of reproduction organs and parameters of semen. A series of 16 studies was enrolled in this study. The standard mean difference (SMD) for PFOA-related reproductive toxicity was summarised as -0.39 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71, -0.07). The lower serum testosterone levels, decreased absolute testicular and epididymal weights, higher serum estradiol levels, elevated relative testicular and seminal vesicle weights and increased incidence of Leydig cell adenoma and percentage of abnormal sperm were observed in the exposed group compared with the control group. However, no statistical difference was found in the day of preputial separation of pups and percentage of motile sperm. In conclusion, PFOA exposure heightens the reproductive system damage in male rodents. However, many studies included in the review did not identify mechanisms by which PFOA induces changes to the male reproductive system, which is an area for additional study.},

We aimed to establish the prevalence of Cryptosporidium, misrosporidia, and Isospora in HIV-infected people using a systematic review and meta-analysis, which is central to developing public policy and clinical services. METHODS: We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Embase, Chinese Web of Knowledge, Wanfang, and Chongqing VIP databases for studies reporting Cryptosporidium, microsporidia, or Isospora infection in HIV-infected people. We extracted the numbers of people with HIV and protozoa infection, and estimated the pooled prevalence of parasite infection by a random effects model. RESULTS: Our research identified 131 studies that reported Cryptosporidium, microsporidia, and Isospora infection in HIV-infected people. We estimated the pooled prevalence to be 14.0\% (3283/43,218; 95\% CI: 13.0-15.0\%) for Cryptosporidium, 11.8\% (1090/18,006; 95\% CI: 10.1-13.4\%) for microsporidia, and 2.5\% (788/105,922; 95\% CI: 2.1-2.9\%) for Isospora. A low prevalence of microsporidia and Isospora infection was found in high-income countries, and a high prevalence of Cryptosporidium and Isospora infection was found in sub-Saharan Africa. We also detected a high prevalence of Cryptosporidium, microsporidia, and Isospora infection in patients with diarrhea. Sensitivity analysis showed that three studies significantly affect the prevalence of Isospora, which was adjusted to 5.0\% (469/8570; 95\% CI: 4.1-5.9\%) by excluding these studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that HIV-infected people have a high prevalence of Cryptosporidium, microsporidia, and Isospora infection in low-income countries and patients with diarrhea, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, reinforcing the importance of routine surveillance for opportunistic intestinal protozoa in HIV-infected people.},

	abstract = {Management of burn patients is challenging, and requires a lot of knowledge and experience gained through research. However, experimental study on humans is not morally and ethically accepted. Porcine is the most frequently used experimental model because pig skin is anatomically and physiologically similar to human skin. We included systematic reviews, meta analyses, and experimental studies of burns using porcine models. We excluded studies conducted more than 10 years ago and which included only thermal injuries. Burn injury made to the porcine model had to be second or third degree. Searches of Ovid MEDLINE, Pubmed, Burns Journal and Cochrane Library revealed 21 relevant studies. Three methods used to create full thickness burn wounds were found: aluminium, brass, and immersion in hot water. The aluminium bar was heated to 200°C and placed on the pig's skin for 20 seconds. For deep dermal burns, there are different methods: modified glass bottle and aluminium bar. The bottle is filled with sterile water and heated to the desired temperature (92°C), then placed on the pig's skin for 15 seconds. To measure burn wound depth, almost all the studies used histopathological evaluation. There was no standardised method to create burn wounds in porcine models. Nevertheless, for deep dermal burn wounds, we can use the modified glass bottle method and for full thickness burn wounds, we can use aluminium or brass. There are no previous studies discussing how to make burn porcine models, nor any studies in this review that focused on creating the burn wound alone. Further studies are needed to achieve better results in creating burn wounds in porcine models.},

Evidence for extraskeletal effects of vitamin D has been accruing and it has been suggested that the effect of vitamin D on health is partially mediated through the microbiome. We aimed to critically evaluate the evidence linking vitamin D and the gastrointestinal microbiome. METHODS: We systematically searched the Embase, Web of Science, PubMed and CINAHL databases, including peer-reviewed publications that reported an association between a measure of vitamin D and the gastrointestinal microbiome in humans or experimental animals. RESULTS: We included 10 mouse and 14 human studies. Mouse studies compared mice fed diets containing different levels of vitamin D (usually high versus low), or vitamin D receptor knockout or Cyp27B1 knockout with wild-type mice. Five mouse studies reported an increase in Bacteroidetes (or taxa within that phylum) in the low vitamin D diet or gene knockout group. Human studies were predominantly observational; all but two of the included studies found some association between vitamin D and the gut microbiome, but the nature of differences observed varied across studies. CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial heterogeneity, we found evidence to support the hypothesis that vitamin D influences the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome. However, the research is limited, having been conducted either in mice or in mostly small, selected human populations. Future research in larger population-based studies is needed to fully understand the extent to which vitamin D modulates the microbiome.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that infects approximately 30\% of the population of the United States, with worldwide distribution. The chronic (latent) infection, mediated by the bradyzoite parasite life stage, has attracted attention due to possible links to host behavioral alteration and psychomotor effects. Mice are a common model organism for studying the chronic stage, as they are natural hosts of infection. Notably, published studies demonstrate vast ranges of measured cyst burden within the murine brain tissue. The inconsistency of measured cyst burden within and between experiments makes interpretation of statistical significance difficult, potentially confounding studies of experimental anti-parasitic approaches. This review analyzes variation in measured cyst burden in a wide array of experimental mouse infections across published literature. Factors such as parasite infection strain, mouse strain, mode of infection, and infectious dose were all examined. The lowest variation in measured cyst burden occurred with the commonly available Balb/c and CBA mice undergoing infection by the ME49 strain of T. gondii. A summary of cyst variation and average cyst counts in T. gondii mouse models is presented, which may be useful for designing future experiments.},

Here, to investigate sources of this heterogeneity, we perform meta-analyses of published studies on the relationship between carotenoid-based feather coloration and measures of individual quality. To create color displays, animals use either carotenoids unchanged from dietary components or carotenoids that they biochemically convert before deposition. We hypothesize that converted carotenoids better reflect individual quality because of the physiological links between cellular function and carotenoid metabolism. We show that feather coloration is an honest signal of some, but not all, measures of quality. Where these relationships exist, we show that converted, but not dietary, carotenoid coloration drives the relationship. Our results have broad implications for understanding the evolutionary role of carotenoid coloration and the physiological mechanisms that maintain signal honesty of animal ornamental traits.},

Relevant studies that meet standard inclusion criteria were identified and extracted from China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang and Chinese Scientific Journal (VIP) databases. A total of 9 studies with 539 subjects were included. A meta-analysis was performed with STATA15.0 to estimate the combined standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI). Heterogeneity test of articles was examined by Q-test, and the results showed that P values of feed conversion ratio, average daily gain (ADG), and average daily intake were all less than 0.05, suggesting a strong heterogeneity among the selected literature. Therefore, the random effect model is selected to calculate the SMD of the three indexes. The combined SMDs (95\% CI) of feed:gain, ADG, and average daily feed intake (ADFI) were -0.39 (-1.03, 0.25), 0.26 (-0.29, 0.81), and -1.45 (-3.09, 0.20), respectively, and the P values were all less than 0.05. This study shows that the absolute differences in the growth performance (feed:gain, ADG, and ADFI) of broilers fed with either organic or inorganic Se supplements at the same dose were quite small. The P values of Egger's test were 0.770, 0.089, and 0.426, respectively, for the above indexes, showing no significant publication bias.

	abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii is a widely distributed protozoan parasite that can infect a variety of warm-blooded animals including humans and goats. This is the first meta-analysis to assess the overall seroprevalence and potential risk factors of T. gondii infection among goats in China. Databases including the VIP Chinese Journal Databases (VIP), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, WanFang, ScienceDirect, and PubMed were searched comprehensively for relevant studies published from 2010 to date. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled seroprevalence estimates with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) and data were analyzed from 13 provinces in China. The pooled T. gondii seroprevalence in goats was estimated as 9.9\%. Goats T. gondii had the highest seroprevalence in Southwestern China (13.3\%) and the lowest in Northeastern China (7.3\%). The seroprevalence in the sub-group before 2012 (8.0\%) was lower than that in 2012-2015 (15.2\%) and 2016 or later (9.2\%). Goats aged {\textgreater} 12-months had a higher seroprevalence (11.7\%) than 12-months (10.7\%). The seroprevalence in female goats was 12.5\% and 12.2\% in male goats. In season subgroups, the seroprevalence was lowest in autumn (6.1\%). Naturally grazed goats had a seroprevalence of 8.1\% of infection and 7.8\% in intensively fed goats. We also evaluated the effects of geographical and climate variables on the pooled seroprevalence of T. gondii in goats in China. The results indicated that toxoplasmosis is widely distributed in goats in China. In the context of ensuring animal welfare, we suggest the continued promotion of the transition from natural grazing to intensive agriculture to strengthen disease prevention. Prevention would be better carried out in areas suitable for the survival and reproduction of T. gondii. Breeders need to regularly disinfect the feeding areas and pens or other areas of goat activity thoroughly to reduce the impact of environmental factors responses on the infection of goats to T. gondii.},

This is the first meta-analysis to assess the overall prevalence and potential risk factors of T. gondii among foxes in the world. Relevant studies were comprehensively collected from ScienceDirect, Springer-Link, PubMed, VIP Chinese Journal Databases (VIP), WanFang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. The random-effect model was used to calculate pooled prevalence with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) and analyzed data were from 20 countries. The pooled T. gondii prevalence in foxes was estimated to be 39.6\%. T. gondii has the highest prevalence in North America (51.2\%), and lowest in Asia (8.3\%). The prevalence in the sub-group after 2006 (44.7\%) was lower than 2006 or before (48.5\%). The prevalence in female foxes was 46.1\%, which was higher than that in male foxes (19.7\%). In species subgroup, red fox has the highest prevalence (46.8\%). Wild foxes have a higher rate of infection (40.8\%) than captive foxes (8.4\%). Genotype Ⅱ of T. gondii is the most prevalent in foxes. We also evaluated the effects of geographical and climate variables on pooled prevalence of T. gondii in foxes. Our research indicated that toxoplasmosis widely existed in the world. The investigation of T. gondii infection in wild animals can provide an estimate of environmental pollution and T. gondii circulation in the ecosystem. It is essential for us to prevent and control T. gondii infection in foxes in order to reduce the risk of human infection.},

Various surgical interventions have been described, but effective technique is currently considered to be a matter of personal clinician preference. The aim of this rapid review was to evaluate existing peer-reviewed evidence of effectiveness for surgical techniques and their subsequent effects on quantitative and clinical lacrimal outcomes for PNG. We performed a structured bibliographic search of CAB Abstracts, PubMed, and Medline using terms relevant to dogs, nictitans gland, and surgery on 13 September 2017. Included studies were assessed for study design, reporting characteristics, surgical techniques, and surgical and lacrimal outcomes. Fifteen of three hundred fifteen identified studies were eligible for inclusion. Seven different replacement techniques were identified, along with gland excision. All studies were observational or descriptive, with the exception of a single crossover trial. Outcomes reporting was heterogeneous and provided limited detail on lacrimal outcomes or on breed propensity for recurrence. Insufficient data precluded comparison of techniques for either surgical failure rates or lacrimal outcomes, although proportional meta-analysis yielded an overall failure rate of 3\% (95\% CI 1⁻7\%) for the Morgan's pocket procedure. Improved reporting of veterinary surgical studies will improve evidence appraisal and synthesis, as well as reduce potential sources of bias.},

Methodological quality of the studies was assessed using a modified McMaster critical appraisal tool. RESULTS: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria and overall, positive trends were identified in behavioural, psychological and physical outcome measures following the participation in an EAT. However, due to methodological constraints, caution is required when interpreting these findings. CONCLUSION: While EAT may offer some positive benefits for children with ADHD, further methodologically robust research is required before definitive recommendations can be made.},

With the exception of studies on cold-stressed laying hens, the results of studies of Cr supplementation of chickens, whether broilers or laying hens, were found to be too inconsistent for any firm conclusions to be drawn other than that Cr supplementation generally leads to accumulation of Cr in tissues. Few potential trends in terms or beneficial or deleterious effects from Cr supplementation were found regardless of strain of chicken, Cr source, Cr dose, duration of supplementation, or variable examined. Hence, in summary, no recommendation for the use of Cr as a supplement for the diet of chickens can be made at this time.},

Studies were appraised for quality using the SYstematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) risk of bias tool. In spite of an acceptable number of studies being located, few studies examined the same pairwise comparisons. Additionally, there was considerable heterogeneity in study design and outcomes, with many studies being at a high risk of bias. Consequently, results were synthesised using the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) reporting guidelines. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was utilised for assessment of certainty in the evidence. Due to the heterogeneity and GRADE findings, it was concluded that there was not enough high-quality evidence to make any recommendations on the optimal method of blood sampling.

A comprehensive scoping review of the academic literature was performed. A total of 48 articles met our inclusion criteria and were included in this review. The MGS has been employed mainly in the evaluation of acute pain, particularly in the pain and neuroscience research fields. There has, however, been use of the technique in a wide range of fields, and based on limited study it does appear to have utility for pain assessment across a spectrum of animal models. Use of the method allows the detection of pain of a longer duration, up to a month post initial insult.

	abstract = {The reported incidence of clinical hepatitis E cases is rising in some non-endemic countries, with concurrent concerns regarding potential hepatitis E virus (HEV) contamination of the blood supply. Therefore, the characterization of major potential sources of human HEV exposure is important to inform risk assessment and public health policy. A systematic review was conducted, including a comprehensive search in six electronic bibliographic databases, verified by hand-searching reference lists of HEV reviews, and a grey literature search, of the broad research question 'what is the evidence of the association between predictors of human HEV exposure, and HEV IgG seropositivity, in non-endemic countries?' Using forms designed a priori, captured studies were appraised at first-level screening, second-level characterization, and third-level data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Meta-analysis yielded summary estimates of association between potential predictors and odds of HEV seropositivity. Meta-analysis and meta-regression of the odds of HEV seroprevalence in specific groups characterized potential sources of HEV exposure. From 4,163 captured citations, 245 relevant studies underwent data extraction, investigating HEV seroprevalence or predictors in both healthy subjects and targeted patient groups. Across these groups, increasing age was a predictor of HEV IgG seropositivity. Both human immunodeficiency virus patients and haemodialysis patients had significantly increased odds of HEV seropositivity relative to the general population. Working with pigs, in forestry, or in hospitals, was significantly associated with increased odds of HEV seropositivity, as were consumption of meat, pork or game meat, or hunting. Chronological time was not associated with HEV seropositivity within our data sets. Further study of the distribution of potential dietary or behavioural predictors between high and lower prevalence areas within non-endemic countries could improve our understanding of the relative importance of specific HEV transmission pathways.},

	abstract = {Effective infection control (IC) provides a safe environment for staff, clients and animals of veterinary practices by reducing the risk of nosocomial and zoonotic infections, which are associated with increased hospital stays, costs, morbidity and mortality. An equally important issue arising from nosocomial infection is the loss of trust between the client and the veterinary practice that has potential negative impacts on the veterinary practice in terms of economic risk and the well-being of staff. Furthermore, an emerging and significant threat, in this context, is antimicrobial resistance. The aim of this systematic review was to critically review published reports that documented current IC practices and evaluated interventions to improve IC practices. A systematic literature search using ten databases to identify papers published over a 20-year period (February 1996 to February 2016) was conducted for studies that met the inclusion criteria. Included studies were assessed using the PRISMA and STROBE-Vet statements. A total of 14 of 1,615 identified studies met our inclusion criteria. Infection control practices included hand hygiene, sharps handling, environmental cleaning, personal protective equipment and personnel vaccination. Descriptive studies were the predominant research design for assessing IC compliance. Only three studies were interventions. Compliance with IC protocols was poor and only marginally increased with multimodal educational campaigns. There was significant variation in the implementation of IC by veterinary staff. Workplaces that had IC policies, management support and a staff member supporting their implementation were more likely to embrace good IC. Infection control data in veterinary practices were inconsistently reported and collected. Clearly defining IC and determining prevalence of these practices within the veterinary field is important given the limited research in this area. Further, developing and implementing educational campaigns for this sector is needed.},

To monitor improvements made to elephant welfare in UK zoos, non-invasive, valid and reliable indicators of welfare are needed. Using a rapid review strategy and critical appraisal tool, we aimed to appraise evidence from peer-reviewed literature on potential welfare indicators for captive elephants. Scopus, Web of Knowledge and Ovid were searched in January 2014 using terms relevant to captive elephants and welfare assessment. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and remaining articles were critically appraised against a specially designed welfare indicator appraisal tool. Thirty-seven unique indicators of welfare were extracted from 30 peer-reviewed papers which met the inclusion criteria. Behavioural measures of welfare (n=21) were more common than either physical (n=11) or physiological (n=5) measures. Stereotypies were the most frequently used behavioural measure, glucocorticoids were the most frequently used physiological measure and body condition scores were the most frequently used physical measure. There was most support for the following indicators of improved welfare state: reduced stereotypies, reduced glucocorticoids and improved body condition scores. Additional measures which require further validation but had strong associations with the most supported measures, and thus have potential use in welfare assessment, were: increased lying rest and positive social interactions. Further validation of the described measures is needed, but this information forms a crucial part of the knowledge required to efficiently monitor and improve the welfare of elephants in captivity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Conducting effective and culturally sensitive dog health education programs in Aboriginal communities requires an understanding of appropriate adult education and community development principles. Finding relevant material can be difficult, given that many of the available resources are in the 'grey literature'. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To critically review publications addressing the principles governing dog health education in remote Aboriginal communities. METHODS: A critical review was performed by searching English language peer-reviewed and grey literature databases for papers published between 2010 and 2018. Besides a small number of peer-reviewed papers, there was an extensive list of reports, educational material, guidelines and posters and pamphlets that illustrated the principles. Only a small amount of this grey literature was selected for the review. Selection was based on the publication illustrating a specific principle of dog health education. The material was organised around educational themes highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of these publications. RESULTS: Findings suggested that although relevant literature is scattered, there are clear processes for conducting culturally appropriate and effective dog health programs in Australian Indigenous communities. Two major principles were identified: acknowledging the effect on education of the ambiguity around the status of dogs in Aboriginal communities, and embedding programs within a social determinant of health framework or community development approach. These two principles provide guidance on negotiating educational sessions, the preparation of culturally appropriate materials, teaching sessions and what learning styles to foster and the use of a health promotion approach. CONCLUSIONS: Some contradictions exist within the literature, particularly around the use of images, and consistent with the first principle, a hesitancy to engage with Aboriginal people around the issue of dog health.},

	volume = {101},

	doi = {10.3168/jds.2017-14092},
	abstract = {Disbudding is a common management procedure performed on dairy farms and, when done without pain mitigation, is viewed as a key welfare issue. Use of pain control has increased in recent years, but full adoption of anesthesia and analgesia by veterinarians or dairy producers has not been achieved. This may in part be due to the lack of a consistent recommendations of treatment protocols between studies examining pain control methods for disbudding. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the effects of these pain control practices for the most common method of disbudding, cautery, on outcomes associated with disbudding pain in calves. The outcomes were plasma cortisol concentrations, pressure sensitivity of the horn bud area, and validated pain behaviors (ear flick, head shake, head rub, foot stamp, and vocalization). Intervention studies describing cautery disbudding in calves 12 wk of age or younger were eligible, provided they compared local anesthesia, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), or local anesthesia and NSAID to 1 or more of local anesthesia, NSAID, or no pain control. The search strategy used the Agricola, Medline (via OvidSP), and Web of Science databases, as well as the Searchable Proceedings of Animal Conferences (S-PAC), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Database, and Open Access Theses and Dissertations. Meta-analysis was performed for all outcomes measured at similar time points with more than 2 studies. Local anesthetic was associated with reduced plasma cortisol until 2 h postdisbudding; however, a rise in cortisol was observed in the meta-analysis of studies reporting at 4 h postdisbudding. Heterogeneity was present in several of the analyses for this comparison. The addition of NSAID to local anesthetic showed reduction in plasma cortisol at 4 h, and a reduction in pressure sensitivity and pain behaviors in some analyses between 3 and 6 h postdisbudding. Heterogeneity was present in some meta-analyses, including several using pain behavior outcomes. This may reflect the variation in measurement time periods for behavioral measures between studies, as well as differences among NSAID treatments. Overall, a protective effect of local anesthetic was seen for the acute pain of cautery disbudding, and the delayed rise in cortisol was mitigated by the addition of an NSAID, which also reduced other signs of pain, including pressure sensitivity and pain behaviors. Based on these findings, we recommend use of local anesthetic and an NSAID as best practices for pain mitigation for cautery disbudding of calves 12 wk of age or less. The magnitude and duration of the effect of NSAID treatment was not possible to deduce from the literature because wide variation existed between studies. We recommend consideration of more standardized outcome measurements, especially for pain behaviors. Adherence to reporting guidelines by authors would help ensure more transparent and complete information is available to end users.},

Controlled trials in lactating dairy cattle with natural disease exposure were eligible if they compared an antimicrobial treatment to a non-treated control, placebo, or a different antimicrobial, for the treatment of clinical mastitis, and assessed clinical or bacteriologic cure. Potential for bias was assessed using a modified Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. From 14775 initially identified records, 54 trials were assessed as eligible. Networks were established for bacteriologic cure by bacterial species group, and clinical cure. Disparate networks among bacteriologic cures precluded meta-analysis. Network meta-analysis was conducted for trials assessing clinical cure, but lack of precision of point estimates resulted in wide credibility intervals for all treatments, with no definitive conclusions regarding relative efficacy. Consideration of network geometry can inform future research to increase the utility of current and previous work. Replication of intervention arms and consideration of connection to existing networks would improve the future ability to determine relative efficacy. Challenges in the evaluation of bias in primary research stemmed from a lack of reporting. Consideration of reporting guidelines would also improve the utility of future research.},

Subgroup analysis showed that, for trials using internal teat sealants, there was no difference in IMI risk at calving between groups, and no heterogeneity was present. For trials not using internal teat sealants, there was an increased risk in cows assigned to a selective dry-cow therapy protocol, compared to blanket treatment, with substantial heterogeneity in this subgroup.

	abstract = {Q fever caused by the gram negative bacteria, Coxiella burnetii, is an occupational hazard for those who live and work in rural settings and those who are in contact with animals, especially abattoir and slaughterhouse workers. Australia is the only country to register a vaccine to prevent Q fever (Q-vaxR, Seqirus, Australia) that is used in high risk populations. Seroprevalence studies conducted to determine the burden of Q fever (C. burnetii infection) in different settings have demonstrated high levels of heterogeneity with estimates of the percent positive ranging from 30\% to 70\%. There is a need for a more systematic evaluation of the findings of these studies in order to provide summary estimates of the seroprevalence in different settings. We searched for published articles using PubMed, MEDLINE-EMBASE, and Scopus databases using search terms obtained from an initial review of published reports of recent Q fever outbreaks. Data on the seroprevalence of C. burnetii infection (Q fever) was extracted from the selected studies and a random effects meta-analysis was performed with stratification by outbreak status, year, country and serological techniques used. Results were visualised with a forest plot with 95\% CI and measures of heterogeneity (I$^{\textrm{2}}$) for the random effects model. A total of 19 articles that met the search criteria were included. The reported seroprevalence rate ranged from 4.7\% to 91.7\% among abattoir and slaughterhouse workers. No inter-group heterogeneity was observed (p=0.956), supporting the pooling of all studies into one pooled measure. The pooled estimate of seropositivity for C. burnetii infection in people working in abattoirs and slaughterhouses was 26\% (95\% CI: 18-35\%) regardless of the evidence of an "outbreak", the time of year or country. Seropositivity for C burnetii was independent of a person's age and years of occupational experience. Within abattoirs and slaughterhouses, slaughtering of cattle, sheep and goats are the most important risk factors associated with seropositivity and for those who showed over symptoms upon infection. We recommend that vaccination programmes are directed towards people employed in the meat processing industry to mitigate the significant health and economic impacts of Q fever.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Osteosynthesis-associated infection is a challenging complication post fracture fixation, burdening the patients and the orthopaedic surgeons alike. A clinically relevant animal model is critical in devising new therapeutic strategies. Our aim was to perform a systematic review to evaluate existing preclinical models and identify their applications in aspects of animal selection, bacterial induction, fracture fixation and complications. METHODS: A systematic literature research was conducted in PubMed and Embase up to February 2020. A total of 31 studies were included. Information on the animal, bacterial induction, fracture fixation, healing result and complications were extracted. RESULTS: Animals selected included murine (23), rabbit (6), ewe (1) and goat (1). Larger animals had enabled the use of human-sized implant, however small animals were more economical and easier in handling. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was the most frequently chosen bacteria for induction. Bacterial inoculation dose ranged from 10(2-8) ​CFU. Consistent and replicable infections were observed from 10(4) ​CFU in general. Methods of inoculation included injections of bacterial suspension (20), placement of foreign objects (8) and pretreatment of implants with established biofilm (3). Intramedullary implants (13), plates and screws (18) were used in most models. Radiological (29) and histological evaluations (24) in osseous healing were performed. Complications such as instability of fracture fixation (7), unexpected surgical death (5), sepsis (1) and persistent lameness (1) were encountered. CONCLUSION: The most common animal model is the S. aureus infected open fracture internally fixated. Replicable infections were mainly from 10(4) ​CFU of bacteria. However, with the increase in antibiotic resistance, future directions should explore polymicrobial and antibiotic resistant strains, as these will no doubt play a major role in bone infection. Currently, there is also a lack of osteoporotic bone infection models and the pathophysiology is unexplored, which would be important with our aging population. THE TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THIS ARTICLE: This systematic review provides an updated overview and compares the currently available animal models of osteosynthesis-associated infections. A discussion on future research directions and suggestion of animal model settings were made, which is expected to advance the research in this field.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.clirex.2019.100002},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently given to patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) for controlling pain, but their efficacy in treating AP, particularly in reducing systemic complications, remains unclear. AIM: The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of NSAIDs in treating AP and its systematic complications. METHODS: Two independent reviewers screened articles from MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane and scored the quality of each study according to the CAMARADES 10-item quality checklist or the Jadad scale. Five endpoints were chosen to evaluate the effect of NSAIDs in animal studies: amylase and lipase levels, proinflammatory cytokines, oxidative damage, histopathological changes, and mortality rate. Meanwhile, in clinical studies, endpoints, such as proinflammatory cytokines, pain relief, systematic complications, mortality, and adverse events were used. RESULTS: A total of 36 studies out of 17,845 were identified and included. Of these 36 studies, only 5 were clinical trials involving 580 patients, and the remaining 31 were animal studies with 1623 rats or mice. 24 studies focused on the treatment of AP with NSAIDs and 12 on AP-associated systematic complications. Both preclinical and clinical studies showed that NSAIDs may have beneficial effects against AP-related injuries. 9 of the 14 preclinical studies stated that NSAIDs reduced the serum amylase level significantly, and 6 of 7 showed that NSAIDs lowered the lipase level markedly. 17 experimental studies all demonstrated that NSAIDs reduced the inflammation. Histopathological examinations indicated that NSAIDs significantly improved the histopathological damages. Similarly, clinical evidence showed that NSAIDs are effective in suppressing proinflammatory cytokines, relieving pain, ameliorating systematic complications and reducing mortality. In the included 5 clinical studies, serious adverse events associated with NSAIDs were rarely reported. CONCLUSION: This systematic review shows that NSAIDs are a potential treatment for AP-related injuries based on the current preclinical and clinical evidences.},

We extracted data from 16 studies on milk (5,193 subjects) and 10 studies on dairy products (20,434 subjects). The total study population included 220,952 individuals. Dairy product intake and bladder cancer risk were significantly associated, and milk intake and bladder cancer risk more so. Stratified analysis revealed that the trend was more pronounced in case-control studies, and in studies with impact factor {\textless}3 and in Asia. The relationship was confirmed after adjusting for sex and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale score of 7 and 8. Our study shows an inverse association between milk consumption and bladder cancer risk.},

This systematic review aimed to evaluate whether early life (the first 1,000 days) natural exposure to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and ruminant trans fatty acids (R-TFA) could affect the AD risk. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception through September 10, 2017 for relevant full-text articles in English. Observational studies were selected if they examined the effects of early life PUFA or R-TFA on AD (eczema, asthma, wheeze, and allergic rhinitis) or sensitization. The quality of studies was examined by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the best evidence synthesis (BES) was applied. We included 26 observational studies, and 8 of them showed high quality. BES showed a moderate evidence for the protective effect of vaccenic acid (VA, an R-TFA) on eczema, while insufficient or no evidence was found in other associations. Meta-analysis showed that higher n-6/n-3 ratio and linoleic acid were associated with higher risk of eczema (pooled odds ratio [OR] = 1.06, 95\% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.00 -1.13; 1.08, 95\% CI: 1.01 -1.15). However, VA was inversely associated with eczema pooled OR = 0.42, 95\% CI: 0.25 -0.72). Early life natural exposure to VA showed evident benefit on decreasing the risk of eczema, while PUFA and other R-TFA showed limited effects on AD. More robust studies especially for R-TFA are required.},

	abstract = {Although mangiferin has a number of documented beneficial effects, there are no systematic reviews or meta-analyses of its effects in diabetic animal models. To investigate the effects of oral administration of mangiferin on blood glucose levels, body weight, and total cholesterol and triglycerides levels in diabetic animal models, a meta-analysis was conducted and the underlying mechanisms were reviewed. Studies from 6 databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), and Wanfang Med) were searched from inception to April 2020. After article screening, a total of 19 articles were included in this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 and STATA 14.0 software. The overall pooled estimate of standardized mean difference (SMD) of mangiferin's effect on blood glucose was -1.27 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: -1.71, -0.82, P {\textless} .00001). Body weight increased in lean diabetic animals with an SMD of 1.41 (95\% CI: 0.57, 2.25; P = .001), while it decreased in obese diabetic animals with an SMD of -0.92 (95\% CI: -1.69, -0.14; P = .02). Mangiferin intake reduced serum total cholesterol and triglycerides levels with SMDs of -1.02 (95\% CI: -1.43, -0.61; P {\textless} .001) and -1.24 (95\% CI: -1.70, -0.79; P {\textless} .001), respectively. The meta-analysis suggests that oral intake of mangiferin has a significant antidiabetic effect in animal models, and the systematic review suggested that this function might be attributed to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, as well as to its function of improving glycolipid metabolism and enhancing insulin signaling.},

	abstract = {Large-scale phenotyping of animal behaviour traits is time consuming and has led to increased demand for technologies that can automate these procedures. Automated tracking of animals has been successful in controlled laboratory settings, but recording from animals in large groups in highly variable farm settings presents challenges. The aim of this review is to provide a systematic overview of the advances that have occurred in automated, high throughput image detection of farm animal behavioural traits with welfare and production implications. Peer-reviewed publications written in English were reviewed systematically following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. After identification, screening, and assessment for eligibility, 108 publications met these specifications and were included for qualitative synthesis. Data collected from the papers included camera specifications, housing conditions, group size, algorithm details, procedures, and results. Most studies utilized standard digital colour video cameras for data collection, with increasing use of 3D cameras in papers published after 2013. Papers including pigs (across production stages) were the most common (n = 63). The most common behaviours recorded included activity level, area occupancy, aggression, gait scores, resource use, and posture. Our review revealed many overlaps in methods applied to analysing behaviour, and most studies started from scratch instead of building upon previous work. Training and validation sample sizes were generally small (mean±s.d. groups = 3.8±5.8) and in data collection and testing took place in relatively controlled environments. To advance our ability to automatically phenotype behaviour, future research should build upon existing knowledge and validate technology under commercial settings and publications should explicitly describe recording conditions in detail to allow studies to be reproduced.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Racing performance is often used as a measurable outcome variable in research studies investigating clinical diagnoses or interventions. However, the use of many different performance measures largely precludes conduct of meaningful comparative studies and, to date, those being used have not been collated. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the veterinary scientific literature for the use of racing performance as a measurable outcome variable in clinical studies of racehorses, collate and identify those most popular, and identify their advantages and disadvantages. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature search. METHODS: The search criteria "((racing AND performance) AND (horses OR equidae))" were adapted for both MEDLINE and CAB Abstracts databases. Data were collected in standardised recording forms for binary, categorical and quantitative measures, and the use of performance indices. RESULTS: In total, 217 studies that described racing performance were identified, contributing 117 different performance measures. No one performance measure was used in all studies, despite 90.3\% using more than one variable. Data regarding race starts and earnings were used most commonly, with 88.0\% and 54.4\% of studies including at least one measure of starts and earnings, respectively. Seventeen variables were used 10 times or more, with the top five comprising: 'return to racing', 'number of starts', 'days to first start', 'earnings per period of time' and 'earnings per start'. MAIN LIMITATIONS: The search strategies may not have identified all relevant papers, introducing bias to the review. CONCLUSIONS: Performance indices have been developed to improve assessment of interventions; however, they are not widely adopted in the scientific literature. Use of the two most commonly identified measures, whether the horse returned to racing and number of starts over a defined period of time, would best facilitate future systematic reviews and meta-analyses in advance of the development of a gold-standard measure of race performance outcome.},

	doi = {10.1093/humupd/dmz017},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A defining feature of sexual reproduction is the transmission of genomic information from both parents to the offspring. There is now compelling evidence that the inheritance of such genetic information is accompanied by additional epigenetic marks, or stable heritable information that is not accounted for by variations in DNA sequence. The reversible nature of epigenetic marks coupled with multiple rounds of epigenetic reprogramming that erase the majority of existing patterns have made the investigation of this phenomenon challenging. However, continual advances in molecular methods are allowing closer examination of the dynamic alterations to histone composition and DNA methylation patterns that accompany development and, in particular, how these modifications can occur in an individual's germline and be transmitted to the following generation. While the underlying mechanisms that permit this form of transgenerational inheritance remain unclear, it is increasingly apparent that a combination of genetic and epigenetic modifications plays major roles in determining the phenotypes of individuals and their offspring. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Information pertaining to transgenerational inheritance was systematically reviewed focusing primarily on mammalian cells to the exclusion of inheritance in plants, due to inherent differences in the means by which information is transmitted between generations. The effects of environmental factors and biological processes on both epigenetic and genetic information were reviewed to determine their contribution to modulating inheritable phenotypes. SEARCH METHODS: Articles indexed in PubMed were searched using keywords related to transgenerational inheritance, epigenetic modifications, paternal and maternal inheritable traits and environmental and biological factors influencing transgenerational modifications. We sought to clarify the role of epigenetic reprogramming events during the life cycle of mammals and provide a comprehensive review of how the genomic and epigenomic make-up of progenitors may determine the phenotype of its descendants. OUTCOMES: We found strong evidence supporting the role of DNA methylation patterns, histone modifications and even non-protein-coding RNA in altering the epigenetic composition of individuals and producing stable epigenetic effects that were transmitted from parents to offspring, in both humans and rodent species. Multiple genomic domains and several histone modification sites were found to resist demethylation and endure genome-wide reprogramming events. Epigenetic modifications integrated into the genome of individuals were shown to modulate gene expression and activity at enhancer and promoter domains, while genetic mutations were shown to alter sequence availability for methylation and histone binding. Fundamentally, alterations to the nuclear composition of the germline in response to environmental factors, ageing, diet and toxicant exposure have the potential to become hereditably transmitted. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The environment influences the health and well-being of progeny by working through the germline to introduce spontaneous genetic mutations as well as a variety of epigenetic changes, including alterations in DNA methylation status and the post-translational modification of histones. In evolutionary terms, these changes create the phenotypic diversity that fuels the fires of natural selection. However, rather than being adaptive, such variation may also generate a plethora of pathological disease states ranging from dominant genetic disorders to neurological conditions, including spontaneous schizophrenia and autism.},

	abstract = {To review and assess the efficacy of laser photobiomodulation for cartilage defect in animal models of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Medline, Web of Science, and EMBASE were searched. Studies were considered if the global quality score of cartilage were parallelly reported between laser and untreated control groups. The methodological quality of each study was assessed using a modified 10-item checklist. The effect size was estimated by standardized mean difference (SMD) and pooled based on the random-effects model. Stratified analysis and regression analysis were conducted to partition potential heterogeneity. An adjusted significant level of 0.01 was acceptable. Five hundred eight initial search recordings were identified, of which 14 studies (including 274 animals) were included for quantitative analysis. The global quality scores mostly weighted by the structural integrity and chondrocyte distribution were measured by different four scales including Histologic Histochemical Grading System (HHGS), Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI), Pineda, and Huang. There were considerable variances on laser parameters and irradiation time among those included studies. Overall, a moderate level of methodological qualities was determined. The synthesis results indicated that the SMD effect size was significantly larger in HHGS (z = 2.61, P = 0.01) and Huang (z = 4.90, P {\textless} 0.01) groups. Stratified by irradiance, SMD of low ({\textless} 1 W/cm(2)) but not high (≥ 1 W/cm(2)) level estimated significant difference (z = 5.62, P {\textless} 0.01). Meta-regression identified a significant association for SMDs and irradiation time (P {\textless} 0.01). Yet, Egger's test detected small study effect (P {\textless} 0.01). No individual study with significant variance was found in homogeneity tests. The results demonstrated the positive effect of laser photobiomodulation for cartilage defect in animal models of KOA under proper irradiance and adequate irradiation time.},

Thus, the purpose of the present study is to evaluate the preclinical animal studies of MSCs injection for KOA and to determine the evidence for a role for MSCs in further clinical trials. METHODS: A systematic search of KOA animal studies published through Aug 2017 was conducted using the PubMed, Embase and Web of science. Criteria for eligibility were animal studies assessing the therapeutic effects of MSCs intra-articular injection to animals with KOA. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed by the SYRCLE tool for assessing risk of bias in animal intervention studies. Descriptive synthesis was performed. Evidence quality was evaluated based on the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (CERQual) tool. RESULTS: Twenty-three KOA animal studies were eligible for inclusion. According to the SYRCLE's tool, all included studies had high risk of bias. Between-study heterogeneity was substantial. The included studies varied in terms of species, modeling methods, MSCs origin, treatment timing, injections frequency, transplantation type and dose of MSCs. The following outcomes, gross morphology, histological analysis, immunohistochemical analysis, radiological evaluation or behavior analysis, were reported in the primary studies. For all outcomes, the evidence quality was low or very low. CONCLUSIONS: We do not have absolute confidence to recommend use MSCs injection for KOA clinical trials. Based on the internal and external validity of current animal studies, high quality experimental studies and efforts for effective translation from preclinical studies to clinical trials are still required.},

	abstract = {Fermented feed (FF) is recommended due to its high nutritional value and digestibility, but the effects on pig growth performance are inconsistent. This meta-analysis was conducted to quantify the effects of FF on pig growth performance. We systematically searched in PubMed and Web of Science for studies (published between January 1st, 2000 and December 20th, 2018) comparing the effects of FF supplementation with basal diet on pig growth performance. The main outcomes were average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain: feed ratio (G/F). Random-effects model was used to compute the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI). The robustness of the pooled estimates was determined using sensitivity and subgroup analyses. Fermented materials included in the subgroup analysis were classified as ingredients (protein and energy sources) and additives (plant materials added at low levels). Of 1371 identified articles, 25 were eligible and were included in the meta-analysis (n=2391 pigs). Compared with the basal diet, FF supplementation improved ADG and G/F of weaned piglets (ADG: WMD=20.869 g/day, 95\% CI: 15.007-26.731, P{\textless}0.001; G/F: WMD=0.023, 95\% CI: 0.013 to 0.032, P{\textless}0.001), growing pigs (ADG: WMD=23.938 g/day, 95\% CI: 15.342-32.533, P{\textless}0.001; G/F: WMD=0.014, 95\% CI: 0.006 to 0.022, P=0.001), and finishing pigs (ADG: WMD=40.151 g/day, 95\% CI: 6.118-74.183, P=0.021; G/F: WMD=0.022, 95\% CI: 0.005 to 0.038, P=0.009), but had no effect on ADFI (P{\textgreater}0.05). The subgroup analyses revealed that fermented feed ingredients could boost the growth performance of weaned piglets and growing pigs. The fermented feed additives promoted growth at all stages. FF supplementation can enhance pig growth performance of which the enhancement in feed efficiency is due to the improvement in nutritional value and availability rather than feed intake.},

This study aimed to (i) quantitatively evaluate the effects of fermentation on nutritional components of feed stuffs; (ii) quantitatively evaluate the effects of FF on pig growth performance, digestibility, and meat quality; and (iii) explore the dose-effect relationship. From PubMed and Web of Science (searched range from January 1, 2000 to April 4, 2019), we collected 3,271 articles, of which 30 articles (3,562 pigs) were included in our meta-analysis. Our analysis revealed that fermentation significantly increased the CP content in feed (P {\textless} 0.05). For weaned piglets and growing pigs, FF significantly improved ADG, G:F, DM digestibility, N digestibility, and energy digestibility (P {\textless} 0.05). However, compared with the basal diet, FF had no significant effects on growth performance and nutrient digestibility in finishing pigs (P {\textgreater} 0.05). In the subgroup analyses, fermented ingredients increased the growth performance of weaned piglets and growing pigs, and fermented additives promoted the growth of pigs at all stages. The dose-effect analysis confirmed that the optimal doses of fermented ingredients and additives were 8\% and 0.15\%, respectively. Furthermore, FF had beneficial impacts on meat quality through increased lightness, redness, marbling and flavor and reduced drip loss (P {\textless} 0.05). In conclusions, FF improved growth performance and meat quality primarily due to its positive effects on nutritive value and utilization.},

DATA SOURCES: Using "spinal cord injury", "resveratrol" and "animal experiment" as the main search terms, all studies on the treatment of spinal cord injury in rats by resveratrol were searched for in PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Science Direct, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, VIP, and SinoMed databases by computer. The search was conducted from their inception date to April 2017. No language restriction was used in the literature search. DATA SELECTION: The methodological quality of each study was assessed by the initial Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable recommendations. Two reviewers independently selected studies according to the title, abstract and full text. The risk of bias in the included studies was also evaluated. Meta-analyses were performed with Review Manager 5.3 software. OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurological function was assessed by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale score, inclined plane score and Gale's motor function score. Molecular-biological analysis of antioxidative effects was conducted to determine superoxide dismutase levels, malondialdehyde levels, nitric oxide synthase activity, nitric oxide levels, xanthine oxidase and glutathione levels in spinal cord tissues. RESULTS: The methodological quality of the 12 included studies was poor. The results of meta-analysis showed that compared with the control group, resveratrol significantly increased the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale scores after spinal cord injury (n = 300, mean difference (MD) = 3.85, 95\% confidence interval (CI) [2.10, 5.59], P {\textless} 0.0001). Compared with the control group, superoxide dismutase levels were significantly elevated (n = 138, standardized mean difference (SMD) = 5.22, 95\% CI [2.98, 7.45], P {\textless} 0.00001), but malondialdehyde levels were significantly diminished (n = 84, SMD = -3.64, 95\% CI [-5.84, -1.43], P = 0.001) in the spinal cord of the resveratrol treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: Resveratrol promoted neurological recovery and exerted antioxidative effects in rat models of spinal cord injury. The limited quality of the included studies reduces the application of this meta-analysis. Therefore, more high-quality studies are needed to provide more rigorous and objective evidence for the pre-clinical treatment of spinal cord injury.},

The objective of this study was to systematically review the evidence and investigate how thedifferences in schedules influence titres over time. METHODS: Four databaseswere searched from inception to January 2020 for rabies PrEP and PEP studies. Adose-response meta-analysis was utilised to pool geometric mean titres (GMT) over time. Subgroup analyses by route of administration, age group, and schedule were conducted. RESULTS: 80 studies met the inclusion criteria and contributed with 191 datasets and 12,413 participants. Both intradermal (ID) and intramuscular (IM) PrEP/PEP produce adequate GMTs. Significantly lower GMT levels were achieved in older ({\textgreater}50yrs) compared to younger ({\textless}50yrs) participants. Short 1-week schedules were as effective as longer schedules that can take between 3 and 12 weeks to complete. CONCLUSIONS: Several effective ID and IM schedules were identified, the selection of a schedule should take into account the patient's needs, costs, availability to return for subsequent doses, and the time required to complete the schedule.

This review aims to examine the potential molecular mechanisms through which GH-related signaling modulates sensory hypersensitivity in rodents, the clinical pharmacology of GH, and the clinical evidence of GH treatment for several common pain syndromes. METHODS: A search was conducted using the PUBMED/MEDLINE database, Scopus, and the Cochrane library for all reports published in English on GH in pain management from inception through May 2018. A critical review was performed on the mechanisms of GH-related signaling and the pharmacology of GH. The levels of clinical evidence and implications for recommendations of all of the included studies were graded. RESULTS: The search yielded 379 articles, of which 201 articles were deemed irrelevant by reading the titles. There were 53 reports deemed relevant after reading abstracts. All of these 53 articles were retrieved for the analysis and discussion. CONCLUSIONS: Dysfunction of the GH/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)/ghrelin axis was linked to hyperalgesia and several common clinical pain syndromes. Low levels of GH and IGF-1 were linked to pain hypersensitivity, whereas ghrelin appeared to provide analgesic effects. Pretreatment of GH reversed mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in an animal model of inflammatory pain. Clinical trials support GH treatment in a subgroup of patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (level of evidence: 1B+) or chronic lower back pain syndrome (level of evidence: 2C+).},

OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to investigate the impact of BBR on various cancers in healthy animals to promote the transformation from bench to bed. SEARCH METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Springer, and Cochrane databases were searched from January 2000 to October 2018 for relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Only published studies focusing on the relationship between BBR and various cancers in vivo were qualified. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each study, and any disagreement was resolved by discussion or by involving a third assessor. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies from 2000 to 2018, focusing on various cancer types, including breast cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lung cancer, gastric cancer, neuroepithelial cancer, endometrial carcinoma, esophageal cancer, tongue cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, and sarcoma were included. Overall, BBR reduced tumor volume (SMD =3.72, 95\% CI: 2.89, 4.56, Z = 8.73, p {\textless} 0.00001) and tumor weight (SMD =2.35, 95\% CI: 1.51, 3.19, Z = 5.50, p {\textless} 0.00001) in a linear The dose-response relationship (Pearson r = - 0.6717, p {\textless} 0.0001 in tumor volume analysis; Pearson r = - 0.7704, p {\textless} 0.0005 in tumor weight analysis). BBR inhibited angiogenesis in tumor tissues (SMD = 4.29, 95\% CI: 2.14, 6.44, Z = 3.92, p {\textless} 0.00001), but it had no significant effect on the body weight of experimental animals (SMD = 0.11, 95\% CI: - 0.70, 0.92, Z = 0.27, p = 0.78).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical studies suggest obesity paradoxically increases survival during bacterial infection and sepsis but decreases it with influenza, but these studies are observational. By contrast, animal studies of obesity in infection can prospectively compare obese versus nonobese controls. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of animal investigations to further examine obesity's survival effect in infection and sepsis. METHODS: Databases were searched for studies comparing survival in obese versus nonobese controls. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of animal investigations to further examine obesity's survival effect in infection and sepsis. Methods. Databases were searched for studies comparing survival in obese versus nonobese animals following bacteria, lipopolysaccharide, or influenza virus challenges. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies (761 obese and 603 control animals) met the inclusion criteria. Obesity reduced survival in 19 studies (11 significantly) and the odds ratio (95\% CI) of survival (0.21(0.13, 0.35); I (2) = 64\%, p {\textless} 0.01p {\textless} 0.01p {\textless} 0.01) but with high heterogeneity. Obesity reduced survival (1) consistently in both single-strain bacteria- and lipopolysaccharide-challenged studies (n = 6 studies, 0.21(0.13, 0.34); I (2) = 64\%, p {\textless} 0.01p {\textless} 0.01) but with high heterogeneity. Obesity reduced survival (1) consistently in both single-strain bacteria- and lipopolysaccharide-challenged studies (n = 6 studies, 0.21(0.13, 0.34); I (2) = 64\%, p {\textless} 0.01p {\textless} 0.01) but with high heterogeneity. Obesity reduced survival (1) consistently in both single-strain bacteria- and lipopolysaccharide-challenged studies (n = 6 studies, 0.21(0.13, 0.34); I (2) = 64\%, p {\textless} 0.01p {\textless} 0.01) but with high heterogeneity.

Obesity reduced survival (1) consistently in both single-strain bacteria- and lipopolysaccharide-challenged studies (n = 6 studies, 0.21(0.13, 0.34); I (2) = 31\%, p=0.20 and n = 5, 0.22(0.13, 0.36); I (2) = 0\%, p=0.59, respectively), (2) not significantly with cecal ligation and puncture (n = 4, 0.72(0.08, 6.23); I (2) = 75\%, p {\textless} 0.01), and (3) significantly with influenza but with high heterogeneity (n = 6, 0.12(0.04, 0.34); I (2) = 73\%, p {\textless} 0.01). Obesity's survival effects did not differ significantly comparing the four challenge types (p=0.49). Animal models did not include antimicrobials or glycemic control and study quality was low. CONCLUSIONS: Preclinical and clinical studies together emphasize the need for prospective studies in patients accurately assessing obesity's impact on survival during severe infection.},

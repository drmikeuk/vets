	abstract = {A systematic review of diagnostic tests based on radiologic measurements of structures in dogs and cats was done in order to reach generalizable conclusions about the value of making such measurements. Literature search was done using the ISI Web of KnowledgeSM for studies in the subject category Veterinary sciences. Studies were eligible for inclusion that employed length, angle, area or volume measurements from radiographic, ultrasonographic, CT or MR images of dogs or cats as a diagnostic test for a naturally occurring condition, compared the results of imaging with a reference standard, included at least 10 subjects, and sufficient data that a 2 x 2 table of results could be constructed. Quality of studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Twenty-six studies were found describing 40 tests that satisfied the inclusion criteria. Tests were radiographic in 22 (55\%) instances and ultrasonographic in 18 (45\%). Quality of studies was generally low, with a risk of bias in patient selection in 92\% studies, performance of the index test in 73\% studies, and patient flow in 42\% studies. Median (range) number of subjects was 64 (20-305), sensitivity was 77\% (38-99\%), specificity was 82\% (50-99\%), positive likelihood ratio was 4.1 (1-103), and negative likelihood ratio was 0.29 (0.01-1). Two studies that compared accuracy of radiographic measurements to subjective image interpretation alone found no difference. Evidence is weak that radiologic measurements of structures in dogs and cats are useful for diagnosis, hence measurements should not be emphasized as a basis for diagnosis in either teaching or clinical imaging reports.},

	abstract = {Companion-animal relinquishment is a worldwide phenomenon that leaves companion animals homeless. Knowing why humans make the decision to end their relationship with a companion-animal can help in our understanding of this complex societal issue and can help to develop preventive strategies. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to summarize reasons why dogs are surrendered, and determine if certain study characteristics were associated with the reported proportions of reasons for surrender. Articles investigating one or more reasons for dog surrender were selected from the references of a published scoping review. Two reviewers assessed the titles and abstracts of these articles, identifying 39 relevant articles. From these, 21 articles were further excluded because of ineligible study design, insufficient data available for calculating a proportion, or no data available for dogs. Data were extracted from 18 articles and meta-analysis was conducted on articles investigating reasons for dog surrender to a shelter (n=9) or dog surrender for euthanasia (n=5). Three studies were excluded from meta-analysis because they were duplicate populations. Other reasons for excluding studies from meta-analysis were, (1) the study only investigated reasons for dog re-relinquishment (n=2) and (2) the study sample size was {\textless}10 (n=1). Two articles investigated reasons for both dog surrender to a shelter and dog surrender for euthanasia. Results of meta-analysis found owner health/illness as a reason for dog surrender to a shelter had an overall estimate of 4.6\% (95\% CI: 4.1\%, 5.2\%). For all other identified reasons for surrender there was significant variation in methodology among studies preventing further meta-analysis. Univariable meta-regression was conducted to explore sources of variation among these studies. Country was identified as a significant source of variation (p{\textless}0.01) among studies reporting behavioural problems as a reason for dog surrender for euthanasia. The overall estimate for studies from Australia was 10\% (95\% CI: 8.0\%, 12.0\%; I2=15.5\%), compared to 16\% (95\% CI: 15.0\%, 18.0\%; I2=20.2\%) for studies from other countries. The present systematic review and meta-analysis highlights the need for further research and standardization of data collection to improve understanding of the reasons for dog relinquishment.},

Peer-reviewed studies reporting treatment of predominantly chondrodystrophic dogs with disc extrusion with loss of ambulation with either hemilaminectomy or conservative treatment (rest, analgesics and anti-inflammatories) were evaluated in a systematic review of the literature. Generally, the level of evidence available was low with no controlled studies and only case series available. In the meta-analysis, there was a clear trend to a greater proportion of dogs recovering and returning faster to ambulation for dogs treated with hemilaminectomy than for conservatively treated dogs. The mean proportions that recovered for neurological grades 3, 4 and 5 were 93, 93 and 61\% for those treated with hemilaminectomy, and 79, 62 and 10\% for those treated conservatively (Grade 3 – non-ambulatory paraparetic dogs; grade 4 – paraplegic dogs with intact deep pain perception; grade 5 – paraplegic dogs without intact deep pain perception). Due to the use of case series, these results represent between-study comparisons, thereby increasing the risk of selection bias and other biases. Data presented in this review support the current recommendations for surgical management of non-ambulatory dogs with disc-extrusion, but controlled clinical studies comparing outcomes are necessary to confirm these findings.},

	abstract = {Although in dairy cows the mammary gland (MG) is the major net user of essential AA (EAA) supply, milk protein synthesis from absorbed EAA is not a straightforward process. Early studies identified 2 groups of EAA based on different pattern of mammary utilization: group 1 [Met, Phe (+Tyr), Trp], where MG uptake was similar to secretion in milk protein, and group 2 (Arg, Ile, Leu, Lys, Thr, and Val), where uptake exceeded milk protein output. This review examines the validity of this classification under variable protein supply through a meta-analysis, with the outcomes then explained with studies in which the fates of individual EAA were monitored using isotope approaches. For the meta-analysis, the Fick principle, based on stoichiometric transfer of Phe+Tyr uptake to milk protein, was used to estimate mammary plasma flow across all studies. This approach was judged acceptable because doubling Phe supply did not result in mammary oxidation of Phe+Tyr and either limited or no contribution of peptides to Phe and Tyr mammary supply could be detected. The AA content of proteins synthesized by the MG was estimated from milk protein composition, and the uptake-to-output ratio (U:O) for individual AA was re-calculated based on these assumptions. Analysis of individual samples by isotopic dilution resulted in reduced variance compared with analysis on pooled samples performed with an AA analyzer. Globally, the U:O of His and Met is maintained close to unity under variable protein supply. The group 2 AA could be subdivided. First, the U:O for group "2v" AA (Ile, Leu, Val, and Lys) is greater than 1 and varied with protein supply. Accordingly, the increased U:O of Leu, induced by duodenal casein infusion, led to extra-mammary Leu oxidation. Decreasing Lys supply decreased Lys U:O and the associated transfer of N to non-EAA, mainly to Glx, Asx, Ser, and Ala. Second, the U:O of group "2nv" AA, Arg and Thr, does not vary with protein supply. The Arg U:O averages 2.5, whereas the Thr U:O, albeit averaging 1.2, does not differ from unity. Excess of both these AA is probably directed toward the synthesis of non-EAA rather than energy supply. Overall, the ability of the MG to use excess EAA-N supply offers alternative sources of N and C for energy provision, lactose synthesis and non-EAA synthesis. The latter function spares dietary non-EAA for other necessary processes, such as gluconeogenesis and energy supply, in other tissues to support lactation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bovine cysticercosis in Europe has been known for centuries but the data showing the occurrence of this zoonosis are scarce. The aim of this paper is to review and present the current knowledge on bovine cysticercosis in Europe. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies published between 1990 and November 2014. Qualitative and quantitative data on prevalence, risk factors, burden and interventions were extracted and analysed. RESULTS: Reports on prevalence were available for 23 European countries, mostly from western and central Europe; for a few of these only data before 1990 were available. Prevalence based on meat inspection was generally low (below 6.2 \% in 95 \% of the records) and varied between and within countries. Serology and detailed meat inspection provided a higher prevalence range (0.41-14 \%). Only few studies analysing risk factors were identified. Reported factors related to access to pastures and risky waters, dairy production and uncontrolled human defecation in the proximity of the farm among others. Only one estimate of the economic impact of the disease could be identified. Recommended interventions were focused on increasing diagnostic tests sensitivity or the application of risk based surveillance strategies. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of complete and updated data on most countries, especially in eastern Europe. Further risk factor studies might be needed together with estimates on the burden of the disease in all European countries. Risk-based interventions are being encouraged but current data are limited to guide this approach.},

Little research has documented the structure and effectiveness of such initiatives. This systematic review aimed to assess current published research pertaining to accessible health care, community-based veterinary medicine, and the use of community medicine in teaching programs. The review was an in-depth literature search identifying 51 publications relevant to the importance, benefits, drawbacks, and use of low-price and community clinics in underserved communities. These articles identified commonly discussed barriers to care that may prevent underserved clientele from seeking veterinary care. Five barriers were identified including the cost of veterinary care, accessibility of care, problems with or lack of veterinarian-client communication, culture/language, and lack of client education.

Six molecular epidemiology studies supported the transfer of resistance via whole bacterium transmission (WBT), which was best characterized among poultry in the Netherlands. Thirteen molecular epidemiology studies supported transmission of resistance via mobile genetic elements, which demonstrated greater diversity of geography and host FPA. Seventeen molecular epidemiology studies did not support WBT and two did not support mobile genetic element-mediated transmission. Four observational epidemiology studies were consistent with zoonotic transmission. Overall, there is evidence that a proportion of human extraintestinal ESCR-EC infections originate from FPAs. Poultry, in particular, is probably a source, but the quantitative and geographical extent of the problem is unclear and requires further investigation.},

	abstract = {Studies used to evaluate effects of dietary intervention on fertility may be subject to confounding because modification of one nutritional input requires a change in at least one other input. Meta-analytical modeling allows examination of a main intervention for a series of studies, but also an examination of a series of related effects through use of meta-regression. Effects of dietary crude protein (CP) on fertility were examined using this approach. We obtained 21 studies containing 32 comparisons that had pregnancy or conception data and met the eligibility criteria for meta-analysis of randomized controlled experiments providing information on diets used. Publications that contained data on prospective, randomized controlled experiments examining effects of dietary CP, either concentrations or degradability, or effects of a specific feed ingredient intervention on fertility were identified. Details on dietary formulation and diet intake were extracted from the publications, as were measures of urea in blood or plasma. Estimated fixed and random effects relative risks showed that risk of conception was lower in cows fed higher CP or more degradable CP diets (fixed effect (Mantel-Haenszel Relative Risk)=0.91 (95\% CI 0.84-0.98); \_P\_=0.019). This effect was homogenous (\_I\_²=0) and not influenced by difference in blood urea N, duration of intervention, breed, parity, milk production or type of diet delivery. Significant associations among CP components of the diet and carbohydrate fractions supported the hypothesized potential for confounding, but only the amount of soluble CP eaten was a significant meta-regression covariate that reduced risk of conception. There was no evidence that the significant reduction in fiber or non-fiber carbohydrate (NFC) fractions of the diets associated with increased concentration of CP, soluble CP or rumen degradable fractions or soyabean products content of the diet influenced conception rates. Results support findings of experiments showing that increased intake of soluble CP reduced conception rates, and provides strong evidence that increased concentrations of CP or increased degradability of CP, within the ranges evaluated in the studies contributing to this meta-analysis, reduce the risk of conception in lactating dairy cattle.},

	abstract = {Data from 137 published trials involving 2,545 calvings were analyzed using random effects normal logistic regression models to identify risk factors for clinical hypocalcemia in dairy cows. The aim of the study was to examine which form, if any, of the dietary cation anion difference (DCAD) equation provided the best estimate of milk fever risk and to clarify roles of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus concentrations of prepartum diets in the pathogenesis of milk fever. Two statistically equivalent and biologically plausible models were developed that predict incidence of milk fever. These models were validated using data from 37 trials excluded from the original data used to generate the models; missing variables were replaced with mean values from the analyzed data. The preferred models differed slightly; Model 1 included prepartum DCAD, and Model 2 included prepartum dietary concentrations of potassium and sulfur alone, but not sodium and chloride. Other factors, included in both models were prepartum dietary concentrations of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus; days exposed to the prepartum diet; and breed. Jersey cows were at 2.25 times higher risk of milk fever than Holstein cows in Model 1. The results support the DCAD theory of greater risk of milk fever with higher prepartum dietary DCAD (odds ratio = 1.015). The only DCAD equation supported in statistical analyses was (Na(+) + K(+)) – (Cl(-) + S(2-)). This finding highlights the difference between developing equations to predict DCAD and those to predict milk fever. The results support a hypothesis of a quadratic role for Ca in the pathogenesis of milk fever (model 1, odds ratio = 0.131; Model 2, odds ratio = 0.115). Milk fever risk was highest with a prepartum dietary concentration of 1.35\% calcium. Increasing prepartum dietary magnesium concentrations had the largest effect on decreasing incidence of milk fever in both Model 1 (odds ratio = 0.006) and Model 2 (odds ratio = 0.001). Increasing dietary phosphorus concentrations prepartum increased the risk of milk fever (Model 1, odds ratio = 6.376; Model 2, odds ratio = 9.872). The models presented provide the basis for the formulation of diets to reduce the risk of milk fever and strongly support the need to evaluate macro mineral nutrition apart from DCAD of the diet.},

Quantitative assessments can increase the statistical power with which we study the effect of treatments, such as biotin, on outcomes. A total of 9 papers, with 6 production and 3 hoof health studies, met the eligibility criteria for meta-analysis. Eight studies evaluated various hoof lesions in biotin-supplemented cows that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Eleven comparisons were made of milk production responses to biotin treatment. Data extracted included the number of cows in control and treatment groups, measures of variance of responses (standard error or standard deviation) and P-values. Other data obtained included the duration of treatment before and after calving, parity, breed of cow, type and dose of biotin, delivery method of supplementation, and types of diets. Biotin increased milk production by 1.29 kg per head per day (95\% confidence interval=0.35 to 2.18 kg) with no evidence of heterogeneity (I(2)=0.0\%). Treatment did not affect milk fat or protein percentages, and a trend to increase fat and protein yields was observed. Milk production and composition results were not influenced by duration of treatment before calving, parity, or diet type. Assessment of biotin supplementation on hoof health indicated that more studies had improved rather than negative or neutral outcomes. The effect of biotin treatment on milk production was relatively large and the effects on fat and protein yields, although not significant, were consistent in direction and magnitude with the milk response. The hoof health responses to biotin should encourage further studies to more effectively define the nature of these responses using consistent criteria for examination of hoof conditions and lameness.},

	abstract = {This study is a meta-analysis of the effects of the beta-agonists zilpaterol hydrochloride (ZH) and ractopamine hydrochloride (RAC) on feedlot performance, carcase characteristics of cattle and Warner Bratzler shear force (WBSF) of muscles. It was conducted to evaluate the effect of the use of these agents on beef production and meat quality and to provide data that would be useful in considerations on the effect of these agents on meat quality in Meat Standards Australia evaluations. We conducted a comprehensive literature search and study assessment using PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scirus, and CAB and identification of other studies from reference lists in papers and searches. Searches were based on the key words: zilpaterol, zilmax, ractopamine, optaflexx, cattle and beef. Studies from theses obtained were included. Data were extracted from more than 50 comparisons for both agents and analysed using meta-analysis and meta-regression. Both agents markedly increased weight gain, hot carcase weight and longissimus muscle area and increased the efficiency of gain:feed. These effects were particularly large for ZH, however, fat thickness was decreased by ZH, but not RAC. Zilpaterol also markedly increased WBSF by 1.2 standard deviations and more than 0.8 kg, while RAC increased WBSF by 0.43 standard deviations and 0.2 kg. There is evidence in the ZH studies, in particular, of profound re-partitioning of nutrients from fat to protein depots. This work has provided critically needed information on the effects of ZH and RAC on production, efficiency and meat quality.},

	abstract = {This review has a focus on understandings of horn structure, the digital fat pad and associations between ruminal acidosis and lameness. While there is an abundance of basic studies, particularly those examining putative mechanisms influencing risk of lameness and observational field studies, there are relatively few randomised controlled intervention studies. Consequently, the strength of the evidence for some interventions is not high. While there is evidence that increased grain feeding and increased ratios of non-fibre carbohydrates to neutral detergent fibre are associated with increased lameness, evidence for starch effects, per se, on laminitis is limited. There is strong evidence that fructans and glucose increase lactic acid production and laminitis. There is a need for more studies on the role of protein and risk of lameness. Histamine, endotoxin and lactic acid are either present in feed or generated in the rumen; can be absorbed; and have caused laminitis when injected. These provide potential links between ruminal acidosis and laminitis, but may not be the sole agents involved, and there are risks that these agents and other vasoactive agents pose that may be influenced by gut lesions. The important role of lipids in hoof wall integrity and in the digital hoof pad support understandings that trace elements and vitamins involved in pathways that control and limit oxidative damage may be important to hoof health. Further, associations between digital fat pad depth and body condition score suggest that dietary precursors for fats including preformed lipids in the diet and those derived from short chained fats may influence lameness. There is evidence that biotin reduces the risk of lameness, but there is a need for more consistent studies to identify which forms of lameness are reduced. Monensin and organic trace element complexes have reduced lameness in some studies, but the results are not consistently significant and more studies are needed to evaluate responses, especially effects on specific hoof conditions. The well-established effects of mineral nutrition on bone health were briefly examined, as were the effects of toxins. There is considerable scope for well-designed studies to evaluate the complex interactions among nutrients and the various forms of lameness.},

We conducted a systematic review of literature data linking water salinity and prevalence of the infection during the continental phase of Anguilla anguilla and A. rostrata. Overall, we showed a significant negative relationship across all sites (r[sub:S]=-0.42, n=77). In order to limit the effect of confounding factors (e.g. variable latitudes and parasite introduction dates), we performed a meta-analysis on the correlation coefficients calculated from data within studies (restricted period and area) and revealed a stronger negative relationship (r⁻=-0.75, n=13). Finally, using our long-term monitoring in a French Mediterranean lagoon, we documented a step decrease in both parasite prevalence and induced swimbladder pathologies in response to increased salinity values. Salinity effects manifested with an apparent threshold value around 15 per mil and are readily appreciable in young-of-the-year eels. To date, managing around water salinity parameters remains one of the best options to control the ever-expanding infection (both in aquaculture and in the wild) and to improve the quality of future spawners en route to the Sargasso Sea.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Risk of mortality in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI) in cats and dogs remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the incidence of mortality in cats and dogs with AKI based on etiology (i.e. infectious versus non-infectious; receiving dialysis versus conservative treatment). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and LILACS were searched up to July 2016. Articles were deemed eligible if they were case series studies evaluating the incidence of all-cause mortality in cats and dogs with AKI, regardless of etiology or the nature of treatment. RESULTS: Eighteen case series involving 1,201animalsproved eligible. The pooled proportions for overall mortality were: cats53.1\% [95\% CI 0.475, 0.586; I2 = 11,9\%, p = 0.3352]; dogs 45.0\% [95\% CI 0.33, 0.58; I2 = 91.5\%, P {\textless} 0.0001]. A non-significant increase in overall mortality risk was found among dialysed animals relative to those managed with conservative treatment, independent of animal type and the etiology of their AKI. The pooled proportions for overall mortality according to etiology, regardless of treatment type, were: AKI due infectious etiology for cats and dogs, 19.2\% [95\% CI 0.134, 0.258; I2 = 37.7\%, P = 0.0982]; AKI due non-infectious etiology for cats and dogs, 59.9\% [95\% CI 0.532, 0.663; I2 = 51.0\%, P = 0.0211]. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest higher rates of overall mortality in cats and dogs with AKI due to non-infectious etiologies relative to infectious etiologies, and showed non-significant differences in terms of higher rates associated with dialysis compared to conservative management. Further investigations regarding optimal time to initiate dialysis and the development of clinical models to prognosticate the course of disease and guide optimal treatment initiation for less severe cases of AKI in cats and dogs is warranted.},

	abstract = {A recent shortage of prepackaged heparinized saline (HS) syringes has led to the question of whether or not normal saline (NS) can be used to both flush and lock IV catheters in large animal medicine (LAM). Moreover, several known medication incompatibilities exist with IV heparin administration. This is of particular concern in veterinary medicine where limited to no compatibility data exists between "veterinary only" (non-Food and Drug Administration approved) medications and heparin. Most of the literature on this subject is in human medicine where flushing of peripheral IV lines (PIVL) is done safely and effectively with NS. The jugular lines inserted in LAM have characteristics that are more similar to PIVLs versus most central venous access devices used in human patients. In addition, LAM catheters are of larger diameter than those typically used in human medicine thereby reducing the risk of occlusion. Based on the data evaluated, flushing and locking all LAM catheters with of NS is a reasonable alternative method for maintaining IV patency and eliminating problems associated with medication-related incompatibilities or shortages of prepackaged HS syringes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trypanosomosis is a haemoprotozoan disease, mostly transmitted by the tsetse fly (Glossina spp.), it causes severe disease in humans and animals in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The disease results in loss of livestock and agricultural productivity with severe socio-economic impacts. In Ethiopia, bovine trypanosomosis is widely distributed in western and south-western parts of the country. It is estimated that some 10 to 14 million heads of cattle in Ethiopia are exposed to the risk of trypanosomosis. METHODS: This study describes the prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis in Ethiopia through a meta-analysis. A comprehensive search was conducted on PubMed and non-PubMed indexed articles were also incorporated based on expert suggestion. Eligible studies were selected by using inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pooled prevalence was estimated by random effect model. Publication bias and the variation in prevalence estimates attributed to heterogeneity were also assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies with relevant prevalence data were identified and included in the analysis. The apparent prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis varied from 1.38 to 17.15 \%. The pooled estimate of bovine trypanosomosis prevalence across studies for the entire period was 8.12 \% (95 \% CI: 6.88; 9.35), ranging from 10.27 \% (95 \% CI: 7.34; 13.20) in the late 1990s and early 2000s, to 6.81 \% (95 \% CI: 5.00; 8.62) after 2010. Sub-analysis by region revealed wide variations in prevalence. The highest estimated regional prevalence was 13.30 \% (95 \% CI: 7.73; 18.88) in Benishangul Gumuz Regional state. A high degree of heterogeneity was observed in most pooled estimates and even after sub-group analysis. The visual inspection of the funnel plot and the Egger's regression asymmetry coefficient [b = 2.18] (95 \% CI = -1.09, 5.46; p {\textgreater} 0.05) did not suggest the presence of publication bias. T. congolense and T. vivax were reported to be the predominant causative agents. From the total positive animals, 45.5 and 44.3 \% of the infections are accounted to T. congolense and T. vivax, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis showed a significant reduction in prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis in recent years, but the reduction is not to the lowest necessary level. Since T. vivax is reported to be one of the most important trypanosome species involved, efforts should also be made to control the mechanical transmission by biting flies.},

In this study, we adopted FNDF to RDS ratio (CBI[sub:R]) or their intake difference (CBI[sub:D]) as carbohydrate balance indexes (CBI), and evaluated their regression relationship to the ruminal pH, fermentation characteristics, milk fat and feed efficiency. The results revealed that the CBI[sub:R] and CBI[sub:D] showed strong linear or quadratic correlation with the dependent variables.

Recently, studies have shown that people in contact with livestock may have a greater chance of MRSA carriage. We aimed to establish the prevalence of MRSA among people in contact with livestock and review the factors influencing MRSA carriage. METHODS: We systematically examined published epidemiologic studies on MRSA prevalence in people in contact with livestock using Pubmed, Medline, Embase, Ovid, and the Cochrane Library. Prevalence estimates were pooled using a random-effects model. Study heterogeneity was assessed using Q statistics and quantified with I2 statistics. RESULTS: Thirty-three eligible studies were included in this systematic review. Prevalence of MRSA ranged from 0.0\%-85.8\%. The pooled prevalence estimate of MRSA was 14.2\% (95\% confidence interval, 9.1\%-20.1\%) for people in contact with livestock. Substantial heterogeneity in eligible studies was noted (chi2 = 1,025; P {\textless} .001; I2 = 96.9\%). Subgroup analysis showed the prevalence of MRSA was high in people from Europe (15.9\%), farmers (18.2\%), and by longitudinal study design (38.9\%). Animal contact and intensity of animal contact were associated with increased risk of MRSA carriage. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that there may be transmission of MRSA between animals and humans.},

Therefore, a review of the overall efficiency for the developmental competence of embryos produced by these in vitro methods would be useful in order to obtain a more thorough overview of this growing area with respect to its development and present status. In this review a meta-analysis was used to analyse data collected from all published articles with a focus on zygotes and embryos for transfer, pregnancy, full-term development and piglets born. It was generally concluded that an increasing level of in vitro manipulation of porcine embryos decreased the overall efficiency for production of piglets. The techniques of nuclear transfer have been developed markedly through the increasing number of studies performed, and the results have become more stable. Prolonged in vitro culture period did not lead to any negative effect on nuclear transfer embryos after their transfer and it resulted in a similar or even higher litter size. More complete information is needed in future scientific articles about these in vitro manipulation techniques to establish a more solid basis for the evaluation of their status and to reveal and further investigate any eventual problems.},

Results showed that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) approaches were effective in estimating the overall CH4 and N2O emission levels from swine operations, but the variation of the measured emissions is not adequately captured. An overestimation by the IPCC approaches for CH4 emissions was observed for swine buildings with pit systems in European studies and the average percentage relative difference (PRD) between the measured and the IPCC values is -21.1\%. The observed CH4 emissions from lagoons were lower than the IPCC estimated values and the average PRD is -33.9\%. In North American studies the observed N2O emission factors for swine buildings with pit systems were significantly lower than the IPCC default values, while in European studies they were significantly higher than the IPCC default values. The measured CH4 and N2O emissions were significantly affected by stage of production (P = 0.05 and {\textless} 0.01, respectively) and geographic regions (P = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively). The IPCC approaches were effective in simulating the effect of temperature on CH4 emissions from outdoor slurry storage facilities, while they could overestimate CH4 emissions from lagoons at low temperatures. The CH4 emissions from pits inside swine buildings were not significantly affected by average ambient temperatures. A positive relationship between diet CP content and CH4 emissions was confirmed in the meta-analysis. The obtained knowledge can be helpful in efforts to improve estimation of GHG emissions from swine operations.},

	abstract = {In the UK, it has been suggested that abattoirs are ideal locations to assess the welfare of sheep as most are slaughtered at abattoirs either as finished lambs or cull ewes. Data from abattoirs could provide benchmarks for welfare indicators at a national level, as well as demonstrating how these change over time. Additionally, feedback could be provided to farmers and regulatory authorities to help improve welfare and identify high or low standards for quality assurance or risk-based inspections. A systematic review of the scientific literature was conducted, which identified 48 animal-based indicators of sheep welfare that were categorised by the Five Freedoms. Their validity as measures of welfare and feasibility for use in abattoirs were evaluated as potential measures of prior sheep welfare on the farm of origin, at market, or during transportation to the abattoir. A total of 19 indicators were considered valid, of which nine were considered theoretically feasible for assessing sheep welfare at abattoirs; these were body cleanliness, carcass bruising, diarrhoea, skin lesions, skin irritation, castration, ear notching, tail docking and animals recorded as 'obviously sick'. Further investigation of these indicators is required to test their reliability and repeatability in abattoirs. Novel welfare indicators are needed to assess short-term hunger and thirst, prior normal behaviour and long-term fear and distress.},

Data from 215 measures of AOL and 209 measures of EGC, from 65,174 animals, extracted from 36 papers published between 1985 and 2006 were used. The Restricted Maximum Likelihood Method and an animal model that considered AOL and EGC as functions of the fixed effects of country from where the data come from; animal category; feed system; measure methodology; \_Bos indicus\_, british and continental \_Bos taurus\_ gene contribution; age and weight at measure, were used. The observed averages for AOL and e EGC were 63.5 cm² and 4.2 mm, respectively. The animals were in average 552.22 days old at the measure of the characteristics and had 468.47 kg of live weight. The use of meta-analysis permitted to get generalized conclusions about AOL and EGC: animals rose in the EUA presented values significantly superior for AOL and EGC when compared with those rose in Australia and Brazil; castrated and the entire males presented bigger AOL measures (do not differing among them) compared to females, and females presented bigger EGC. The feed system, confined and do not confined, were superior to the greasing system. The Continental \_Bos taurus\_ genotypes presented bigger AOL values, British \_Bos taurus\_ presented bigger EGC values, and \_Bos indicus\_ presented intermediate values. The measures taken in the carcass (pos mortis) and by ultra son (in vivo) were not different. The increase in the characteristics decreased with the age and live weight increase.},

Inclusion criteria for the publications were: comparison of at least two groups of animals of different categories of BCS or change (independent variables) and consideration of pregnancy rate at first AI or number of days open (dependent variables). Fifteen papers were selected and 23 excluded. Data corresponding to 7733 cows from 11 studies described in 10 papers were included in the analysis of pregnancy rate at first AI, and those derived from 4529 cows from 11 studies described in 10 papers were used to analyze effects on the number of days open. Analyses were stratified according to study design and milk production characteristics. We defined low, intermediate and high categories of BCS for values lower than 2.5, from 2.5 to 3.5, or higher than 3.5, respectively. The categories of body condition change were increase (gain in score), slight loss (0-0.5 point loss), moderate loss (0.6-1 point loss), and severe loss (over 1 unit loss). Intermediate body condition at parturition and at first AI, and a slight loss during the early lactation period were used as reference categories. The effects of body condition on the variable pregnancy rate at first AI were highly heterogeneous, while all the studies considering the number of days open presented homogeneous results. A clear association between body condition category and pregnancy rate at first AI was detected only when the effect of a low score at parturition was analyzed: pregnancy rate at first AI significantly decreased by about 10\% in cows delivering in poor condition. Animals with a high BCS at parturition showed a significant reduction in the number of days open of 5.8 or 11.7 when compared with animals with an intermediate or low body condition, respectively. In animals in the high body condition category at first AI, the variable days open showed a significant drop of 11.9 or 24.1, compared to animals in the intermediate or low categories, respectively. A severe loss in score during early lactation was related to a significant (10.6) increase in the number of days open, while a slight or moderate body condition change, either loss or gain in score, was not significantly related to the variable days open. We found that the number of days open was a good indicator of the effects of BCS or change in score on reproductive performance in dairy cattle. The variable pregnancy rate at first AI, however, yielded heterogeneous results among studies.},

A systematic review was carried out, which identified 72 cattle welfare indicators (CWI) that were classified into four categories (physiological, morphometric, behavioral and meat quality). Their validity and feasibility for use in abattoirs were evaluated as potential measures of cattle welfare during transportation to the abattoir and at the abattoir itself. Several highly valid indicators were identified that are useful to assess welfare at abattoirs, including body condition score, human-animal interactions, vocalizations, falling, carcass bruising, and meat pH. In addition, some intermediate valid indicators are useful and should be investigated further. Information along the food chain could be used systematically to provide a basis for a more-risk-based meat inspection. An integrated system based on the use of key indicators defined for each inspection step with the setting of alarm thresholds could be implemented.},

Free-ranging domestic cats have been introduced globally and have contributed to multiple wildlife extinctions on islands. The magnitude of mortality they cause in mainland areas remains speculative, with large-scale estimates based on non-systematic analyses and little consideration of scientific data. Here we conduct a systematic review and quantitatively estimate mortality caused by cats in the United States. We estimate that free-ranging domestic cats kill 1.4-3.7 billion birds and 6.9-20.7 billion mammals annually. Un-owned cats, as opposed to owned pets, cause the majority of this mortality. Our findings suggest that free-ranging cats cause substantially greater wildlife mortality than previously thought and are likely the single greatest source of anthropogenic mortality for US birds and mammals. Scientifically sound conservation and policy intervention is needed to reduce this impact.},

	abstract = {Based on results of cell studies and animal experiments, clinical trials with Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) were performed, which finally did not demonstrate a beneficial effect on outcome of wound healing. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the evidence from cell studies and animal experiments with respect to wound healing was unequivocally in favour of LLLT, which would imply that these models might be adequate to predict treatment response in patients, or that the data of cell studies and animal experiments were inconclusive, which would mean that the clinical trials were based on insufficient evidence. We performed a systematic review of cell studies and animal experiment with LLLT on wound healing. Manuscripts were identified by searching Medline, Embase, and SPIE (the International Society for Optical Engineering). We assessed whether studies showed a beneficial effect of active treatment or not. The effect size was expressed in standardised mean difference [(SMD) the mean outcome measure of the treatment group minus the mean outcome measure of the control group, divided by the pooled standard deviation of these measurements]. In-depth analyses were performed on (1) studies in which inflicted wounds on animals were irradiated and evaluated; (2) studies with primary outcome measures on dimensions with direct reference to wound healing (ranging from acceleration of wound closure to epithelialisation, but excluding surrogate dimensions with regard to wound healing; in this case: tensile strength); (3) animal studies with 'true controls'; (4) studies in which animals functioned as their 'own controls' and (5) studies with the highest methodological quality score. The 36 included studies contained 49 outcome parameters of which 30 reported a positive effect of laser irradiation and 19 did not. Eleven studies presented exact data about the effect of active treatment and controls. The pooled effect size (SMD) over 22 outcome measures of these studies was – 1.05 (95\% Cl: – 1.67 to – 0.43) in favour of LLLT. Methodological quality of the studies was poor. In-depth analysis of studies showed no significant pooled effect size in studies with highest methodological quality scores [0.06 (95\% CI:- 0.42 to 0.53)]. Summarising the data of cell studies and animal experiments, reviewed in this manuscript, these studies failed to show unequivocal evidence to substantiate the decision for trials with LLLT in a large number of patients. In fact, there were no differences between the results of these experiments and clinical studies. Remarkably, we found that (almost from the introduction on) animal experiments and clinical studies that address the biological effects of LLLT on wound healing, ran simultaneously, rather than in sequence. We conclude that this type of phototherapy should not be considered a valuable (adjuvant) treatment for this selected, generally therapy-refractory condition in humans.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that the widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides threatens bees, but research on this topic has been surrounded by controversy. In order to synthesize which research approaches have been used to examine the effect of neonicotinoids on bees and to identify knowledge gaps, we systematically reviewed research on this subject that was available on the Web of Science and PubMed in June 2015. Most of the 216 primary research studies were conducted in Europe or North America (82\%), involved the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (78\%), and concerned the western honey bee Apis mellifera (75\%). Thus, little seems to be known about neonicotinoids and bees in areas outside Europe and North America. Furthermore, because there is considerable variation in ecological traits among bee taxa, studies on honey bees are not likely to fully predict impacts of neonicotinoids on other species. Studies on crops were dominated by seed-treated maize, oilseed rape (canola) and sunflower, whereas less is known about potential side effects on bees from the use of other application methods on insect pollinated fruit and vegetable crops, or on lawns and ornamental plants. Laboratory approaches were most common, and we suggest that their capability to infer real-world consequences are improved when combined with information from field studies about realistic exposures to neonicotinoids. Studies using field approaches often examined only bee exposure to neonicotinoids and more field studies are needed that measure impacts of exposure. Most studies measured effects on individual bees. We suggest that effects on the individual bee should be linked to both mechanisms at the sub-individual level and also to the consequences for the colony and wider bee populations. As bees are increasingly facing multiple interacting pressures future research needs to clarify the role of neonicotinoids in relative to other drivers of bee declines.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Yew plant materials contain highly toxic taxine alkaloids. Serious ingestions can result in life-threatening toxicity. The purpose of this article is to summarize the literature on the treatment of acute yew poisoning. DATA SOURCES: PubMed (January 1946 to November 2017) was searched using the search terms "taxus/po". EMBASE (1980 to November 2017) was searched using the search terms "taxus/to" and "yew.mp." Web of Science (1945 to November 2017) was searched using the text words taxus, taxine, and yew. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Available English language articles involving case reports, epidemiology, treatment, and outcomes were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Although not uncommon, unintentional yew poisoning rarely results in significant morbidity or mortality. A total of 26 case reports of yew poisoning were evaluated along with 4 case series articles (totaling 22 additional cases). Only 4 of the 48 total cases (8\%) were accidental poisonings, the rest being deliberate ingestions. In 20 patients (42\%), it resulted in fatalities. Severe, acute yew poisoning results in symptomatology largely resistant to pharmacotherapy intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Most nonintentional ingestions of yew plant constituents are asymptomatic and require little intervention. Severe poisoning can result in life-threatening cardiac toxicity and require aggressive supportive care. Therapeutic interventions, such as sodium bicarbonate, digoxin immune fab, and hemodialysis that have been utilized in case studies and case series in the literature have little proven benefit. Extracorporeal life support should be considered in severe yew poisoning.},

AIM OF THE REVIEW: We intend to discuss the current knowledge about the traditional uses, and the newest phytochemical and pharmacological achievements with tentative elucidation of the mechanism of action on the genus Polygala covering the period 2013-2019 to provide a scientific support to the traditional uses, and to critically analyze the reported studies to obtain new insights for further researches. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data were systematically collected from the scientific electronic data bases including SciFinder, Scopus, Elsevier, PubMed and Google Scholar. RESULTS: This literature overview reported several traditional uses of different species of Polygala, mainly against wounds, inflammation, cardiovascular and central nervous system disorders. P. altomontana, P caudata, P. flavescens, P. glomerata, P. japonica, P. molluginifolia, P. sibirica, P. tenuifolia are the main species which have been studied in the last few years. Phytochemical studies showed that they contain triterpene saponins, triterpenes, terpenoids, xanthones, flavonoids, coumarins, oligosaccharide esters, styryl-pyrones, benzophenones, and polysaccharides. Pharmacological in vitro and in vivo studies and proposal of the mechanisms of action indicated that pure constituents and extracts of Polygala ssp exhibited significant anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antiischemic, antidepressant, sedative, analgesic, antiatherosclerosis, antitumor and enzyme inhibitory properties. CONCLUSION: This review on traditional uses and phytopharmacological potential of the genus Polygala revealed updated insights which can be explored for further mechanism-based pharmacological activities and structure/activity relationships studies and a better comprehension of the development of Chinese medicine preparations. However some pharmacological studies showed several gaps such as incomplete methodologies and ambiguous findings. More high scientific quality preclinical studies with pharmacokinetic considerations will be required in the future to assess the traditional uses of some species of this genus. This might lead to efficacy and safety issues in clinical trials and to potential medicinal applications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) lead to drastic metabolic alterations with associated energy balance and body weight changes, two related physiological processes regulated by the brain. Polyphenol-based treatments for NCDs have emerged as a promising therapy, which seems to involve the energy balance modulation. However, it remains unclear what the most effective polyphenols-based treatment is to attenuate adverse effects in the energy balance of NCDs. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the literature on the metabolic and neurological effects of polyphenols-based treatment in rodent models of NCDs. METHODS: Literature search was carried out in the following databases: CINAHL, Medline/PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science. For title and abstract screening, original papers with polyphenols exposure in rodents were selected. For full-text screening, studies with models of NCDs that reported metabolic and neurological outcomes when treated with polyphenols were selected for inclusion in this review. RESULTS: 23 articles, using individual compound (11 articles) or polyphenols extracts (12 articles), were included in this review: 5 articles using tea polyphenols, 12 articles using grape-derived polyphenols, 3 articles using the polyphenol quercetin, and 3 articles using other polyphenol sources. Most results agree on the beneficial effect of polyphenols in attenuating alterations in energy balance and body weight. Such effects were associated with neuroprotective responses in different brain areas including hippocampus and hypothalamus. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this review shows that the treatment with polyphenols, especially resveratrol or quercetin, attenuates the adverse effects of NCDs on energy balance and are associated with neuroprotective effects.},

Pigs are described as the main amplifying host, but their role in JE epidemiology needs to be reassessed in order to identify and implement efficient control strategies, for both human and animal health. We aimed to provide a systematic review of publications linked to JE in swine, in terms of both individual and population characteristics of JE virus (JEV) infection and circulation, as well as observed epidemiological patterns. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement to select and analyze relevant articles from the Scopus database, 127 of which were included in the review. Pigs are central, but the implication of secondary hosts cannot be ruled out and should be further investigated. Although human vaccination cannot eradicate the virus, it is clearly the most important means of preventing human disease. However, a better understanding of the actual involvement of domestic pigs as well as other potential JEV hosts in different JEV epidemiological cycles and patterns could help to identify additional/complementary control measures, either by targeting pigs or not, and in some specific epidemiological contexts, contribute to reduce virus circulation and protect humans from JEV infection.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dementia is a chronic condition which progressively affects memory and other cognitive functions, social behaviour, and ability to carry out daily activities. To date, no treatment is clearly effective in preventing progression of the disease, and most treatments are symptomatic, often aiming to improve people's psychological symptoms or behaviours which are challenging for carers. A range of new therapeutic strategies has been evaluated in research, and the use of trained animals in therapy sessions, termed animal-assisted therapy (AAT), is receiving increasing attention. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of animal-assisted therapy for people with dementia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register on 5 September 2019. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of major healthcare databases, trial registries, and grey literature sources. We also searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), ISI Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO's trial registry portal. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised trials, and randomised cross-over trials that compared AAT versus no AAT, AAT using live animals versus alternatives such as robots or toys, or AAT versus any other active intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data using the standard methods of Cochrane Dementia. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of the retrieved records. We expressed our results using mean difference (MD), standardised mean difference (SMD), and risk ratio (RR) with their 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine RCTs from 10 reports. All nine studies were conducted in Europe and the US. Six studies were parallel-group, individually randomised RCTs; one was a randomised cross-over trial; and two were cluster-RCTs that were possibly related where randomisation took place at the level of the day care and nursing home. We identified two ongoing trials from trial registries. There were three comparisons: AAT versus no AAT (standard care or various non-animal-related activities), AAT using live animals versus robotic animals, and AAT using live animals versus the use of a soft animal toy. The studies evaluated 305 participants with dementia. One study used horses and the remainder used dogs as the therapy animal. The duration of the intervention ranged from six weeks to six months, and the therapy sessions lasted between 10 and 90 minutes each, with a frequency ranging from one session every two weeks to two sessions per week. There was a wide variety of instruments used to measure the outcomes. All studies were at high risk of performance bias and unclear risk of selection bias. Our certainty about the results for all major outcomes was very low to moderate. Comparing AAT versus no AAT, participants who received AAT may be slightly less depressed after the intervention (MD -2.87, 95\% CI -5.24 to -0.50; 2 studies, 83 participants; low-certainty evidence), but they did not appear to have improved quality of life (MD 0.45, 95\% CI -1.28 to 2.18; 3 studies, 164 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There were no clear differences in all other major outcomes, including social functioning (MD -0.40, 95\% CI -3.41 to 2.61; 1 study, 58 participants; low-certainty evidence), problematic behaviour (SMD -0.34, 95\% CI -0.98 to 0.30; 3 studies, 142 participants; very-low-certainty evidence), agitation (SMD -0.39, 95\% CI -0.89 to 0.10; 3 studies, 143 participants; very-low-certainty evidence), activities of daily living (MD 4.65, 95\% CI -16.05 to 25.35; 1 study, 37 participants; low-certainty evidence), and self-care ability (MD 2.20, 95\% CI -1.23 to 5.63; 1 study, 58 participants; low-certainty evidence). There were no data on adverse events. Comparing AAT using live animals versus robotic animals, one study (68 participants) found mixed effects on social function, with longer duration of physical contact but shorter duration of talking in participants who received AAT using live animals versus robotic animals (median: 93 seconds with live versus 28 seconds with robotic for physical contact; 164 seconds with live versus 206 seconds with robotic for talk directed at a person; 263 seconds with live versus 307 seconds with robotic for talk in total). Another study showed no clear differences between groups in behaviour measured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (MD -6.96, 95\% CI -14.58 to 0.66; 78 participants; low-certainty evidence) or quality of life (MD -2.42, 95\% CI -5.71 to 0.87; 78 participants; low-certainty evidence). There were no data on the other outcomes. Comparing AAT using live animals versus a soft toy cat, one study (64 participants) evaluated only social functioning, in the form of duration of contact and talking. The data were expressed as median and interquartile ranges. Duration of contact was slightly longer in participants in the AAT group and duration of talking slightly longer in those exposed to the toy cat. This was low-certainty evidence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found low-certainty evidence that AAT may slightly reduce depressive symptoms in people with dementia. We found no clear evidence that AAT affects other outcomes in this population, with our certainty in the evidence ranging from very-low to moderate depending on the outcome. We found no evidence on safety or effects on the animals. Therefore, clear conclusions cannot yet be drawn about the overall benefits and risks of AAT in people with dementia. Further well-conducted RCTs are needed to improve the certainty of the evidence. In view of the difficulty in achieving blinding of participants and personnel in such trials, future RCTs should work on blinding outcome assessors, document allocation methods clearly, and include major patient-important outcomes such as affect, emotional and social functioning, quality of life, adverse events, and outcomes for animals.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To appraise the available animal and human studies investigating low-intensity pulsed ultrasound stimulation (LIPUS) on tendon, ligament, and bone-soft tissue (B-ST) junction healing. METHODS: A systematic review of PUBMED, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library was performed for animal and human studies investigating the effects of LIPUS on tendon, ligament, and B-ST junction healing. The systematic search was performed using the key term "low intensity pulsed ultrasound" and any of the following: "tendon," "ligament," "tendon-bone," and "bone-tendon." Inclusion criteria consisted of (1) randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of LIPUS on bone, tendon, and soft tissue in animals or humans and (2) English-language articles. RESULTS: A total of 28 animal and 2 human studies met inclusion criteria. Animal studies utilized various models, including Achilles and patellar tendon transections, medial collateral ligament transections, and surgical repair of patellar tendon, rotator cuff tendon, and anterior cruciate ligament, to evaluate the effects of LIPUS. Animal studies demonstrated significantly improved collagen content and organization, bone formation, fibrocartilage remodeling, and mechanical strength with LIPUS treatment compared with controls. In human trials, LIPUS treatment of chronic tendinopathies did not improve clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In acute injury animal models, LIPUS augmented healing of acute tendon, ligament, and B-ST junction injuries through increased collagen content and organization; increased anti-inflammatory cellular signaling; and increased angiogenesis. However, in 2 human studies investigating chronic tendinopathy, LIPUS did not lead to superior outcomes compared with controls. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Animal models suggest that LIPUS may be a promising noninvasive treatment modality for accelerating patient recovery after acute tendon and ligament injuries, as well as after surgical repair of B-ST junction injuries, but this has not been demonstrated in human studies. Randomized clinical trials evaluating LIPUS for acute tendon and ligament injuries are warranted.},

	abstract = {Scientists have long predicted the impacts of climate-related infectious disease emergence. Yet, the combined effect of local socioeconomic and demographic factors and weather variation on child health is poorly understood. With a focus on childhood diarrhoea caused by the parasite Cryptosporidium spp., - an infection easily controlled by public health interventions but also strongly linked to environmental conditions through waterborne spread, we systematically review and empirically model the effects of local weather and flooding history, after controlling for seasonality, publication bias, access to improved sanitation, health resources and population density at a global scale. We examined 1588 papers on childhood cryptosporidiosis and identified 36 studies representing a range of geographic locations and climatic, environmental and socio-economic conditions. Local rainfall and population density were related with cryptosporidiosis across latitudes as shown by mixed effects, spatio-temporal models for equatorial, sub-tropical and temperate climates. In equatorial (0-20°) latitudes, the previous month's rainfall and population density were inversely related with childhood cryptosporidiosis with a significant random effect for flooding history. In tropical-subtropical (20-35°) latitudes, rainfall in December was inversely related with cryptosporidiosis, compared to rainfall in April (the wet season). In temperate latitudes ({\textgreater}35°), there was a significant negative association of reported disease with population density. This global empirical analysis indicates differential spatio-temporal patterns of childhood cryptosporidiosis in low, mid and high latitude regions. Models that couple weather conditions with demographic factors are needed to assess disease distributional shifts and risks due to environmental change. These results may provide impetus to develop environment-focused public health policies to manage disease risks associated with climate change for future generations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to conduct a systematic review of preclinical and clinical evidence to chart the successful trajectory of talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) from the bench to the clinic. DESIGN: This study was a systematic review. The primary outcome of interest was the efficacy of treatment, determined by complete response. Abstract and full-text selection as well as data extraction were done by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias in studies. SETTING: Embase, Embase Classic and OvidMedline were searched from inception until May 2016 to assess its development trajectory to approval in 2015. PARTICIPANTS: Preclinical and clinical controlled comparison studies, as well as observational studies. INTERVENTIONS: T-VEC for the treatment of any malignancy. RESULTS: 8852 records were screened and five preclinical (n=150 animals) and seven clinical studies (n=589 patients) were included. We saw large decreases in T-VEC's efficacy as studies moved from the laboratory to patients, and as studies became more methodologically rigorous. Preclinical studies reported complete regression rates up to 100\% for injected tumours and 80\% for contralateral tumours, while the highest degree of efficacy seen in the clinical setting was a 24\% complete response rate, with one study experiencing a complete response rate of 0\%. We were unable to reliably assess safety due to the lack of reporting, as well as the heterogeneity seen in adverse event definitions. All preclinical studies had high or unclear risk of bias, and all clinical studies were at a high risk of bias in at least one domain. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings illustrate that even successful biotherapeutics may not demonstrate a clear translational road map. This emphasises the need to consider increasing rigour and transparency along the translational pathway. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42016043541.},

We conducted a systematic literature review to assess the relation between AHC and anemia among women of reproductive age, school-aged children, and children aged {\textless}5 y in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We used a 2-stage screening process, in which 1 reviewer searched 4 databases (PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Global Health) with predetermined search terms for relevant articles. Two reviewers then independently screened studies using a priori exclusion criteria, yielding a total of 23 articles included in the final review. We evaluated evidence from observational studies assessing animal-dependent livelihoods and livestock ownership, and interventions that promoted livestock and fish production. We found little consistency in anemia outcomes across the several AHC exposures and population groups. Poultry production interventions had modest benefits on anemia among women and children, although whether these improvements were a result of increased ASF consumption, or a result of the combined treatment study design could not be determined. Observational studies identified chicken ownership, and no other livestock species, as a risk factor for anemia among young children. However, there was limited evidence to evaluate pathways underlying these associations. Studies tended to rely on self-reported fever and diarrhea to assess illness, and no study directly assessed linkages between AHC, pathogen burden, and anemia. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether AHC improves or worsens anemia among women and children in LMICs. Given the current interest in promoting animal production among low-income households, future studies with robust measures of livestock ownership, ASF consumption, pathogen burden, and anemia status are needed to understand the nuances of this complex and potentially contradictory relation.},

OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) resulting in motor deficits can be devastating injuries resulting in millions of health care dollars spent per incident. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a potential class of drugs that could improve motor function after an SCI. This systematic review utilizes PRISMA guidelines to evaluate the effectiveness of NSAIDs for SCI. METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Embase, and Scopus were reviewed linking the keywords of "ibuprofen," "meloxicam," "naproxen," "ketorolac," "indomethacin," "celecoxib," "ATB-346," "NSAID," and "nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug" with "spinal." Results were reviewed for relevance and included if they met inclusion criteria. The SYRCLE checklist was used to assess sources of bias. RESULTS: A total of 2960 studies were identified in the PubMed/MEDLINE database using the above-mentioned search criteria. A total of 461 abstracts were reviewed in Scopus, 340 in CINAHL, 179 in PsycINFO, and 7632 in Embase. A total of 15 articles met the inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: NSAIDs' effectiveness after SCI is largely determined by its ability to inhibit Rho-A. NSAIDs are a promising therapeutic option in acute SCI patients because they appear to decrease cord edema and inflammation, increase axonal sprouting, and improve motor function with minimal side effects. Studies are limited by heterogeneity, small sample size, and the use of animal models, which might not replicate the therapeutic effects in humans. There are no published human studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of these drugs after a traumatic cord injury. There is a need for well-designed prospective studies evaluating ibuprofen or indomethacin after adult spinal cord injuries.},

	abstract = {Inflammatory disorders like diabetes, systemic lupus erythematodes, inflammatory lung diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, but also rejection of transplanted organs and GvHD, form a major burden of disease. Current classes of immune suppressive drugs to treat these disorders are never curative and side effects are common. Therefore there is a need for new drugs with improved and more targeted modes of action. Potential candidates are the DNA methyl transferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine (Aza) and its derivative 5-aza 2'deoxycitidine (DAC). Aza and DAC have been tested in several pre-clinical in vivo studies. In order to obtain an overview of disorders for which Aza and/or DAC can be a potential treatment, and to find out where information is lacking, we systematically reviewed pre-clinical animal studies assessing Aza or DAC as a potential therapy for distinct inflammatory disorders. Also, study quality and risk of bias was systematically assessed. In the 35 identified studies, we show that both Aza and DAC do not only seem to be able to alleviate a number of inflammatory disorders, but also prevent solid organ rejection and GvHD in in vivo pre-clinical animal models. Aza/DAC are known to upregulate FOXP3, a master transcription factor for Treg, in vitro. Seventeen studies described the effect on Treg, of which 16 studies showed an increase in Treg. Increasing Treg therefore seems to be a common mechanism in preventing inflammatory disorders by Aza/DAC. We also found, however, that many essential methodological details were poorly reported leading to an unclear risk of bias. Therefore, reported effects might be an overestimation of the true effect.},

International guidelines suggest lifelong protection by a pre-exposure vaccination scheme followed by timely post-exposure vaccines. Rapidity and magnitude of the antibody recall response after booster inoculation are essential, as many people have been previously immunized a long time ago. The objective of this study was therefore to systematically review the evidence on the boostability of rabies immunization to date. We included 36 studies, of which 19 studies were suitable for meta-analysis. Reduced antibody levels were found after intradermal primary schedules as compared to intramuscular schedules. However, responses after booster immunization were adequate for both routes. Although studies showed that antibody levels decline over time, adequate booster responses were still retained over long time intervals indicating that post-exposure treatment is effective without extra measures after long periods of time.},

	abstract = {This review assesses factors affecting fouling in conventional pens for slaughter pigs. Fouling of the pen happens when pigs change their excretory behaviour from occurring in the designated dunging area to the lying area. This can result in a lower hygiene, bad air quality, extra work for the farmer, disturbance of the pigs' resting behaviour and an increase in agonistic interactions. A systematic search was conducted and results narrowed down to 21 articles. Four factors were found to affect fouling directly: insufficient space allowance, the flooring design of the pen, the thermal climate and pigs' earlier experience. Further, these primary factors are affected by secondary factors such as the shape of the pen, the weight of the pigs and especially the heat balance of the pigs, which is affected by several tertiary factors including, for example, temperature, humidity and draught. Results indicate that the most important factor to control when trying to prevent fouling of a pen is the pen climate. An appropriate climate may be accomplished through floor cooling in the designated lying area, sprinklers above the designated dunging area and by ensuring a more optimal ambient temperature curve that also fits the weight of the pigs in different stages of the production. All in all, fouling of the pen in conventional slaughter pigs is a multifactorial problem, but it is important to focus on increasing the comfortability, and especially the climate, of the designated lying area.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Human cercarial dermatitis (HCD) is a water-borne zoonotic parasitic disease. Cercariae of the avian schistosomes of several genera are frequently recognized as the causative agent of HCD. Various studies have been performed regarding prevalence of bird schistosomes in different regions of the world. So far, no study has gathered and analyzed this data systematically. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis study was to determine the prevalence of avian schistosomes worldwide. METHODS: Data were extracted from six available databases for studies published from 1937 to 2017. Generally, 41 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were used for data extraction in this systematic review. Most of studies have been conducted on the family Anatidae. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of avian schistosomes was estimated to be 34.0\% (95\%CI, 28\%-41\%) around the world. Furthermore, results displayed that, Allobilharzia visceralis and Trichobilharzia spp. had the highest frequency and their prevalence in the birds was 50.0\% (95\% CI, 3.0\%-97.0\%) and 32.0\% (95\% CI, 21.0\%-0.36\%), respectively. The results showed that the prevalence of avian schistosomes was 43.0\% (95\% CI, 29\% - 56\%) in the US and 38.0\% (27.0\% -50.0\%) in Europe, which were higher than other continents, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of 34\% shows that the bird schistosomes are very common zoonotic worms among aquatic birds in the world. Also, this study shows the importance of avian schistosome research when facing animal and human health of the future.},

Of the 56 DAS identified, 41 were based on field testing, eight on experimental challenge studies and seven on both. Also, we adapted human and terrestrial-animal standards and guidelines for DAS structure for use in aquatic animal diagnostic research. Through this process, we identified and addressed important metrics for consideration at the design phase: study purpose, targeted disease state, selection of appropriate samples and specimens, laboratory analytical methods, statistical methods and data interpretation. These recommended design standards for DAS are presented as a checklist including risk-of-failure points and actions to mitigate bias at each critical step.

During DIC, platelets play an important role in the development of micro thrombosis, but changes in platelet function parameters and their association with development of DIC have not been established. The present systematic review investigated reported associations between platelet function (activation, aggregation, and adhesion) and DIC. We performed a literature search in Embase and PubMed, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. In total, 22 articles were included; 14 human studies, seven animal studies, and one with both human and animal subjects. Platelet activation markers were generally reported to be higher in both DIC patients and animals with DIC than healthy controls, and higher among patients with DIC than patients without DIC. Six human and six animal studies investigated platelet aggregation, which were overall reported to be lower in DIC than in non-DIC or in healthy controls in both human and animal studies. Platelet aggregation was deemed to be confounded by low platelet counts, which are known to affect platelet aggregation analyses even within the reference interval. In conclusion, platelet activation analyses showed promise in diagnosis of DIC, but semi-automatization and standardization are warranted before these can be implemented in daily clinical practice. Changes in platelet aggregation analyses during DIC remain inconclusive, and further studies including adjustment for low platelet count are needed to clarify the role of platelet aggregation in DIC.},

This study was conducted to estimate the pooled prevalence of VRE in food of animal origin worldwide, to assess the result heterogeneity, and to determine cumulative evidence and the trend of the prevalence over time. Relevant studies were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled prevalence of VRE in food of animal origin. Subgroup meta-analysis was used to assess the heterogeneity of the results. A cumulative meta-analysis and meta-regression were conducted to determine cumulative evidence and the trend of the prevalence of VRE in food of animal origin over time, respectively. Of the 1352 retrieved studies, 50 articles were included. The pooled prevalence of VRE in food of animal origin was 11.7\% (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] = 8.4 to 16.0). Subgroup meta-analyses showed a significant difference in the prevalence of VRE for two characteristics. First, for the source of food, the prevalence of VRE was highest in aquatic food (43.4\% [95\% CI = 28.4 to 59.7]) and lowest in dairy food (4.1\% [95\% CI = 1.7 to 9.8]). Second, for continents, the prevalence of VRE was highest in Africa (18.5\% [95\% CI = 12.8 to 26.1]) and lowest in North America (0.3\% [95\% CI = 0.1 to 1.1]). Cumulative evidence showed two distinct features in two different periods. The pooled prevalence of VRE rapidly decreased from 79.3\% in 1998 to 13.1\% in 2003; it has slightly fluctuated between 10.5\% and 20.5\% since 2004. The results of the meta-regression indicated that the prevalence gradually decreased over time. In conclusion, the estimate of overall VRE prevalence worldwide in food of animal origin was ∼12\%, indicating the burden of VRE contamination in food of animal origin.},

We find that the core PAW literature is small (n = 10 papers) but links to wider areas of current research interest. The PAW literature is defined by four features: (1) positive emotions which is arguably the most widely acknowledged; (2) positive affective engagement which serves to functionally link positive emotions to goal-directed behavior; (3) quality of life which serves to situate PAW within the context of finding the right balance of positives over negatives; (4) happiness which brings a full life perspective to PAW. While the two first points are already part of welfare research going back decades, the two latter points could be linked to more recent research agendas concerning aggregation and how specific events may affect the ability of animals to make the best of their lives.},

	abstract = {Background Rabies is a fatal yet vaccine-preventable disease. In the last two decades, domestic dog populations have been shown to constitute the predominant reservoir of rabies in developing countries, causing 99\% of human rabies cases. Despite substantial control efforts, dog rabies is still widely endemic and is spreading across previously rabies-free areas. Developing a detailed understanding of dog rabies dynamics and the impact of vaccination is essential to optimize existing control strategies and developing new ones. In this scoping review, we aimed at disentangling the respective contributions of mathematical models and phylodynamic approaches to advancing the understanding of rabies dynamics and control in domestic dog populations. We also addressed the methodological limitations of both approaches and the remaining issues related to studying rabies spread and how this could be applied to rabies control. Methodology/principal findings We reviewed how mathematical modelling of disease dynamics and phylodynamics have been developed and used to characterize dog rabies dynamics and control. Through a detailed search of the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, we identified a total of n = 59 relevant studies using mathematical models (n = 30), phylodynamic inference (n = 22) and interdisciplinary approaches (n = 7). We found that despite often relying on scarce rabies epidemiological data, mathematical models investigated multiple aspects of rabies dynamics and control. These models confirmed the overwhelming efficacy of massive dog vaccination campaigns in all settings and unraveled the role of dog population structure and frequent introductions in dog rabies maintenance. Phylodynamic approaches successfully disentangled the evolutionary and environmental determinants of rabies dispersal and consistently reported support for the role of reintroduction events and human-mediated transportation over long distances in the maintenance of rabies in endemic areas. Potential biases in data collection still need to be properly accounted for in most of these analyses. Finally, interdisciplinary studies were determined to provide the most comprehensive assessments through hypothesis generation and testing. They also represent new avenues, especially concerning the reconstruction of local transmission chains or clusters through data integration. Conclusions/significance Despite advances in rabies knowledge, substantial uncertainty remains regarding the mechanisms of local spread, the role of wildlife in dog rabies maintenance, and the impact of community behavior on the efficacy of control strategies including vaccination of dogs. Future integrative approaches that use phylodynamic analyses and mechanistic models within a single framework could take full advantage of not only viral sequences but also additional epidemiological information as well as dog ecology data to refine our understanding of rabies spread and control. This would represent a significant improvement on past studies and a promising opportunity for canine rabies research in the frame of the One Health concept that aims to achieve better public health outcomes through cross-sector collaboration.},

One study examined the effects of vitamin B$_{\textrm{12}}$ interventions in NTDs in animal and in vitro models. Few prospective studies have been conducted to date to examine the role of vitamin B$_{\textrm{12}}$ in NTDs.

The search process was based on the selection of publications listed in the Pubmed-Medline database until April 2016 to identify studies evaluating the impact of short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides or oligofructose on glucose homeostasis. Twenty-nine trials were included in the systematic review and the meta-analysis was performed on twelve of these papers according to the inclusion criteria. Fasting blood concentrations of glucose and insulin were selected as pertinent criteria of glucose homeostasis for the meta-analysis. The consumption of fructo-oligosaccharides decreased fasting blood glycaemia levels, whatever the metabolic status (healthy, obese or diabetic) and diet (low-fat or high-fat) throughout the experiment. This reduction was linear with prebiotic dose (from 0 to 13\% of the feed). Fasting insulinaemia also decreased linearly with fructo-oligosaccharide supplementation but the reduction was only significant in rodents fed a low-fat diet. Potential underlying mechanisms include gut bacterial fermentation of fructo-oligosaccharides to short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bacterial modulation of bile acids, both interacting with host metabolism. This systemic review, followed by the meta-analysis, provides evidence that fructo-oligosaccharide supplementation has a significant effect on glucose homeostasis whatever the health status and diet consumed by animals.},

This relationship is associated with lesser than typical progesterone (P4) concentrations when feeding diets with greater energy content due to increased hepatic clearance. There is no consensus, however, as to whether feeding should be restricted during early pregnancy to avert this possible detrimental effect. Thus, the aim of this systematic review is to assess the effect in sows and gilts of feeding diets with different energy contents post-mating on embryonic survival, evaluating when possible, the relationship of a greater energy intake and P4 concentrations on embryonic survival. An electronic search was conducted of the PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of science, and Scielo databases during June 2018. A total of 109 articles were retrieved, and of these, only 16 articles were selected after applying the selection criteria. There was no negative effect of a greater feed intake than that needed for body maintenance after breeding in 75\% of the experiments. Results from 35\% of the experiments indicated feeding early pregnant sows a diet with greater energy content than that needed for body maintenance resulted in augmented embryonic death. In 66.7\% of the experiments, in which there was assessment of P4 concentration, there was no negative effect of feeding after farrowing a diet with greater energy than that needed for body maintenance. In conclusion, it appears that restricted feed intake in early pregnancy is no longer relevant when there are modern prolific dam lines utilized in swine production enterprises because dietary energy of as great as 54 MJ ME/day had no detrimental effect on embryo survival.},

	abstract = {Meta-analytic methods were used to determine statistical relationships between metabolizable AA supplies and milk protein yield, milk protein percentage, and milk yield in lactating dairy cows. Sixty-three research publications (258 treatment means) were identified through a search of published literature using 3 search engines and met the criteria for inclusion in this meta-analysis. The Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS) version 6.5 was used to determine dietary nutrient parameters including metabolizable AA. Two approaches were used to analyze the data. First, mixed models were fitted to determine whether explanatory variables predicted responses. Each mixed model contained a global intercept, a random intercept for each experiment, and data were weighted by the inverse of the SEM squared. The second analysis approach used classical effect size meta-analytical evaluation of responses to treatment weighted by the inverse of the treatment variance and with a random effect of treatment nested within experiment. Regardless of the analytical approach, CNCPS-predicted metabolizable Met (g/d) was associated with milk protein percentage and yield. Milk yield was positively associated with CNCPS-predicted metabolizable His, Leu, Trp, Thr, and nonessential AA (g/d). Milk true protein yield was also associated with CNCPS-predicted metabolizable Leu (g/d). Predicted metabolizable Lysine (g/d) did not increase responses in production outcomes. However, mean metabolizable Lys supply was less than typically recommended and the change with treatment was minimal (157 vs. 162 g; 6.36 vs. 6.38\% metabolizable protein). Experiments based solely on Lys or Met interventions were excluded from the study database. It is possible that the inclusion of these experiments may have provided additional insight into the effect of these AA on responses. This meta-analysis supports other research indicating a positive effect of Met and His as co-limiting AA in dairy cows and suggests Leu, Trp, and Thr be given greater consideration in future research.},

	abstract = {Benefits of hormonal growth promotants (HGPs) include production efficiency, profit, and reduced environmental effects for beef cattle. Questions remain about effects of HGP on beef quality, particularly on measures of toughness such as Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF), tenderness, and other taste-panel attributes of beef. The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the effects of HGP on beef quality using the results of randomized controlled trials identified from 3 searched databases. Thirty-one experiments with 181 treatment comparisons were used to evaluate the effects of HGP on WBSF and sensory measures of beef quality. Experiments varied in design, used many different hormonal treatments and combinations, which were single or repeated, in different breeds and sex groups of cattle, with or without electrical stimulation, and with different lengths of time on feed and beef aging. The effects of multiple treatment comparisons in experiments were evaluated using robust regression models and compared to Knapp-Hartung and permutation meta-analytical methods. Increased WBSF was associated with HGP treatment. Use of multiple HGP implants was associated with an increase in WBSF of 0.248 kg (95\% CI = 0.203 to 0.292). Effects of a single implant only increased WBSF by 0.176 kg (95\% CI = 0.109 to 0.242). Aging of beef did not alter the association of HGP with increased WBSF (P = 0.105); however, the point direction was toward a reduced effect with aging (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.005 per day aged). While aging lowered WBSF, it did not reduce the SMD between HGP treatment and reference groups. Comparisons using trenbolone acetate did not differ in WBSF from those using other implants (P {\textgreater} 0.15). The findings on sensory panel tenderness differ from those using WBSF as HGP treatment was not associated with reduced tenderness (P {\textgreater} 0.3) and multiple HGP treatments improved tenderness (SMD = 0.468) compared to a single implant. Further, juiciness, flavor, and connective tissue were not associated with HGP use, whereas there was a marked 5.5-point decrease in the Meat Standards Australia meat quality 4 score, albeit with limited experiments. In general, the true variance of experiments, tau2 (τ2) was low ({\textless}0.1), but heterogeneity, I2 was high ({\textgreater}50\%) indicating that much of the variance was due to factors other than measurement error. More targeted studies on the role of HGP in influencing beef quality are needed.},

A literature search was performed in June 2020 using the keywords rooster AND (semen OR spermatozoa OR sperm OR ejaculate OR ejaculation). This report followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. The PICO (population intervention comparison outcome) question was defined to compare roosters (Population) which had added antioxidants in the semen (Intervention) compared to the no-antioxidant group (Control); the outcome was semen quality (Outcome). Only articles investigating rooster cooled or frozen enriched semen with antioxidant extenders (Gallus Gallus domesticus) were selected by reading the title and abstract, totalizing 38 articles. After full text reading, we found that only 13 studies carried out sperm characteristics and fertility assays. To assess article quality, 15 items related to rooster breeding conditions, seminal collection methodology, and analyzed variables (seminal characteristics and fertility test) were established. There were positive effects of antioxidants on the preservation of seminal characteristics (motility, viability, membrane integrity, antioxidant activity, and lipid peroxidation) and on semen fertility after the conservation process. We conclude that the antioxidants reduce the oxidative stress and improve fertilizing capacity. The most used substances for cooled semen are glutathione, CoQ10, and l-carnitine; whereas for frozen semen, resveratrol, lycopene, and quercitin are most frequently used.},

	abstract = {Air pollution is a global health concern. Particulate matter (PM)(2.5), a component of ambient air pollution, has been identified by the World Health Organization as one of the pollutants that poses the greatest threat to public health. Cardiovascular health effects have been extensively documented, and these effects are still being researched to provide an overview of recent literature regarding air pollution-associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in humans. Additionally, potential mechanisms through which air pollutants affect the cardiovascular system are discussed based on human and additional animal studies. We used the strategy of a narrative review to summarize the scientific literature of studies that were published in the past 7 yr. Searches were carried out on PubMed and Web of Science using predefined search queries. We obtained an initial set of 800 publications that were filtered to 78 publications that were relevant to include in this review. Analysis of the literature showed significant associations between air pollution, especially PM(2.5), and the risk of elevated blood pressure (BP), acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac arrhythmia, and heart failure (HF). Prominent mechanisms that underlie the adverse effects of air pollution include oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, autonomic imbalance, and thrombogenicity. The current review underscores the relevance of air pollution as a global health concern that affects cardiovascular health. More rigorous standards are needed to reduce the cardiovascular disease burden imposed by air pollution. Continued research on the health impact of air pollution is needed to provide further insight.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine radiologic microarchitectural changes in the mandibles of ovariectomized (OVX) rats through a systematic review and meta-analysis and to identify factors of the OVX rat model that influence on the bone microstructure. METHODS: Eligible articles were identified by searching electronic databases, including Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and KoreaMed, for articles published from January 1966 to November 2017. Two reviewers independently performed study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95\% confidence intervals was calculated using a random-effects model. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed to explore the effect of potential sources on the outcomes. The reliability of the results was assessed by sensitivity analysis and publication bias. RESULTS: Of 1160 studies, 16 studies (120 OVX and 120 control rats) were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to the control group, the OVX rats' trabecular bone volume fraction (SMD = - 2.41, P {\textless} 0.01, I(2) = 81\%), trabecular thickness (SMD = - 1.73, P {\textless} 0.01, I(2) = 73\%) and bone mineral density (SMD = - 0.95, P = 0.01, I(2) = 71\%) displayed the bone loss consistent with osteoporosis. The trabecular separation (SMD = 1.66, P {\textless} 0.01, I(2) = 51\%) has widen in the OVX mandibular bone in comparison to the control group. However, the trabecular number showed no indication to detect the osteoporosis (SMD = - 0.45, P = 0.38, I(2) = 76\%). The meta-regression indicated that longer post-OVX periods led to greater changes in bone mineral density (β = - 0.104, P = 0.017). However, the rats' age at OVX was not linked to bone microstructure change. CONCLUSIONS: Using meta-regression and sensitivity analysis techniques, heterogeneity across the micro CT studies of OVX-induced osteoporosis was found. The major factors of heterogeneity were the region of interest and post-OVX period. Our assessment can assist in designing experiments to maximize the usefulness of OVX rat model.},

	abstract = {Multiple studies have suggested that ω-3 fatty acid intake may have a protective effect on cancer risk; however, its true association with cancer risk remains controversial. We performed an umbrella review of meta-analyses to summarize and evaluate the evidence for the association between ω-3 fatty acid intake and cancer outcomes. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception to December 1, 2018. We included meta-analyses of observational studies that examined associations between intake of fish or ω-3 fatty acid and cancer risk (gastrointestinal, liver, breast, gynecologic, prostate, brain, lung, and skin) and determined the level of evidence of associations. In addition, we appraised the quality of the evidence of significant meta-analyses by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. We initially screened 598 articles, and 15 articles, including 57 meta-analyses, were eligible. Among 57 meta-analyses, 15 reported statistically significant results. We found that 12 meta-analyses showed weak evidence of an association between ω-3 fatty acid intake and risk of the following types of cancer: liver cancer (n = 4 of 6), breast cancer (n = 3 of 14), prostate cancer (n = 3 of 11), and brain tumor (n = 2 of 2). In the other 3 meta-analyses, studies of endometrial cancer and skin cancer, there were no assessable data for determining the evidence levels. No meta-analysis showed convincing, highly suggestive, or suggestive evidence of an association. In the sensitivity analysis of meta-analyses by study design, we found weak associations between ω-3 fatty acid intake and breast cancer risk in cohort studies, but no statistically significant association in case-control studies. However, the opposite results were found in case of brain tumor risk. Although ω-3 fatty acids have been studied in several meta-analyses with regard to a wide range of cancer outcomes, only weak associations were identified in some cancer types, with several limitations. Considering the nonsignificant or weak evidence level, clinicians and researchers should cautiously interpret reported associations between ω-3 fatty acid consumption and cancer risks.},

Studies of dairy foods and the risk of the MetS and its components published up to June 2016 were searched using PubMed, EMBASE and a reference search. Random-effects models were used to estimate the pooled relative risks (RR) with 95 \% CI. Finally, ten cross-sectional studies, two nested case-control studies and twenty-nine cohort studies were included for the analysis. In a dose-response analysis of cohort studies and cross-sectional studies, the pooled RR of the MetS for a one-serving/d increment of total dairy food (nine studies) and milk (six studies) consumption (200 g/d) were 0·91 (95 \% CI 0·85, 0·96) and 0·87 (95 \% CI 0·79, 0·95), respectively. The pooled RR of the MetS for yogurt (three studies) consumption (100 g/d) was 0·82 (95 \% CI 0·73, 0·91). Total dairy food consumption was associated with lower risk of MetS components, such as hyperglycaemia, elevated blood pressure, hypertriacylglycerolaemia and low HDL- cholesterol. A one-serving/d increment of milk was related to a 12 \% lower risk of abdominal obesity, and a one-serving/d increment of yogurt was associated with a 16 \% lower risk of hyperglycaemia. These associations were not significantly different by study design, study location or adjustment factors. This meta-analysis showed that specific types of dairy food consumption such as milk and yogurt as well as total dairy food consumption were inversely related to risk of the MetS and its components.},

	abstract = {High ambient temperature (AT) is a major constraint on efficiency of farming in pig production. Results of reported studies assessing the influences of high AT on pig performance are highly variable, particularly in pigs with different body weight (BW). Therefore, a meta-analysis from ISI Web of Science and PubMed was operated to explain variations of average daily feed intake (ADFI) and average daily gain (ADG) in the reports across literatures during high AT in growing or finishing pigs. Pigs were divided to three BW categories as LOW (46 to 65 kg), MED (65{\textless} to 85 kg), and HGH (85{\textless} kg). The significant effect of AT on ADG were observed in LOW, MED, and HGH categories. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) for multiple linear regression shows significance of linear relationships between both ADG and ADFI, and AT and BW as: ADG$_{\textrm{LOW}}$=1260-19.9*AT+2.09*BW, ADG$_{\textrm{MED}}$=1546-22.5*AT-0.88*W, ADG$_{\textrm{HGH}}$=1893-31.9*AT-2.40*BW, ADFI$_{\textrm{LOW}}$=1756-35.0*AT+24.6*BW, ADFI$_{\textrm{MED}}$=2793-49.6*AT+12.5*BW, and ADFI$_{\textrm{HGH}}$=4172-59.0*AT+0.74*BW. The significant effect of temperature on gain to feed ratio (G:F) was observed in LOW and HGH categories. The ANOVA for multiple regression revealed evidence on high significance of linear relationships between G:F and AT: G:F$_{\textrm{LOW}}$=0.80+0.02*AT+0.02*BW, G:F$_{\textrm{MED}}$=0.95+0.02*AT+0.02*BW, and G:F$_{\textrm{HGH}}$=0.78+0.05*AT+0.01*BW. The overall results of mixed model analysis show that the significant interaction between BW and AT means that pigs in heavier category have lower G:F when temperature increases. In conclusion, high AT linearly decrease the ADG, ADFI, and G:F of growing and finishing pigs.},

Peptide biomarker studies have failed to consistently predict bone injury. Molecular profiling studies provide an opportunity to study equine musculoskeletal disease. A systematic review of the literature was performed using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines to assess the use of miRNA profiling studies in equine and human musculoskeletal injuries. Data were extracted from 40 papers between 2008 and 2020. Three miRNA studies profiling equine musculoskeletal disease were identified, none of which related to equine stress fractures. Eleven papers studied miRNA profiles in osteoporotic human patients with fractures, but differentially expressed miRNAs were not consistent between studies. MicroRNA target prediction programmes also produced conflicting results between studies. Exercise affected miRNA profiles in both horse and human studies (e.g., miR-21 was upregulated by endurance exercise and miR-125b was downregulated by exercise). MicroRNA profiling studies in horses continue to emerge, but as yet, no miRNA profile can reliably predict the occurrence of fractures. It is very important that future studies are well designed to mitigate the effects of variation in sample size, exercise and normalisation methods.},

	abstract = {Maternal undernutrition during pregnancy is prevalent across the globe, and the origins of many chronic diseases can be traced back to in utero conditions. This systematic review considers the current evidence in animal models regarding the relationship between maternal global nutrient restriction during pregnancy and offspring kidney structure and function. CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Scopus were searched to November 2017. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines were followed, and articles were screened by two independent reviewers. Twenty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria: 16 studies were on rats, 9 on sheep, 2 on baboons, and 1 on goats. The majority of the rat studies had maternal global nutrient restriction during pregnancy at 50\% of ad libitum while restriction for sheep and baboon studies ranged from 50\% to 75\%. Because of the heterogeneity of outcome measures and the large variation in the age of offspring at followup, no meta-analysis was possible. Common outcome measures included kidney weight, nephron number, glomerular size, glomerular filtration rate, and creatinine clearance. To date, there have been no studies assessing kidney function in large animal models. Most studies were rated as having a high or unknown risk of bias. The current body of evidence in animals suggests that exposure to maternal global nutrient restriction during pregnancy has detrimental effects on offspring kidney structure and function, such as lower kidney weight, lower nephron endowment, larger glomerular size, and lower glomerular filtration rate. Further long-term followup of studies in large animal models investigating kidney function through to adulthood are warranted.},

This paper describes a systematic review of methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis, comparing trial design between 147 animal and 512 human studies. Animal studies generally included fewer subjects than human studies, and less frequently reported randomisation and blinding. In relation to life span, study duration was comparable for animals and humans, but included animals were younger than included humans. Animal studies often comprised males only (61\%), human studies always included females (98\% included both sexes). Power calculations were poorly reported in both samples. Analyses of human studies more frequently comprised Chi-square tests, those of animal studies more frequently reported analyses of variance. Administration route was more variable, and more frequently reported in animal than human studies. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and c-reactive protein were analysed more frequently in human than in animal studies. To conclude, experimental designs for animal and human studies are not optimally aligned. However, methotrexate is effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis in animal models and humans. Further evaluation of the available evidence in other research fields is needed to increase the understanding of translational success before we can optimise translational strategies.},

After duplicate removal, 12,304 publications were left. Because of the large number of models, in the current paper, only the genetic models are presented. A total of 636 publications were identified describing genetic animal models for CF in mice, pigs, ferrets, rats and zebrafish. Most of these models have an altered Cftr gene. An overview of basic model characteristics and outcome measures for these genetic models is provided, together with advice on using these data. As far as the authors are aware, this is one of the largest systematic mapping reviews on genetic animal models for CF. It can aid in selecting a suitable model and outcome measures.

	doi = {10.1186/s12967-019-1976-2},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Drug development is currently hampered by high attrition rates; many developed treatments fail during clinical testing. Part of the attrition may be due to low animal-to-human translational success rates; so-called "translational failure". As far as we know, no systematic overview of published translational success rates exists. SYSTEMATIC SCOPING REVIEW: The following research question was examined: "What is the observed range of the animal-to-human translational success (and failure) rates within the currently available empirical evidence?". We searched PubMed and Embase on 16 October 2017. We included reviews and all other types of "umbrella"-studies of meta-data quantitatively comparing the translational results of studies including at least two species with one being human. We supplemented our database searches with additional strategies. All abstracts and full-text papers were screened by two independent reviewers. Our scoping review comprises 121 references, with various units of measurement: compound or intervention (k = 104), study/experiment (k = 10), and symptom or event (k = 7). Diagnostic statistics corresponded with binary and continuous definitions of successful translation. Binary definitions comprise percentages below twofold error, percentages accurately predicted, and predictive values. Quantitative definitions comprise correlation/regression (r(2)) and meta-analyses (percentage overlap of 95\% confidence intervals). Translational success rates ranged from 0 to 100\%. CONCLUSION: The wide range of translational success rates observed in our study might indicate that translational success is unpredictable; i.e. it might be unclear upfront if the results of primary animal studies will contribute to translational knowledge. However, the risk of bias of the included studies was high, and much of the included evidence is old, while newer models have become available. Therefore, the reliability of the cumulative evidence from current papers on this topic is insufficient. Further in-depth "umbrella"-studies of translational success rates are still warranted. These are needed to evaluate the probabilistic evidence for predictivity of animal studies for the human situation more reliably, and to determine which factors affect this process.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pollination services provided by solitary bees, the largest group of bees worldwide, are critical to the vitality of ecosystems and agricultural systems alike. Disconcertingly, bee populations are in decline, and while no single causative factor has been identified, pesticides are believed to play a role in downward population trends. The effects of pesticides on solitary bee species have not been previously systematically cataloged and reviewed. OBJECTIVES: This systematic scoping review examines available evidence for effects of pesticide exposure on solitary bees to identify data gaps and priority research needs. METHODS: A systematic literature search strategy was developed to identify and document reports on solitary bee pesticide exposure-effects investigations. Literature was subsequently screened for relevance using a Population, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) statement and organized into a systematic evidence map. Investigations were organized by effect category (lethal effects on immatures, lethal effects on adults, sublethal effects on immatures, and sublethal effects on adults), species, pesticide class, and publication year. RESULTS: A comprehensive literature search of Web of Science and ProQuest Agricultural \& Environmental Science supplemented by targeted internet searching and reference mining yielded 176 reports and publications for title and abstract screening and 65 that met PECO criteria (22 included lethal and 43 included sublethal effects endpoints). Relevant design details (pesticide, test compound configuration, study type, species, sex, exposure duration) were extracted into literature inventory tables to reveal the extent endpoints have been investigated and areas in need of additional research. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence mapping revealed diversity in the pesticides and endpoints studied across the database. However, dilution across bee species, lack of complementary laboratory work and paucity of replicated investigations complicate efforts to interpret and apply available data to support pesticide risk assessment.},

METHODS: We selected and analyzed observational studies that discussed the relationships between fresh and processed fish intake on glioma risk from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the SinoMed and Wanfang databases from inception to 31 March 2020. Studies were selected according to pre-established eligibility criteria and data were extracted separately by two researchers. A meta-analysis was conducted based on a random-effects model to provide pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Eight studies considered the relationship between fish intake (seven fresh and seven processed fish) and glioma risk and were included in this meta-analysis. The OR effect size for fresh fish intake and glioma risk was 0.72 (95\%CI 0.53-0.97) and the overall OR effect size for processed fish intake and glioma risk was 1.88 (95\%CI 1.06-3.34). CONCLUSION: Dietary intake of fresh fish may reduce the risk of glioma, but consumption of processed fish may increase the risk of glioma. This study had some limitations, and further studies are therefore required to clarify the associations between fish intake and glioma risk.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.09.016},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Overuse of antimicrobials in both humans and animals is recognized as one of the main drivers of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR); and the optimisation of their use has been advocated as a key strategy for dealing with AMR. The measurement of antimicrobial use is vital for the design, monitoring and evaluation of such strategies. This systematic review describes and compares methods and measurements used to quantify antimicrobial use in pigs in order to inform efforts to standardize measurement. METHODS: The peer-reviewed literature was systematically searched using four online databases: MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Scopus and Web of Science. Eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review included: articles published in English, involving pigs of any age and types of production, providing quantitative data on antimicrobial use, containing a clear description of the methodology, and having moderate to high rank in the quality assessment. RESULTS: Of 2,362 abstracts reviewed, a total of 25 studies were included based on the eligibility criteria. All studies were published between 2001 and 2017. Twenty of the studies were conducted in eight European countries. Twelve studies estimated antimicrobial use and eight studies were primarily methodological papers comparing different methods or variables, or developing new methods. The two main sources of antimicrobial use data were farm surveys and national sales data. A large variety of units of measurement was found. In this review, the ten measurements identified were categorized into four groups: 1) antimicrobials use measured by milligrams of active substance per animal weight; 2) antimicrobials use measured by daily dose per weight at treatment; 3) antimicrobial use measured by daily dose per treatment period; and 4) antimicrobials use measured by daily dose per period at risk of treatment. CONCLUSION: There is no global standardized measurement of antimicrobial use in pigs. Given the importance of monitoring the use antimicrobials, we recommend that at a minimum, all countries should develop macro-level monitoring using national sales data and report use by milligram of active ingredients per Population Correcting Unit. Monitoring in specific animal species requires the development of systems to capture prescription at national or farm level. Findings from monitoring antimicrobial use may help to guide effective interventions for optimising use of antimicrobials, as recommended by the WHO Global Action Plan on AMR.},

Thirty-six articles were identified and reviewed, of which more than 85\% of studies were conducted in Europe and North America. Penicillins and Tetracyclines groups were the most commonly used antibiotics in many countries. Oral medication in suckling and post-weaning periods were the most common applications of antibiotic administration in pig production. Antibiotic use is driven by age-specific diseases and the common pathogens causing these conditions where epidemiological profiles varied greatly across countries. In addition, the type and size of farm were associated with antibiotic use with finisher and larger farms using more antibiotics than farrow-to-finish and smaller farms. There is variation in the use of the highest priority critically important antimicrobials in humans across studies. However, this review indicates that they are still commonly used in pig production, for treatment and prevention of infection. This evidence calls for global efforts on the prudent use of antibiotics in response to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the agricultural sector.},

	abstract = {Laser therapy could amplify the oral wound healing process by stimulating cell regeneration after injury, attenuating pain, and modulating the immune system. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate whether the application of laser therapy improved alveolar healing after tooth extractions. Eight electronic databases were screened: MedLine (PubMed), The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, Lilacs, Ibecs, Scielo, and BBO. Three reviewers independently assessed the title and abstracts of potentially relevant studies. Only clinical trials and animal experiments that evaluated the wound healing effect of laser therapy after tooth extraction were included. A total of 16 studies fulfilled all criteria, thus 8 animal experiments and 8 clinical trials were included. Different types of laser were evaluated, such as CO(2) , GaAlAs, Nd:YAG, Diode Laser, HeNe, and High-frequency Pulsed Diode Laser. Although HF, Diode and GaAs lasers were able to enhance wound healing process in clinical studies, four trials and one animal experiment showed no improvement in wound healing with laser therapy after tooth extractions. In general, the current available evidence in the literature showed that laser therapy improved the wound healing process, but these findings were limited to the type of laser applied and its specific settings. Further well-designed and randomized controlled trials are needed to support a benefit effect of using laser therapy after tooth extraction. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42014007509 (2014).},

This calls for the exploration of new therapeutic options like cell therapy, which is already effective for various human (lung) disorders. We systematically searched the MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases from the earliest date till January 2017 and included original studies on the perinatal use of cell-based therapies (i.e. cells and/or cell-derivatives) to treat BDP in animal models. Fourth publications describing 47 interventions were retrieved. Newborn mice/rats raised in a hyperoxic environment were studied in most interventions. Different cell types - either intact cells or their conditioned medium - were administered, but bone marrow and umbilical cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cells were most prevalent. All studies reported positive effects on outcome parameters including alveolar and vascular morphometry, lung function, and inflammation. Cell homing to the lungs was demonstrated in some studies, but the therapeutic effects seemed to be mostly mediated via paracrine modulation of inflammation, fibrosis and angiogenesis. CONCLUSION: Multiple rat/mouse studies show promise for cell therapy for BPD. Yet careful study of action mechanisms and side effects in large animal models is imperative before clinical translation can be achieved.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: It is unclear if direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are effective and safe alternatives to low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWHs) for the treatment of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE). We aim to synthesize existing literature that compared DOACs versus LMWHs in this high-risk population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL for all observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (PROSPERO: CRD42017080898). Two authors independently reviewed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed bias. Primary outcomes included 6-month recurrent VTE and major bleeding. Secondary outcomes included clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) and mortality. RESULTS: We screened 426 articles, reviewed 25 in full-text, and selected 13 and 2 for qualitative and quantitative synthesis, respectively. Based on a meta-analysis of the 2 RCTs, DOACs had lower 6-month recurrent VTE (42/725) when compared to LMWH (64/727) (RR: 0.65 (0.42-1.01)). However, DOACs had higher major bleeding (40/725) when compared to LMWH (23/727) (RR 1.74 (1.05-2.88)). Similarly, CRNMB was higher (RR 2.31 (0.85-6.28)) for patients receiving DOACs. There was no difference in mortality (RR 1.03 (0.85-1.26)). Observational studies were heterogeneous with high risks of bias but showed recurrent VTE rates consistent with the meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: DOACs were more effective than LMWHs to prevent recurrent VTE but were associated with a significantly increased risk of major bleeding as well as a trend toward more CRNMB. The absolute risk differences were small (2-3\%) for both primary outcomes and may reflect better compliance with DOACs than LMWHs.},

Two independent reviewers screened the papers,extracted the data,assessed the risk of bias using SYRCLE assessment tool and conducted Meta-analysis with Rev Man 5. 3 software. A total of 10 papers involving 31 studies were finally included,15 studies of which were used for Meta-analysis. Four studies were included for chronic hepatotoxicity animal model. In experimental group( 34 animals),Tripterygium was administered at dose of 0. 09-0. 1 mg·kg-1·d-1,and glycyrrhizic acid was administered at dose of 90-100 mg·kg-1,both for 2 weeks; in control group( 34 animals),glycyrrhizic acid was replaced with equal volume of normal saline. Eleven studies were included for acute hepatotoxicity animal model. In experimental group( 66 animals),glycyrrhizic acid was administered at dose of 75-480 mg·kg-1 for 7 days,then glycyrrhizic acid was stopped,and Tripterygium began to be administered at dose of 0. 6-1. 0 mg·kg-1 per 24 h or 48 h for a total of 1-2 times; in control group( 66 animals),glycyrrhizic acid was replaced with equal volume of normal saline or corresponding solvent. The results of Meta-analysis showed that in both chronic hepatotoxicity animal model and acute hepatotoxicity animal model,the transaminase levels in the experimental group were lower than those in the control group( P {\textless} 0. 05). Subgroup analysis of acute hepatotoxicity animal model showed that the transaminase levels in the experimental group were lower than those in the control group for every subgroup except " glycyrrhizic acid 75 mg·kg-1" subgroup. However,in terms of the mean difference( MD) and confidence interval( CI),there was no significant difference in transaminase decline between each subgroup. Low dose of glycyrrhizic acid( 90-100 mg·kg-1) has a toxicity-reduction effect on chronic hepatotoxicity induced by tripterygium( 0. 09-0. 10 mg·kg-1). Middle and high doses of glycyrrhizic acid( 120-480 mg·kg-1) have a toxicity-reduction effect on acute hepatotoxicity induced by tripterygium( 0. 6-1. 0 mg·kg-1),but with no significant dose-effect relationship.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Trichinella or derived antigens have been suggested to be potential therapeutic agents for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature to estimate the effect of Trichinella or derived antigens on chemically induced IBD. METHODS: Studies were identified by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct from inception to February 2020. We included articles written in English that investigated the effect of Trichinella infection and/or derived products in mouse models of IBD. Studies were pooled, and the combined standard mean difference (SMD) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect or fixed-effect model. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were eventually included in the meta-analysis. The results indicated significant differences in the disease activity index (DAI), myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, macroscopic inflammation score, and microscopic inflammation score between the experimental group and the control group. The anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), IL-10 and IL-13 were significantly increased in the experimental group compared with the control group, whereas the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-17 were significantly decreased. The percentage of regulatory T (Treg) cells was also significantly increased, while the level of the M1 phenotypic macrophage marker iNOS was significantly decreased and the expression of the M2 phenotypic macrophage marker Arg-1 was significantly increased.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been reported mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are recruited to and become integral parts of the tumor microenvironment. MSCs might have an active role in solid tumor progression, especially cancer metastasis. However, the contribution of MSCs in the process of cancer metastasis is still controversial. In this review, we performed a meta-analysis on the effects of MSCs administration on cancer metastasis based on published preclinical studies. METHODS: The PRISMA guidelines were used. A total of 42 publications met the inclusion criteria. Outcome data on the incidence and the number of cancer metastasis as well as study characteristics were extracted. Quality of the studies was assessed according to SYRCLE Risk of Bias tool. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool estimates. RESULTS: Of the 42 studies included, 32 reported that MSCs administration promoted outcome events (numbers or incidences of cancer metastasis), and 39 reported data suitable for meta-analysis. The median effect size (RR) was 2.04 for the incidence of cancer metastasis (95\% CI 1.57-2.65, I(2) = 21\%), and the median effect size (SMD) was 1.23 for the number of cancer metastasis (95\% CI 0.43-2.03, I(2) = 89\%). Heterogeneity was observed, with the greater impact based on study length and different ways of metastasis measurement and MSCs administration. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested MSCs administration increased the number and the incidence of cancer metastasis in experimental cancer models. High heterogeneity and poor reported risk of bias limit the quality of these findings. Further preclinical studies with better design and adequate reporting are still needed.},

Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine were 11.3\% and 4.5\% before and after 2011, 5.3\% and 7.1\% in the eastern and midwestern regions, 13.2\%, 25.5\% and 3.7\% in the tertiary hospitals, secondary hospitals and primary medical institutions, respectively. And 13.3\% were in the areas where the Changchun immortal vaccine was used. The combined rate of adverse reaction to rabies vaccine inoculated in Changsheng vaccine area was 5.1\%. CONCLUSION: After 2011, the rate of adverse reaction to rabies vaccine in China has decreased dramatically. The rate of adverse reaction to rabies vaccine in the midwestern regions is higher than the counterpart in the eastern regions. The primary medical institutions are lower than the counterpart in the tertiary and secondary hospitals.},

Horses are an intermediate host of T. gondii, representing a potential risk for humans. To determine the T. gondii seroprevalence in horses worldwide, a global meta-analysis was conducted. A total of 35 publications were obtained by searching the PubMed, ScienceDirect, Chinese Web of knowledge (CNKI) and Wanfang databases. A total of 12,354 horses were assessed, of which 1580 were positive for T. gondii. The pooled overall seroprevalence of horses infected by T. gondii was 11.29\%. No significant difference of T. gondii seroprevalence was observed between male and female horses. The seroprevalence of T. gondii in horses from different countries varied. Our findings suggest that toxoplasmosis is prevalent in horses worldwide. Therefore, it is necessary to implement continuous monitoring of the status of T. gondii seroprevalence in horses. Moreover, powerful regulatory measures should be implemented to prevent and control the spread of toxoplasmosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Supplementation of feed with long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) during the grower and finisher phases has long been discussed as a growth promotion strategy in pigs, but its effects are inconsistent. The purpose of our study was to comprehensively evaluate its effects on the growth performance based on the average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI) and gain: feed (G:F) ratio and to unveil the roles of the basal diet, LCFA concentration and LCFA saturation. RESULTS: We searched the PubMed and Web of Science databases (articles published from Jan 1(st), 2000, to Sep 30(th), 2018; restricted to English) and compared LCFA-supplemented diets with control diets. We retrieved 2346 studies, 18 of which (1314 pigs, 26 records) were eligible for our analysis. We used a random-effects model to calculate the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). LCFA supplementation in the grower-finisher phase improved the ADG (WMD = 41.74 g/d, 95\% CI: 8.81 to 74.66, P = 0.013) and G:F ratio (WMD = 0.019, 95\% CI: 0.006 to 0.032, P = 0.003). For supplementation solely in the finisher phase, we found a similar performance in the ADG (WMD = 39.93 g/d, 95\% CI: 26.48 to 53.38, P {\textless} 0.001) and G:F ratio (WMD = 0.019, 95\% CI: 0.006 to 0.032, P {\textless} 0.001) but a reduction in the ADFI (WMD = - 83.863 g/d, 95\% CI: - 156.157 to - 11.569, P = 0.023). Specifically, approximately 5\% LCFA supplementation in the finisher phase had significant effects on the ADG (WMD = 51.385 g/d, 95\% CI: 35.816 to 66.954, P {\textless} 0.001), ADFI (WMD = - 102.869 g/d, 95\% CI: - 189.236 to - 16.502, P = 0.02) and G:F ratio (WMD = 0.028, 95\% CI: 0.018 to 0.039, P {\textless} 0.001), whereas a concentration of approximately 1\% exhibited no effects. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, regardless of the basal diet and saturation, LCFA supplementation greatly improves the growth performance of grower and finisher pigs, primarily by increasing the energy density.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Liver cirrhosis (LC) was associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis; however, the association between LC and fracture risk was inconclusive. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the association between LC and fracture risk. DESIGN: To identify related literature, a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of science and the Cochrane Library from 1965 to July 2017 without language limitation was performed. The random-effects model described by DerSimonian and Laird was used to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Eventually, 5 cohort and 3 case-control studies were identified, which included 321 035 subjects and 31 272 fracture cases. The pooled OR of the association between LC and any fracture risk, hip fracture, spine/trunk fracture and limb fracture was 1.94 (95\% CI, 1.59-2.37), 2.11 (95\% CI, 1.34-3.32), 2.00 (95\% CI, 1.50-2.67) and 1.82 (95\% CI, 1.65-2.01), respectively. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study indicates that cirrhotic patients have an increased risk of fracture. Preventive measures should be instituted as early as possible.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Emerging studies reported that combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and nuclear matrix protein 22 (NMP22) could increase the sensitivity and specificity of bladder carcinoma (BC) management. Nevertheless, the reports remain inconsistent. This meta-analysis was undertaken to evaluate the diagnostic performance of FISH, NMP22, and their combination model in BC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang database dated up to October 2018. Suitable studies were identified and raw data were extracted. Meta-analysis was conducted to calculate the global sensitivities, specificities, likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and the areas under the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves for FISH, NMP22, and their combination model, separately. All the meta-analysis estimates were derived using STATA (version 12.0) and MetaDisc (version 1.4) software packages. RESULTS: Seven eligible studies were included for analysis. The global sensitivities with 95\% CI for FISH, NMP22, and their combination model were 0.79 (95\% CI: 0.75-0.83), 0.76 (95\% CI: 0.71-0.81), and 0.82 (95\% CI: 0.75-0.88); specificities were 0.85 (95\% CI: 0.76-0.91), 0.70 (95\% CI: 0.55-0.81), and 0.90 (95\% CI: 0.70-0.97); DORs were 22.215 (95\% CI: 10.695-46.144), 7.365 (95\% CI: 3.986-13.610), and 41.940 (95\% CI: 13.546-129.853); and the areas under the SROC curves were 0.86 (95\% CI: 0.82-0.88), 0.79 (95\% CI: 0.76-0.83), and 0.90 (95\% CI: 0.87-0.92).

However, the risk of hepatic damage caused by statin therapy is still controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis summarizing the existing evidence of the effect of statin therapy on incidence of liver injury to clarify whether statin therapy could lead to liver function test abnormalities. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase database for the relevant studies update till Jan. 2017 regarding statin therapy and liver injury. Two researchers screened the literature independently by the selection and exclusion criteria. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random effects models, and subgroup analyses were performed by study characteristics. This meta-analysis was performed by STATA 13.1 software. RESULTS: Analyses were based on 74,078 individuals from 16 studies. The summary OR of statin therapy was 1.18 (95\% CI: 1.01-1.39, p = 0.04; I(2) = 0.0\%) for liver injury. Subgroup analysis indicated that fluvastatin increased the risk of liver injury significantly (OR, 3.50; 95\% CI: 1.07-11.53, p = 0.039; I(2) = 0.0\%) and dose over 40 mg/daily had an unfavorable effect on the liver damage (OR, 3.62; 95\% CI: 1.52-8.65, p = 0.004; I(2) = 0.0\%). The sensitivity analysis indicated that the results were robust.

Existing studies remain largely preclinical and exhibit marked design heterogeneity. A systematic review of controlled preclinical trials of human ECFCs is needed to guide future study design and to accelerate clinical translation. A systematic search of Medline and EMBASE on 1 April 2019 returned 3131 unique entries of which 66 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most studies used ECFCs derived from umbilical cord or adult peripheral blood. Studies used genetically modified immunodeficient mice (n = 52) and/or rats (n = 16). ECFC phenotypes were inconsistently characterized. While {\textgreater}90\% of studies used CD31+ and CD45-, CD14- was demonstrated in 73\% of studies, CD146+ in 42\%, and CD10+ in 35\%. Most disease models invoked ischemia. Peripheral vascular ischemia (n = 29), central nervous system ischemia (n = 14), connective tissue injury (n = 10), and cardiovascular ischemia and reperfusion injury (n = 7) were studied most commonly. Studies showed predominantly positive results; only 13 studies reported ≥1 outcome with null results, three reported only null results, and one reported harm. Quality assessment with SYRCLE revealed potential sources of bias in most studies. Preclinical ECFC studies are associated with benefit across several ischemic conditions in animal models, although combining results is limited by marked heterogeneity in study design. In particular, characterization of ECFCs varied and aspects of reporting introduced risk of bias in most studies. More studies with greater focus on standardized cell characterization and consistency of the disease model are needed.},

	abstract = {Background: As not all ischemic stroke patients benefit from currently available treatments, there is considerable need for neuroprotective co-therapies. Therapeutic hypothermia is one such co-therapy, but numerous issues have hampered its clinical use (e.g., pneumonia risk with whole-body cooling). Some problems may be avoided with brain-specific methods, such as intra-arterial selective cooling infusion (IA-SCI) into the arteries supplying the ischemic tissue. Objective: Our research question was about the efficacy of IA-SCI in animal middle cerebral artery occlusion models. We hypothesized that IA-SCI would be beneficial, but translationally-relevant study elements may be missing (e.g., aged animals). Methods: We completed a systematic review of the PubMed database following the PRISMA guidelines on May 21, 2020 for animal studies that administered IA-SCI in the peri-reperfusion period and assessed infarct volume, behavior (primary meta-analytic endpoints), edema, or blood-brain barrier injury (secondary endpoints). Our search terms included: "focal ischemia" and related terms, "IA-SCI" and related terms, and "animal" and related terms. Nineteen studies met inclusion criteria. We adapted a methodological quality scale from 0 to 12 for experimental design assessment (e.g., use of blinding/randomization, a priori sample size calculations). Results: Studies were relatively homogenous (e.g., all studies used young, healthy animals). Some experimental design elements, such as blinding, were common whereas others, such as sample size calculations, were infrequent (median methodological quality score: 5; range: 2-7). Our analyses revealed that IA-SCI provides benefit on all endpoints (mean normalized infarct volume reduction = 23.67\%; 95\% CI: 19.21-28.12; mean normalized behavioral improvement = 35.56\%; 95\% CI: 25.91-45.20; mean standardized edema reduction = 0.95; 95\% CI: 0.56-1.34). Unfortunately, blood-brain barrier assessments were uncommon and could not be analyzed. However, there was substantial statistical heterogeneity and relatively few studies. Therefore, exploration of heterogeneity via meta-regression using saline infusion parameters, study quality, and ischemic duration was inconclusive. Conclusion: Despite convincing evidence of benefit in ischemic stroke models, additional studies are required to determine the scope of benefit, especially when considering additional elements (e.g., dosing characteristics). As there is interest in using this treatment alongside current ischemic stroke therapies, more relevant animal studies will be critical to inform patient studies.},

Total protein intakes were generally above the recommended dietary allowance at the baseline and end of intervention. Results from the meta-analyses demonstrated that protein source did not affect changes in absolute lean mass or muscle strength.

	abstract = {Background: Physiological responses related to manual therapy (MT) treatment have been investigated over decades using various animal models. However, these studies have not been compiled and their collective findings appraised. The purpose of this scoping review was to assess current scientific knowledge on the physiological responses related to MT and/or simulated MT procedures in animal models so as to act as a resource to better inform future mechanistic and clinical research incorporating these therapeutic interventions. Methods: PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane, Embase, and Index of Chiropractic Literature (ICL) were searched from database inception to August 2019. Eligible studies were: (a) published in English; (b) non-cadaveric animal-based; (c) original data studies; (d) included a form of MT or simulated MT as treatment; (e) included quantification of at least one delivery parameter of MT treatment; (f) quantification of at least one physiological measure that could potentially contribute to therapeutic mechanisms of action of the MT. MT studies were categorized according to three main intervention types: (1) mobilization; (2) manipulation; and (3) massage. Two-phase screening procedures were conducted by a pair of independent reviewers, data were extracted from eligible studies and qualitatively reported. Results: The literature search resulted in 231 articles of which 78 met inclusion criteria and were sorted by intervention type. Joint mobilization induced changes in nociceptive response and inflammatory profile, gene expression, receptor activation, neurotransmitter release and enzymatic activity. Spinal manipulation produced changes in muscle spindle response, nocifensive reflex response and neuronal activity, electromyography, and immunologic response. Physiological changes associated with massage therapy included autonomic, circulatory, lymphatic and immunologic functions, visceral response, gene expression, neuroanatomy, function and pathology, and cellular response to in vitro simulated massage. Conclusion: Pre-clinical research supports an association between MT physiological response and multiple potential short-term MT therapeutic mechanisms. Optimization of MT delivery and/or treatment efficacy will require additional preclinical investigation in which MT delivery parameters are controlled and reported using pathological and/or chronic pain models that mimic neuromusculoskeletal conditions for which MT has demonstrated clinical benefit.},

The systematic review was performed on September 1, 2019, using PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science; studies published after January 1, 2010, were selected. The data were summarized in tables, critically analyzed, and treated statistically using the RStudio® Software with Meta package and Metaprop Command. After applying exclusion factors, 41 relevant studies were selected from 969 articles identified on literature search. The overall rate of polymyxin-resistant A. baumannii (PRAB) related to hospitalized patients was estimated to be 13\% (95\% CI, 0.06-0.27), where a higher rate was observed in America (29\%; 95\% CI, 0.12-0.55), followed by Europe (13\%; 95\% CI, 0.02-0.52), and Asia (10\%; 95\% CI, 0.02-0.32). The extensive use of polymyxins on veterinary to control bacterial infection and growth promotion, as well as the resurgence in prescription and use of polymyxins in the clinics against carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria, may have contributed to the increased incidence of PRAB. The findings of this meta-analysis revealed that the rate of PRAB recovered from hospitalized patients is distinctively high. Thus, action needs to be taken to develop strategies to combat the clinical incidence of PRAB-induced hospital infections.},

	abstract = {Leishmaniases are a group of diseases of zoonotic importance caused by over 20 species of protozoa of the genus Leishmania, in which domestic dogs are considered to be the main reservoir for the disease. However, the involvement of other vertebrates as reservoirs for these parasites has also been investigated. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to carry out a systematic review with meta-analysis on occurrences of leishmaniasis in equids. The case reports described animals with cutaneous symptoms of leishmaniasis (papules, nodules, ulcers or crusts) that regressed spontaneously, located mainly on the head and limbs, from which three species of protozoa were identified in the lesions: Leishmania braziliensis, Leishmania infantum and Leishmania siamensis. In turn, the meta-analysis showed a combined prevalence of 25\%, although with high heterogeneity among the studies, which was attributed to the use of different methods for diagnosing the disease. Leishmaniasis in equids is a benign disease but it should be included in the differential diagnosis of cutaneous diseases among these species. Seroepidemiological studies are important in investigating and monitoring suspected exposure of these hosts to the parasite, especially in endemic areas. However, there is also a need to standardize diagnostic methods.},

The objectives of this study were: (1) To identify novel pharmacological therapies investigated in experimental animal studies and (2) to identify pharmacological therapies translated from experimental animal studies to clinical trials. METHODS: PubMed was searched to first identify relevant experimental cardiac arrest animal models published within the last 20 years. Based on this, a list of interventions was created and a second search was performed to identify clinical trials testing one of these interventions. Data extraction was performed using standardised data extraction forms. RESULTS: We identified 415 animal studies testing 190 different pharmacological interventions. The most commonly tested interventions were classified as vasopressors, anaesthetics/gases, or interventions aimed at molecular targets. We found 43 clinical trials testing 26 different interventions identified in the animal studies. Of these, 13 trials reported positive findings and 30 trials reported neutral findings with regards to the primary endpoint. No study showed harm of the intervention. Some interventions tested in human clinical trials, had previously been tested in animal studies without a positive effect on outcomes. A large number of animal studies was performed after publication of a clinical trial. CONCLUSION: Numerous different pharmacological interventions have been tested in experimental animal models. Despite this only a limited number of these interventions have advanced to clinical trials, however several of the clinical trials tested interventions that were first tested in experimental animal models.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Having a service dog can help to increase independence and well-being among people with a disability or a chronic health condition. Although there has been an increasing use of service dogs among children and youth their impact has not yet been synthesized. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article was to conduct a systematic review assessing the impact of service dogs on children, youth and their families. METHODS: Systematic searches of seven international databases from 1985 to 2020 led to 29 studies meeting our inclusion criteria. Using a narrative synthesis review approach we analyzed these studies regarding their sample characteristics, methods, results and quality of evidence. RESULTS: There were 29 studies in our review that included 1121 children and youth (or parents representing them) that spanned across six countries over a 32-year period. Although the outcomes of the impact of service dogs varied across the studies, 23/29 of them reported an improvement in at least one of the following: physical health (i.e., diabetes management, seizure management, mobility), psychological health (i.e., quality of life, safety, behavior, stress, anxiety, self-confidence and independence), social well-being (i.e., social interactions, school and work) and dog-owner-bond. Children, youth and their parents also described several challenges in owning a service dog. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that service dogs have potential to provide many benefits for children, youth and their families. Further research, including more rigorously designed studies, is needed to fully understand their impact.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Despite inter-individual variations in their diagnostic efficiency, dogs have been trained to investigate many human pathologies, especially cancer, diabetes, migraine, seizures and even infectious diseases. To this end, we performed a critical review and pooled analysis of current scientific literature on the performance of dogs trained for identifying severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive human specimens. METHODS: We carried out an electronic search in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science with the keywords "dog(s)" AND "sniffer" OR "scent" OR "smell" AND "SARS-CoV-2" OR "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" OR "coronavirus disease 2019" OR "COVID-19" within all fields, without date or language restrictions, to identify studies describing dogs' performance for identifying SARS-CoV-2 infected material. RESULTS: Three studies could be finally included in pooled analysis, totaling 17 dogs (47\% females), aged between 0.5 and 12 years. The pooled diagnostic sensitivity was 0.88 (95\% CI, 0.84-0.91; I (2), 85.3\%), the diagnostic specificity 0.99 (95\% CI, 0.99-0.99; I (2), 97.4\%), whilst the area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC) was 0.979 (standard error, 0.003).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cryptosporidiosis is an emerging infectious disease of public health significance worldwide. The burden of disease caused by Cryptosporidium varies between and within countries/areas. To have a comprehensive understanding of epidemiological status and characteristics of human Cryptosporidium infection in China since the first report in 1987, a retrospective epidemiological analysis was conducted by presenting differences in the prevalence of Cryptosporidium by province, year, population, living environment and season and possible transmission routes and risk factors as well as genetic characteristics of Cryptosporidium in humans. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A systematic search was conducted to obtain epidemiological papers of human Cryptosporidium infection/cryptosporidiosis from PubMed and Chinese databases. Finally, 164 papers were included in our analysis. At least 200,054 people from 27 provinces were involved in investigational studies of Cryptosporidium, with an average prevalence of 2.97\%. The prevalence changed slightly over time. Variable prevalences were observed: 0.65-11.15\% by province, 1.89-47.79\% by population, 1.77-12.87\% and 0-3.70\% in rural and urban areas, respectively. The prevalence peak occurred in summer or autumn. Indirect person-to-person transmission was documented in one outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in a pediatric hospital. 263 Cryptosporidium isolates were obtained, and seven Cryptosporidium species were identified: C. hominis (48.3\%), C. andersoni (22.43\%), C. parvum (16.7\%), C. meleagridis (8.36\%), C. felis (3.04\%), C. canis (0.76\%) and C. suis (0.38\%). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCES: This systematic review reflects current epidemiological status and characteristics of Cryptosporidium in humans in China. These data will be helpful to develop efficient control strategies to intervene with and prevent occurrence of human Cryptosporidium infection/cryptosporidiosis in China as well as have a reference effect to other countries. Further studies should focus on addressing a high frequency of C. andersoni in humans and a new challenge with respect to cryptosporidiosis with an increasing population of elderly people and patients with immunosuppressive diseases.},

The review process involved a search of five databases, from which 161 records were retrieved. Following this, the screening process revealed seven articles eligible for appraisal. These studies investigated seven different interventions, six being cohort-level workshops/courses and one being a collation of several individual strategies. All seven studies reported that the interventions were effective to some degree in improving the mental health of their participants.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by suppressed fibrinolytic activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) attributed to elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Restoring pulmonary fibrinolysis by delivering tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), and plasmin could be a promising approach. OBJECTIVES: To systematically analyze the overall benefit of fibrinolytic therapy for ALI reported in preclinical studies. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CNKI Chinese databases, and analyzed data retrieved from 22 studies for the beneficial effects of fibrinolytics on animal models of ALI. RESULTS: Both large and small animals were used with five routes for delivering tPA, uPA, and plasmin. Fibrinolytics significantly increased the fibrinolytic activity both in the plasma and BALF. Fibrin degradation products in BALF had a net increase of 408.41 ng/ml vs controls (P {\textless} 0.00001). In addition, plasma thrombin-antithrombin complexes increased 1.59 ng/ml over controls (P = 0.0001). In sharp contrast, PAI-1 level in BALF decreased 21.44 ng/ml compared with controls (P {\textless} 0.00001). Arterial oxygen tension was improved by a net increase of 15.16 mmHg, while carbon dioxide pressure was significantly reduced (11.66 mmHg, P = 0.0001 vs controls). Additionally, fibrinolytics improved lung function and alleviated inflammation response: the lung wet/dry ratio was decreased 1.49 (P {\textless} 0.0001 vs controls), lung injury score was reduced 1.83 (P {\textless} 0.00001 vs controls), and BALF neutrophils were lesser (3 × 10(4)/ml, P {\textless} 0.00001 vs controls). The mortality decreased significantly within defined study periods (6 h to 30 days for mortality), as the risk ratio of death was 0.2-fold of controls (P = 0.0008). CONCLUSION: We conclude that fibrinolytic therapy may be effective pharmaceutic strategy for ALI in animal models.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have focused on stem cell-based treatments for rotator cuff disorders; however, the outcomes are not consistent. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to evaluate the effects of stem cells on rotator cuff healing. METHODS: A detailed search of relevant studies was conducted in three databases including Pubmed/ Medline, Cochrane library, and Embase databases, using the following keywords: "rotator cuff" or "Tissue Engineering" AND "stem cell" from inception to January 01, 2019. The standard mean difference (SMD) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) for each individual study were extracted from the original studies or calculated based on relevant data and pooled to obtain integrated estimates using random effects modeling. RESULTS: A total of 22 studies were identified. The results demonstrated that the ultimate strain in the stem cell group was significantly higher than that in the control group at 4 and 8 weeks. Muscle weight in the stem cell group was higher than the control group at 8 weeks, while no significant differences were detected at 16 weeks. The stem cell group had lower visual analog scale scores (VAS) at 1, 3, and 6 months, and higher American shoulder and elbow surgeons score (ASES) at 3 months. In addition, the walking distance, time, and speed in the stem cell group were significantly superior to those in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis confirms that stem cells improved the rehabilitation of rotator cuff disorders. However, larger-scale studies are needed to further support these findings.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Laparoscopic intraperitoneal onlay mesh in hernia repair can result in adhesions leading to intestinal obstruction and fistulation. The aim of this systematic review is to compare the effects of mesh coatings reducing the tissue-to-mesh adhesion in animal studies. METHODS: Pubmed and Embase were systematically searched. Animal experiments comparing intraperitoneally placed meshes with coatings were eligible for inclusion. Only studies with comparable follow-up, measurements, and species were included for data pooling and subsequent meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 131 articles met inclusion criteria, with four studies integrated into one comparison and five studies integrated into another comparison. Compared to uncoated polypropylene (PP) mesh, PP mesh coated with hyaluronic acid/carboxymethyl cellulose (HA/CMC) showed significantly reduced adhesion formation at follow-up of 4 weeks measured with adhesion score of extent (random effects model, mean difference,-  0.96, 95\% CI - 1.32 to - 0.61, P {\textless} 0.001, I(2) = 23\%; fixed effects model, mean difference,- 0.94, 95\% CI - 1.25 to - 0.63, P {\textless} 0.001, I(2) = 23\%). Compared to PP mesh, polyester mesh coated with collagen (PC mesh) showed no significant difference at follow-up of 4 weeks regarding percentage of adhesion-area on a mesh, using random effects model (mean difference - 11.69, 95\% CI - 44.14 to 20.76, P = 0.48, I(2) = 92\%). However, this result differed using fixed effects model (mean difference - 25.55, 95\% CI - 33.70 to - 7.40, P {\textless} 0.001, I(2) = 92\%). CONCLUSION: HA/CMC coating reduces adhesion formation to PP mesh effectively at a follow-up of 4 weeks, while the anti-adhesive properties of PC mesh are inclusive comparing all study data.},

	abstract = {Various researches have reported that the application of topical insulin improves wound healing. Considering the lack of a quantitative comprehensive research on this matter, we conducted a meta-analysis of clinical research and experimental animal studies. Prospective and randomized controlled trials of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were conducted using appropriate search strategies to compare the effectiveness of topical application of saline and insulin on wounds. The standardized mean difference was calculated as follows: wound healing time, wound healing rate, wound area, and the percentage of wound contraction. Each study used the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and RevMan 5.3 software to create aggregated assessments and forest plots. The quality of evidence was evaluated in accordance with the methods of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group. Four clinical and nine animal studies eligible for inclusion were included in the meta-analysis. The assessments for clinical studies were as follows: wound healing time, -2.48 [-3.44, -1.51] and wound healing rate, 22.23 [18.17, 26.28]. Meanwhile, for animal studies, the following assessments were noted: wound healing time, -1.27 [-1.75, -0.79]; wound contraction rate, 15.91 [13.88, 17.95]; and wound area, -19.3 [-21.16, -17.44]. For the measurement of the following results, only one animal study was performed, pericyte recruitment of microvessels. Based on the analysis, it can be preliminarily judged that application of topical insulin can aid wound healing.},

However, their pooled effects for dopaminergic neuron have yet to be described. Objective: To review the neuroprotective effect of naïve BMSCs in rodent models of PD. Methods: The PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched up to September 30, 2020. Inclusion criteria according to PICOS criteria were as follows: (1) population: rodents; (2) intervention: unmodified BMSCs; (3) comparison: not specified; (4) primary outcome: tyrosine hydroxylase level in the substantia nigra pars compacta and rotational behavior; secondary outcome: rotarod test, and limb function; (5) study: experimental studies. Multiple prespecified subgroup and meta-regression analysis were conducted. Following quality assessment, random effects models were used for this meta-analysis. Results: Twenty-seven animal studies were included. The median quality score was 4.7 (interquartile range, 2-8). Overall standardized mean difference between animals treated with naïve BMSCs and controls was 2.79 (95\% confidence interval: 1.70, 3.87; P {\textless} 0.001) for densitometry of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive staining; -1.54 (95\% confidence interval: -2.11, -0.98; P {\textless} 0.001) for rotational behavior. Significant heterogeneity among studies was observed. Conclusions: Results of this meta-analysis suggest that naïve BMSCs therapy increased dopaminergic neurons and ameliorated behavioral deficits in rodent models of PD.},

	abstract = {Allergic asthma is thought to arise from an imbalance of immune regulation, which is characterized by the production of large quantities of IgE antibodies by B cells and a decrease of the interferon-P/interleukin-4 (Th1/Th2) ratio. Certain immunomodulatory components and Chinese herbal formulae have been used in traditional herbal medicine for thousands of years. However, there are few studies performing evidence-based Chinese medicine (CM) research on the mechanisms and efficacy of these drugs in allergic asthma. This review aims to explore the roles of Chinese herbal formulae and herb-derived compounds in experimental research models of allergic asthma. We screened published modern CM research results on the experimental effects of Chinese herbal formulae and herb-derived bioactive compounds for allergic asthma and their possible underlying mechanisms in English language articles from the PubMed and the Google Scholar databases with the keywords allergic asthma, experimental model and Chinese herbal medicine. We found 22 Chinese herb species and 31 herb-derived anti-asthmatic compounds as well as 12 Chinese herbal formulae which showed a reduction of airway hyperresponsiveness, allergen-specific immunoglobulin E, inflammatory cell infiltration and a regulation of Th1 and Th2 cytokines in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo, respectively. Chinese herbal formulae and herb-derived bioactive compounds exhibit immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-asthma activities in different experimental models and their various mechanisms of action are being investigated in modern CM research with genomics, proteomics and metabolomics technologies, which will lead to a new era in the development of new drug discovery for allergic asthma in CM.},

The lung is one of the most commonly encountered sites of Scedosporium infection. Due to its very high levels of antifungal resistance, surgery has been recommended as an important part in the treatment of pulmonary Scedosporium spp infection, even in immunocompetent cases. However, whether lung surgery could help to reduce the risk of death in immunocompetent patients is not clear.We retrospectively retrieved the records of pulmonary infections with Scedosporium species in immunocompetent patients through a comprehensive literature search. The association of surgery on all-cause mortality was explored using binary logistic regression (BLR). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was carried out to evaluate the capability of the model.The comprehensive searching strategy yielded 33 case reports and 3 case series in total, with 40 individual patients being included. The overall mortality was 12.50\%. The fatality rate was 9.09\% (2/22) in cases with surgery and 16.67\% (3/18) in cases without surgery (odds ratio, 0.50; 95\% confidence interval, 0.07-3.38; P = .48). Consistently, BLR analysis identified no statistical association between surgery and reduced mortality (odds ratio, 1.19; 95\% confidence interval, 0.09-15.64; P = .89), after adjusting for age, gender, and antifungal chemotherapy. The area under the ROC curve was 0.88.For immunocompetent patients with pulmonary Scedosporium spp infection, surgical therapy may not be associated with reduced mortality.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We sought to identify common ion channel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the occurrence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) to predict the incidence of SCD in clinical settings. METHODS: This study involved a systematic review and meta-analysis of ion channel SNPs and risk of SCD in adults. We searched public databases for studies published up to September 19, 2017. We examined relationships between SNPs in common ion channel genes and the incidence of SCD. RESULTS: We collected data for 22 trials that included a total of 4149 patients who experienced SCD or had a high risk of SCD and assessed these data in our meta-analysis. An allelic model showed that rs11720524 in SCN5A clearly protected against SCD (odds ratio [OR]: 0.76; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI]: 0.67-0.85; P {\textless} .001). Subgroup analysis showed that rs11720524 in SCN5A protected against SCD in Europeans and Caucasians but not in Koreans. The allelic model indicated that rs12296050 in KCNQ1 also had significant protective effects against SCD (OR: 0.85; 95\% CI: 0.76-0.96; P = .007). Moreover, this model demonstrated that rs2283222 in KCNQ1 had a significant negative relationship with SCD (OR: 0.73; 95\% CI: 0.62-0.85; P {\textless} .001). Rs12296050 in KCNQ1 protected against SCD in Koreans and Americans. Our results also showed that rs790896 in RYR2 was negatively associated with SCD in a dominant model (OR: 0.66; 95\% CI: 0.45-0.97; P = .033).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Restoring the shoulder function is a crucial demand of patients with rotator cuff (RC) tears. Most preclinical studies only focused on biological and mechanical measurements. Functional assessment was less investigated in the preclinical studies. This study aims to review the literature of shoulder function in animal models for RC tears and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different shoulder functional assessments and animal models. METHOD: A literature search for studies used RC tear animal models to evaluate changes in shoulder function was performed. We searched databases of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to September 2019. Animal species, functional parameters, injury and repair types, and study durations were summarised. Cluster analyses were then used to separate animal models with different levels of injury and timings of repair. The reliability and clinical relevance of the included assessments and animal models were then discussed. RESULTS: Fourteen animal studies that related to shoulder function in animal models of RC tears were reviewed. Five methods (gait analysis, passive range of motion test, open field test, staircase test, and running endurance test) to assess shoulder function were identified. Single or massive RC tendon tears and immediate or delayed RC repair models were found. We reported and discussed factors to be considered when researchers would select assessments and animal models for different study purposes. CONCLUSION: Based on current evidences, gait analysis is the most appropriate method to assess changes in shoulder function of animal models of RC tears. More studies are required to further elucidate the reliability of passive range of motion measurement, open field test, staircase test, and running endurance test. Models that use massive tears and delayed repair better represent the clinical condition found in humans. THE TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THIS ARTICLE: Using more clinically relevant animal models and assessments for shoulder function identified in this review may help to investigate the value of preclinical researches and promote translation of preclinical interventions into clinical practices.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between livestock exposure and MRSA carriage. Pooled risk estimates were calculated using fixed-effects or random-effects models based on homogeneity analysis. A dose-response meta-analysis based on linear and non-linear regression was performed to explore the frequency-risk relationship between livestock exposure and MRSA carriage. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore sources of heterogeneity among eligible studies. A total of 25 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Livestock exposure was significantly associated with an increased risk of MRSA carriage [odds ratio (OR) = 7.03, 95\% confidence interval 4.29-11.52], and similar positive associations were observed for pig (OR = 11.41), poultry (OR = 6.20) and cattle (OR = 5.66) exposure. Regarding studies on ordinal and continuous frequency of livestock exposure, a monotonically increasing frequency-risk relationship between livestock (or pig) exposure and MRSA carriage was consistently observed. This study found a monotonically increasing frequency-risk relationship between livestock exposure and MRSA carriage, which provides evidence for potential livestock-to-human transmission of MRSA.},

	abstract = {Meat products are commonly regarded as one of the main sources of human listeriosis caused by Listeria monocytogenes. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in a range of meat products from 24 different Chinese regions by using meta-analysis of literature data and a novel sensitivity analysis approach. A total of 112 publications from five databases, published between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2017, were systematically selected for relevance and covered meat products sampled between 2000 and 2016. Estimated by the random-effects model, the pooled prevalence of L. monocytogenes was 8.5\% (95\% CI: 7.1\%-10.3\%) in raw meats and 3.2\% (95\% CI: 2.7\%-3.9\%) in ready-to-eat (RTE) meats. The prevalence differed from high to low among raw meats including prefabricated raw meats 12.6\% (95\% CI: 6.9\%-21.7\%), fresh pork 11.4\% (95\% CI: 8.6\%-14.9\%), fresh beef 9.1\% (95\% CI: 6.3\%-13.0\%), fresh poultry 7.2\% (95\% CI:4.9\%-10.4\%), frozen raw meats 7.2\% (95\% CI: 5.7\%-9.0\%), and fresh mutton 5.4\% (95\% CI: 2.5\%-11.0\%). A higher L. monocytogenes prevalence level was shown in the meat products from central and northeastern China provincial regions. The entropy-based sensitivity analysis utilized in the meta-analysis indicated that the sampling period and location were two critical factors influencing the prevalence level of L. monocytogenes in meat products. A better understanding of differences in prevalence levels per geographic region and between meat product sources may allow the competent authorities, industry, and other relevant stakeholders to tailor their interventions to control the occurrence of L. monocytogenes in meat products effectively.},

	abstract = {Background: Vaccine-development research is proliferating making it difficult to determine the most promising vaccine candidates. Exemplary of this problem is vaccine development against Chlamydia, a pathogen of global public health and financial importance.Methods: We systematically extracted data from studies that included chlamydial load or host immune parameter measurements, estimating 4,453 standardized effect sizes between control and chlamydial immunization experimental groups.Results: Chlamydial immunization studies most often used (78\%) laboratory mouse models. Depending on chlamydial species, single and multiple recombinant protein, viral and bacterial vectors, dendritic transfer, and dead whole pathogen were most effective at reducing chlamydial load. Immunization-driven decrease in chlamydial load was associated with increases in IFNg, IgA, IgG1, and IgG2a. Using data from individual studies, the magnitude of IgA and IgG2a increase was correlated with chlamydial load reduction. IFNg also showed this pattern for C. trachomatis, but not for C. muridarum. We also reveal the chlamydial vaccine development field to be highly bias toward studies showing these effects, limiting lessons learned from negative results.Conclusions: Most murine immunizations against Chlamydia reduced chlamydial load and increased host immune parameters. These methods are novel for vaccine development and are critical in identifying trends where large quantities of literature exist.},

A total of 67 scientific articles published in peer-reviewed journals from 1951 to 2018 were selected for revision. Results indicate that the number of publications has increased per decade but there are years in which no articles were published. Most studies addressed Leptospira, rabies, hantavirus, Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) and distemper. Rodentia, Carnivora, Chiroptera and Cetartiodactyla were the most studied mammal orders. Information about presence/absence of pathogens was found for 44 wild mammal species. Research was mainly carried out in central and southern Chile and the most commonly employed methods for pathogen diagnosis were serology and molecular techniques. Overall, research in wild mammals has been directed towards the evaluation of zoonotic diseases, while vector-borne and non-zoonotic diseases have been mostly neglected by the scientific community over the years.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chagas disease is a major public health problem in Latin America. A neglected disease of poor and rural Latin American populations, it has now emerged in other regions and urban areas due to international migration. In Colombia, systematic data pertaining to the disease's magnitude in the general population and its distribution within regions are lacking. Our objective is to describe the prevalence of Chagas disease in Colombia through a meta-analysis and systematic review. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search using several electronic databases, gray literature, and reference lists of selected articles for population-based studies on Chagas disease prevalence in Colombia was performed between 1990 and 2017. Articles published in either English or Spanish were included. Pooled prevalence estimates and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for Chagas disease in the general population using a meta-analysis random-effects model. Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity among studies. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine whether publication bias existed. RESULTS: Seventeen articles with relevant prevalence data were identified from a total of 1213 references. The initial pooled estimate of Chagas disease prevalence across studies for the entire period was 4.10\% (95\% CI: 2.23-7.41). After removing studies with large effect and small sample sizes, the pooled estimate was 1.67\% (95\% CI: 0.95-2.92). A high degree of heterogeneity in most pooled estimates was observed, even after subgroup analysis. The Orinoquía region, rural areas, males, and persons aged ≥15 years yielded the highest pooled prevalence. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: Higher prevalence was observed in select regions, rural areas, and older teenagers and adults. Additional population-based studies within Colombia are recommended to provide more stable and reliable estimates and identify high-risk areas and groups.},

	doi = {10.1111/edt.12365},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Tooth avulsion consists of the complete displacement of a tooth from the alveolar socket. When immediate replantation is not possible, the avulsed tooth should be kept in a storage medium capable of maintaining the viability of periodontal ligament (PDL) cells on the root surface. However, there is no consensus on the best storage medium able to prevent sequels such as ankylosis and tooth resorption. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review to evaluate the in vivo effectiveness of different storage media for avulsed teeth. METHODS: Two reviewers performed a database search for studies published between January 1950 and December 2015 which were indexed in the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Bireme databases. An additional manual search was performed. Studies with animal models that evaluated tooth avulsion, storage media, and replantation were included. After full-text analysis of the potentially relevant studies, the selected studies were included in the systematic review. RESULTS: The database search found 157 distinct studies evaluating avulsed teeth storage media. However, only six studies met the selection criteria and were included in the review. There was a high variability in the study estimates for the parameters analyzed. When assessing the quality and level of evidence of each study, one study was rated as having a very low level of evidence, four studies had low levels of evidence, and one had a moderate level of evidence. CONCLUSION: As a result of data heterogeneity and limitations of the studies, there was insufficient evidence to determine the most effective storage medium for avulsed teeth.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The socket seal surgery (SSS) technique is a common alternative for the management of the post-extraction sockets that requires a primary closure of the wound to promote proper regeneration and ridge preservation. OBJECTIVE: To learn about the effect of different SSS techniques on alveolar ridge preservation MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two independent and calibrated reviewers conducted an electronic search in PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science for randomized clinical trials (RCT) published up to June 2020. The evaluation of the risk of bias in the included studies was carried out following the Cochrane manual for interventions of systematic reviews, version 5.1.0. A meta-analysis of ridge width changes at - 1, - 3, and - 5 mm cutoff points from bone crest was conducted using a random-effects model. The risk of types I and II errors against accrued data was appraised obtaining the required information size using a trial sequential analysis package (TSA). RESULTS: A total of 135 sockets located in the esthetic zone were evaluated with a minimum of a 3-month follow-up after tooth extraction in 6 RCTs. The evaluated SSS techniques were free gingival graft (FGG), collagen matrix (CM), collagen sponge (CS), acellular dermal matrix (ADM), and polytetrafluoroethylene membrane (PTFEm). The FGG in sockets without bone filling showed significant results in preserving both buccal and lingual bone height (- 1.42 mm in the experimental group versus - 0.01 in the control group). The comparison of CM and FGG with bone filling did not show clinical differences in terms of dimensional bone changes. No clinical differences were found in either width or gingival thickness when comparing CM and CS. The meta-analyses of RW changes comparing CM versus FGG showed no significant differences, but a trend for lessening horizontal reduction at - 1, - 3, and - 5 mm in favor of FGG. The TSA showed that accrued data did not reach the required information size, and more evidence is required for clinical significance inferences. CONCLUSIONS: There are several predictable SSS techniques to improve clinical results in ridge preservation. More clinical studies in the form of clinical trials are required to demonstrate the superiority of one technique over another.},

	abstract = {Milk and dairy product consumption has been associated with an increase in prostate cancer risk; however, discrepancies have been observed in the literature. This first overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses was carried out with the main objective of compiling and discussing the evidence generated to date related to milk and dairy product consumption and prostate cancer risk and mortality. A systematic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Web of Science (from inception to 30 April 2018) was conducted. The inclusion criteria were as follows: adult men, meta-analyses of longitudinal studies, dairy product consumption, and risk of prostate cancer or related outcomes. The AMSTAR2 checklist was used to evaluate methodological quality. The synthesis methods included dairy product exposure (high compared with low consumption or dose-response), dairy product type (total dairy products, milk, cheese, yogurt, and others), and prostate cancer outcomes (total, nonadvanced, and advanced prostate cancer and mortality) displayed in forest plots. Six meta-analyses were identified. These studies reported on the analysis of the 2 to 32 cohorts (up to 848,395 subjects/38,107 cases; 4-28 y of follow-up) and 2 case-control meta-analyses (12,435 subjects). The meta-analysis quality was valued as mostly "good" according to the AMSTAR2 criteria. All RRs of high compared with low consumption (dose-response) for total prostate cancer ranged from 1.68 to 1.09 (1.07 per 400 g/d) for total dairy products, 1.50 to 0.92 (1.06 to 0.98 per 200 g/d) for milk (whole, low-fat, and skim milk considered separately), and 1.18 to 0.74 (1.10 per 50 g/d) for cheese. RRs have decreased since the first meta-analysis. Statistical heterogeneity generates uncertainty in the observed results (up to I2 = 77.1\%). In conclusion, although there are some data indicating that higher consumption of dairy products could increase the risk of prostate cancer, the evidence is not consistent.

New work is emerging related to SARS-CoV-2; previous work has been conducted on other coronaviruses that affect different species. We reviewed the literature on host genetic factors related to coronaviruses, systematically focusing on human studies. We identified 1,832 articles of potential relevance. Seventy-five involved human host genetic factors, 36 of which involved analysis of specific genes or loci; aside from one meta-analysis, all were candidate-driven studies, typically investigating small numbers of research subjects and loci. Three additional case reports were described. Multiple significant loci were identified, including 16 related to susceptibility (seven of which identified protective alleles) and 16 related to outcomes (three of which identified protective alleles). The types of cases and controls used varied considerably; four studies used traditional replication/validation cohorts. Among other studies, 30 involved both human and non-human host genetic factors related to coronavirus, 178 involved study of non-human (animal) host genetic factors related to coronavirus, and 984 involved study of non-genetic host factors related to coronavirus, including involving immunopathogenesis. Previous human studies have been limited by issues that may be less impactful now, including low numbers of eligible participants and limited availability of advanced genomic methods; however, these may raise additional considerations. We outline key genes and loci from animal and human host genetic studies that may bear investigation in the study of COVID-19. We also discuss how previous studies may direct current lines of inquiry.},

No published systematic reviews have evaluated the totality of research examining the effects of exercise on implicit memory function, which was the purpose of this systematic review. METHODS: Databases (PubMed, PsychInfo, and Sports Discus) were searched to evaluate animal and human experimental studies evaluating the effects of exercise on implicit memory function. RESULTS: Among the 10 evaluated studies that met inclusionary criteria for this systematic review, 7 were conducted in animal models (rats or mice), with 3 utilizing human samples. Among the seven animal model studies, all employed a fear conditioning paradigm to evaluate implicit memory performance. All six animal studies employing a chronic exercise paradigm demonstrated evidence for associations between chronic exercise and enhanced fear conditioning. The one animal study evaluating a high-intensity acute bout of exercise showed that high-intensity acute exercise worsened implicit memory retrieval. Among the three human studies, one demonstrated a beneficial effect of acute exercise on implicit memory function. DISCUSSION: There is consistent evidence in animal models that chronic exercise enhances implicit memory, as assessed by fear conditioning. However, there have been too few human studies investigating this topic to render any meaningful conclusions regarding the relationship between exercise and cognitive-based implicit memory among humans.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper was to systematically evaluate the potential preventive and therapeutic effects of exercise in attenuating stress-induced memory impairment. A systematic review was employed, searching PubMed, PsychInfo, Sports Discus and Google Scholar databases. For eligibility, studies had to be published in English, employ an experimental design, have the acute or chronic bout of exercise occur prior to, during or after the stressor, implement a psychophysiological stressor, and have an assessment of memory function occurring after the stressor. In total, 23 studies were evaluated, all of which were conducted among animal models. All 23 studies employed a chronic exercise protocol and a chronic stress protocol. Eight studies evaluated a preventive model, three employed a concurrent model, ten studies employed a therapeutic model, and two studies evaluated both a preventive and therapeutic model within the same study. Among the eight studies employing a preventive model, all eight demonstrated that the stress regimen impaired memory function. In all eight of these studies, when exercise occurred prior to the stressor, exercise attenuated the stress-induced memory impairment effect. Among the ten studies employing a therapeutic model, one study showed that the stress protocol enhanced memory function, one showed that the stress protocol did not influence memory, and eight demonstrated that the stress regimen impaired memory function. Among the eight studies showing that the stress protocol impaired memory function, all eight studies demonstrated that exercise, after the stressor, attenuated stress-induced memory impairment. Within animal models, chronic stress is associated with memory impairment and chronic exercise has both a preventive and therapeutic effect in attenuating stress-induced memory impairment. Additional experimental work in human studies is needed. Such work should also examine acute exercise and stress protocols.},

The aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effectiveness of dental pulp stem cells and synthetic block complexes for bone defect treatment in preclinical in vivo articles. METHODS: The electronic database and manual search was conducted on Pubmed, Scopus, and EMBASE. The papers identified were submitted for risk-of-bias assessment and classified according to new bone formation, bone graft characteristics, dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) culture passages and amount of experimental data. The meta-analysis assessment was conducted to assess new bone formation in test sites with DPSCs/synthetic blocks vs. synthetic block alone. RESULTS: The database search identified a total of 348 papers. After the initial screening, 30 studies were included, according to the different animal models: 19 papers on rats, 3 articles on rabbits, 2 manuscripts on sheep and 4 papers on swine. The meta-analysis evaluation showed a significantly increase in new bone formation in favor of DPSCs/synthetic scaffold complexes, if compared to the control at 4 weeks (Mean Diff: 17.09\%, 95\% CI: 15.16-18.91\%, p {\textless} 0.01) and at 8 weeks (Mean Diff: 14.86\%, 95\% CI: 1.82-27.91\%, p {\textless} 0.01) in rats calvaria bone defects. CONCLUSION: The synthetic scaffolds in association of DPSCs used for the treatment of bone defects showed encouraging results of early new bone formation in preclinical animal studies and could represent a useful resource for regenerative bone augmentation procedures.},

We systematically searched PubMed/Medline, SportDiscuss, Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Scielo database on May 18, 2020. Thirty-four studies were included measuring total (mCSA) or mean muscle fibers cross-sectional area (fCSA) or maximum load-carrying capacity (MLCC) or muscle mass (MM). About the main results, LRT provides sufficient mechanical stimulation to increase mCSA and fCSA. Meta-analysis showed a significant overall effect on the fCSA (SMD 1.89, 95\% CI [1.18, 2.61], p {\textless} .00001, I(2)  = 85\%); however, subgroup analysis showed that some muscle types might not be hypertrophied through the LRT. Meta-analysis showed a significant training effect on the MM (SMD 0.92, 95\% CI [0.52, 1.32], p {\textless} .00001, I(2)  = 72\%). Sub-group analysis revealed that soleus (SMD 1.32, 95\% CI [0.11, 2.54], p = .03, I(2)  = 86\%) and FHL (SMD 1.92, 95\% CI [1.00, 2.85], p {\textless} .0001, I(2)  = 71\%) presented significant training effects, despite moderate heterogeneity levels (I(2)  = 72\%). MLCC increases considerably after a period of LRT, regardless of its duration and the characteristics of the protocols (SMD 12.37, 95\% CI [9.36, 15.37], p {\textless} .00001, I(2)  = 90\%). Through these results, we reach the following conclusions: (a) LRT is efficient to induce muscle hypertrophy, although this effect varies between different types of skeletal muscles, and; (b) the ability of rodents to carry load increases regardless of the type and duration of the protocol used.},

Among these, the use of decellularized nerve grafts has been proposed as an alternative to auto/isografts, which represent the current gold standard in the treatment of severe nerve injury. This study reports the results of a systematic review of the literature published between January 2007 and October 2017. The aim was to quantitatively analyze the effectiveness of decellularized nerve grafts in rat experimental models. The review included 33 studies in which eight different decellularization protocols were described. The decellularized nerve grafts were reported to be immunologically safe and able to support both functional and morphological regeneration after nerve injury. Chemical protocols were found to be superior to physical protocols. However, further research is needed to optimize preparation protocols, including recellularization, improve their effectiveness, and substitute the current gold standard, especially in the repair of long nerve defects.},

METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang Data, and CBM were searched for animal experiments on moxibustion intervention for rheumatoid arthritis. Related data were extracted, and RevMan 5.3 was used to perform a meta-analysis of outcome measures, including serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-17 (IL-17), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and degree of swelling of diseased joint. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies were included. The detection methods included radioimmunoassay and ELISA and the experimental animal species included rats and rabbits. The studies on serum TNF-α and degree of swelling of diseased joint had publication bias. Meta-analysis showed that the moxibustion group had significant reductions in the serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, VEGF, IL-17, and RANKL, significant increases in the serum levels of TGF-β and IFN-γ, and a significant reduction in the degree of swelling of diseased joints in model animals. CONCLUSION: Moxibustion can effectively regulate levels of the serum cytokines in experimental animals of rheumatoid arthritis and thus reduce inflammatory response and alleviate the swelling of diseased joints.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The carotid artery blood flow (CABF) or cerebral blood flow (CBF) achieved with current techniques of cardiac compression in humans are unknown. Animal experiments may provide useful information on such flows and on possible techniques to optimize them. OBJECTIVES: To obtain an estimate of carotid and cerebral blood flows during cardiac compression with different techniques. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of all studies in the English literature that measured the CABF and/or CBF during cardiac compression in experimental models of cardiac arrest, expressed as a percentage of baseline (pre-arrest) values. We compared the effect of vasopressor use, thoracic compression technique, pre-arrest infusion and animal model on maximum blood flows using standard statistical methodologies. RESULTS: Overall, 133 studies were reviewed. Of these, 45 studies provided information only on CABF; 77 only on CBF, and 11 studies on both flows. The overall weighted mean (±SD) CABF was 35.2 ± 27.7\% of baseline. Porcine studies showed lower CABF when vasopressors were used (p = 0.0002). Studies of CBF reported a weighted mean value of 66.5 ± 48.5\% of baseline. Adjunctive vasopressor therapy significantly increased CBF (p = 0.007), as did fluid administration (P = 0.049). In studies reporting both CABF and CBF, the median CABF/CBF ratio was 0.67 (range 0.21-1.96). CONCLUSIONS: During experimental cardiac compression, compared to baseline, CABF appears to decrease much more than CBF. However results should be regarded with caution. They are affected by ancillary interventions and measurement methods, variability is marked and, in experiments measuring CABF and CBF simultaneously, their ratios range well outside physiologically plausible values.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Zoonotic tuberculosis (zTB) accounts for 1.4\% of the global tuberculosis burden, with the largest disease burden in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). These populations have increased exposure to zTB due to livestock rearing practices and raw dairy consumption. This qualitative systematic literature review evaluates the quality of the literature that examines the association between human zTB in LMICs and frequent exposure to livestock and livestock products and summarizes current gaps in laboratory detection methods. METHODS: The Navigation Guide, a systematic review framework utilized to assess environmental health exposures, was used to conduct this literature review. Peer-reviewed research articles were selected and evaluated for risk of bias and quality of evidence. Only studies conducted in LMICs that mentioned livestock or livestock product exposure and had a confirmed diagnosis were eligible. RESULTS: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Reported prevalence of human zTB ranged from 0\% to 28\%, with cattle and raw dairy the primary exposures. All confirmed zTB cases were Mycobacterium bovis. Eight of the 15 studies included livestock sampling, predominantly cattle and reported prevalence of zTB between 0\% and 23\%. Laboratory methods used included nearly a dozen different culture methods and a variety of molecular methods, some of which are not appropriate for zTB. CONCLUSIONS: This review revealed the need for appropriate and standardized laboratory diagnostic methods, and large prospective studies of at-risk populations to determine exposures that lead to an increased risk of tuberculosis conversion/infection to better understand the true burden of disease. Standardized, easy to implement laboratory diagnostics is an imperative focus for this scientific field to better identify the burden of zTB. Future studies pairing livestock and human subjects will allow better characterization of the high zTB transmission areas for targeted control and prevention programmes.},

Two theories for this could be that the lower PPP locations in this study were also in areas of greater feral cat and cat colony populations, as well as were areas with less emphasis on animal welfare and animal control programs.

	abstract = {Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent and aggressive malignant brain tumour, with a poor prognosis despite available surgical and radio-chemotherapy, rising the necessity for searching alternative therapies. Several preclinical studies evaluating the efficacy of cannabinoids in animal models of GBM have been described, but the diversity of experimental conditions and of outcomes hindered definitive conclusions about cannabinoids efficacy. A search in different databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, Scopus and SciELO) was conducted during June 2019 to systematically identify publications evaluating the effects of cannabinoids in murine xenografts models of GBM. The tumour volume and number of animals were extracted, and a random effects meta-analysis of these results was performed to estimate the efficacy of cannabinoids. The impact of different experimental factors and publication bias on the efficacy of cannabinoids was also assessed. Nine publications, which satisfied the inclusion criteria, were identified and subdivided in 22 studies involving 301 animals. Overall, cannabinoid therapy reduced the fold of increase in tumour volume in animal models of GBM, when compared with untreated controls. The overall weighted standardized difference in means (WSDM) for the effect of cannabinoids was -1.399 (95\% CI: -1.900 to -0.898; P-value{\textless}0.0001). Furthermore, treatment efficacy was observed for different types of cannabinoids, alone or in combination, and for different treatment durations. Cannabinoid therapy was still effective after correcting for publication bias. The results indicate that cannabinoids reduce the tumour growth in animal models of GBM, even after accounting for publication bias.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To gain further insight on the association between human toxocariasis and epilepsy in light of the new evidence in the last years. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted without date and language restriction in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE (PubMed), Ingenta Connect, Science Direct (Elsevier), RefDoc, Scopus, HighWire, Scielo and the database of the Institute of Neuroepidemiology and Tropical Neurology of the Limoges University (IENT). Two investigators independently conducted the search up to November 2017. A pooled odds ratio (OR) was estimated using a random effects model. Meta-regression was conducted to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Database search produced 204 publications. Eleven case-control studies were included that were carried out in 13 countries worldwide. A total number of 4740 subjects were considered (2159 people with epilepsy and 2581 people without epilepsy). The overall pooled OR was 1.69 (95\% CI 1.42-2.01) for the association between epilepsy and Toxocara spp. seropositivity. A positive association was constantly reported in the restricted analysis (WB as confirmatory or diagnostic test, younger population, and population-based studies). Meta-regression showed no statistically significant association between covariates and outcome. CONCLUSION: The updated meta-analysis provides epidemiological evidence of a positive association between Toxocara seropositivity and epilepsy. New surveys supported the association, mainly population-based studies. On this basis, health strategies to reduce the impact of Toxocara spp are strongly advised. Further research should be performed to understand the physiopathological mechanisms of toxocara-associated epileptogenesis.},

	abstract = {Several animal and human studies revealed that joint and nerve mobilisations positively influence neuroimmune responses in neuromusculoskeletal conditions. However, no systematic review and meta-analysis has been performed. Therefore, this study aimed to synthesize the effects of joint and nerve mobilisation compared with sham or no intervention on neuroimmune responses in animals and humans with neuromusculoskeletal conditions. Four electronic databases were searched for controlled trials. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias, and graded the certainty of the evidence. Where possible, meta-analyses using random effects models were used to pool the results. Preliminary evidence from 13 animal studies report neuroimmune responses after joint and nerve mobilisations. In neuropathic pain models, meta-analysis revealed decreased spinal cord levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein, dorsal root ganglion levels of interleukin-1β, number of dorsal root ganglion nonneuronal cells, and increased spinal cord interleukin-10 levels. The 5 included human studies showed mixed effects of spinal manipulation on salivary/serum cortisol levels in people with spinal pain, and no significant effects on serum β-endorphin or interleukin-1β levels in people with spinal pain. There is evidence that joint and nerve mobilisations positively influence various neuroimmune responses. However, as most findings are based on single studies, the certainty of the evidence is low to very low. Further studies are needed.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is a significant source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and beef cattle are particularly emissions intensive. GHG emissions are typically expressed as a carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) 'carbon footprint' per unit output. The 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP(100)) is the most commonly used CO(2)e metric, but others have also been proposed, and there is no universal reason to prefer GWP(100) over alternative metrics. The weightings assigned to non-CO(2) GHGs can differ significantly depending on the metric used, and relying upon a single metric can obscure important differences in the climate impacts of different GHGs. This loss of detail is especially relevant to beef production systems, as the majority of GHG emissions (as conventionally reported) are in the form of methane (CH(4)) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O), rather than CO(2). This paper presents a systematic literature review of harmonised cradle to farm-gate beef carbon footprints from bottom-up studies on individual or representative systems, collecting the emissions data for each separate GHG, rather than a single CO(2)e value. Disaggregated GHG emissions could not be obtained for the majority of studies, highlighting the loss of information resulting from the standard reporting of total GWP(100) CO(2)e alone. Where individual GHG compositions were available, significant variation was found for all gases. A comparison of grass fed and non-grass fed beef production systems was used to illustrate dynamics that are not sufficiently captured through a single CO(2)e footprint. Few clear trends emerged between the two dietary groups, but there was a non-significant indication that under GWP(100) non-grass fed systems generally appear more emissions efficient, but under an alternative metric, the 100-year global temperature potential (GTP(100)), grass-fed beef had lower footprints. Despite recent focus on agricultural emissions, this review concludes there are insufficient data available to fully address important questions regarding the climate impacts of agricultural production, and calls for researchers to include separate GHG emissions in addition to aggregated CO(2)e footprints.},

	abstract = {Foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks have been reported in China for many years. Recently, due to the rapid economic development, the price of meat and its demand have grown quickly. This trend has resulted in an increase in the number of livestock moving from south-east Asian countries into China. Foot and mouth disease is becoming one of the most important trans-boundary animal diseases affecting the livelihood of livestock owners in China. To contribute to the long term goal to control and eradicate FMD from China, the Chinese government has adopted a series of control measures which includes compulsory routine vaccination against the disease. In this paper, the surveillance results of the routine vaccination programme were systemically reviewed. The results from 28 published papers were combined and analysed through a meta-analysis approach. The results of the meta-analysis indicated that the vaccination programme has been very successful in China with more than 70\% of animals protected against serotypes Asia-1 and O.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted to assess production responses before 90 d in milk (DIM) when bovine somatotropin (bST) administration was initiated between 5 and 35 DIM. The database was developed from 13 studies of multiparous cows that were published between 1985 and 2006 and from an unpublished study that complied with the study selection criteria. The database included results from 842 cows and provided 50 treatment means for the effect of bST on 3.5\% fat-corrected milk (FCM) in early lactation. Effects of bST were investigated using mixed model procedures that included fixed (intercept and slope) and random (intercept and slope) effects for independent variables. Yields of milk (38.6 +/- 1.3 kg/d) and FCM (37.6 +/- 1.6 kg/d) by control cows before 90 DIM were increased by 2.6 +/- 0.8 and 3.2 +/- 0.6 kg/d by bST administration. Fat content in milk from bST-treated cows was 0.31 +/- 0.10 percentage units greater than that from control cows (3.46 +/- 0.13\%) but milk protein content (2.95 +/- 0.03\%) was not altered by bST. Milk fat (1.39 +/- 0.10 kg/d) and protein (1.15 +/- 0.04 kg/d) yields by controls were increased 0.16 +/- 0.03 and 0.07 +/- 0.03 kg/d by bST, respectively. Dry matter intake and body weight loss were not altered by bST before 90 DIM, but duration of negative energy balance was prolonged and overall energy balance during this interval reduced when cows were treated with bST. Results are consistent with the premise that bST-treated cows partition nutrients and energy toward milk synthesis for a longer duration and thus likely need a longer interval to replenish their body reserves than cows not treated with bST. Production responses to bST were not altered when cows consumed typical early-lactation diets supplemented with fat except that supplemental fat tended to decrease the magnitude of the effect of bST on milk fat content and decreased the effect of bST on fat and protein yield. Yield of FCM increased curvilinearly with the amount of bST administered. Results indicate that initiation of bST administration to cows before 35 DIM increased FCM yield but the response was at the low end of that typically observed when bST administration is initiated in wk 9 of lactation.},

However, PTB in free-living and captive wildlife has not been as extensively studied as in livestock. We reviewed the existing literature references on MAP to (i) determine the potential impact of MAP infection in wildlife species; (ii) analyze whether wildlife reservoirs are relevant regarding MAP control in domestic ruminants; (iii) assess the importance of MAP as the cause of potential interferences with tuberculosis diagnosis in wildlife. The mean MAP prevalence reported in wildlife was 2.41\% (95\% confidence interval 1.76-3.06). Although MAP should be considered an important disease in farmed cervids, its impact on free-ranging species is questionable. MAP reservoirs may exist locally but their significance for PTB control in livestock is quite limited. The most critical aspect derived of MAP infection in wildlife is the interference with tuberculosis diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Soils in many regions of the world have a low Se content. Consequently, forages and crops grown on these soils may provide inadequate dietary Se for humans and grazing animals. Selenium supplementation has been used to enhance Se status and milk Se concentration, but results conflict. Milk Se concentration appears to be a useful indicator of animal and herd Se status, and reflects the responsiveness to supplementation. A systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out to summarize all available scientific evidence for the effect of oral Se supplementation on milk Se concentration in cattle. The literature search was based on electronic and nonelectronic databases. Fixed- and random-effects models of meta-analysis were used, and a meta-regression was carried out to evaluate heterogeneity among studies. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed on 42 studies published between 1977 and 2007. Oral Se supplementation resulted in an average increase in milk Se content of 0.16 (95\% confidence interval: 0.117, 0.207) micromol/L, with a significant heterogeneity among studies. Weak publication bias was evident, but it did not change the average effect. The continent where the study was performed, Se source, Se dose, and the interaction between source and dose explained 71\% of the between-study variance. On average, American cows supplemented with Se yeast (e.g., 6 mg/h per day) had greater milk Se concentrations (approximately 0.37 micromol/L) 75 d after the beginning of supplementation when compared with those supplemented with inorganic forms of Se. This information provides a basis for tailoring daily animal requirements and for enhancing the Se intake of consumers of dairy products.},

However, a report on MRSA colonization and infection of individuals in the community, without prior contact with hospital environment, suggests the occurrence of other sources of contamination, such as the use of drugs in livestock, causing colonization of production animals with MRSA, and resulting in contamination of meat products. This study aimed at compiling and analyzing the scientific publications on the occurrence of MRSA in foods. A systematic review of the literature was performed in Lilacs, Medline and Pubmed databases, and the articles published from 2000 to 2013 were selected. A significant number of studies involving different samples was observed. Wide variations on the MRSA prevalence were found, and also on the methodologies used for the analyses. The MLST strain ST398 is commonly detected in pigs, and it was the most isolated bacterium from samples analyzed in different studies. ST8 and ST5 strains, belonging to human biovar, have also been frequently isolated, suggesting that food handlers have been a source for meat contamination with MRSA.},

Stranding response networks, governmental authorities and non-governmental organizations have established regional or national stranding networks and have developed unique standard stranding response and necropsy protocols to document and track stranded marine mammal demographics, signalment and health data. The objectives of this study were to (1) describe and review the current status of marine mammal stranding and mortality databases worldwide, including the year established, types of database and their goals; and (2) summarize the geographic range included in the database, the number of cases recorded, accessibility, filter and display methods. Peer-reviewed literature was searched, focussing on published databases of live and dead marine mammal strandings and mortality and information released from stranding response organizations (i.e. online updates, journal articles and annual stranding reports). Databases that were not published in the primary literature or recognized by government agencies were excluded. Based on these criteria, 10 marine mammal stranding and mortality databases were identified, and strandings and necropsy data found in these databases were evaluated. We discuss the results, limitations and future prospects of database development. Future prospects include the development and application of virtopsy, a new necropsy investigation tool. A centralized web-accessed database of all available postmortem multimedia from stranded marine mammals may eventually support marine conservation and policy decisions, which will allow the use of marine animals as sentinels of ecosystem health, working towards a 'One Ocean-One Health' ideal.},

Estimated size of effect of biotin was calculated for dry matter intake (DMI), milk production, and composition. Heterogeneity was not significant for all of the parameters (the highest I(2)=12\%). Therefore, fixed effects models were used for analysis. With the addition of biotin to lactating dairy cattle, DMI and milk production increased by 0.87 and 1.66 kg/d. No significant effect on percentage of milk fat and milk protein was observed. Additionally, Begg's test indicated no evidence of substantial publication bias for all variables. The influence analysis shows that the removal of any study did not change the direction or significance of the point estimates.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bibliographic data can be used to map the research quality and productivity of a discipline. We hypothesized that bibliographic data would identify geographic differences in research capacity, species specialization, and interdisciplinary relationships within the veterinary profession that corresponded with demographic and economic indices. RESULTS: Using the SCImago portal, we retrieved veterinary journal, article, and citation data in the Scopus database by year (1996-2011), region, country, and publication in species-specific journals (food animal, small animal, equine, miscellaneous), as designated by Scopus. In 2011, Scopus indexed 165 journals in the veterinary subject area, an increase from 111 in 1996. As a percentage of veterinary research output between 1996 and 2010, Western Europe and North America (US and Canada) together accounted for 60.9\% of articles and 73.0\% of citations. The number of veterinary articles increased from 8815 in 1996 to 19,077 in 2010 (net increase 66.6\%). During this time, publications increased by 21.0\% in Asia, 17.2\% in Western Europe, and 17.0\% in Latin America, led by Brazil, China, India, and Turkey. The United States had the highest number of articles in species-specific journals. As a percentage of regional output, the proportion of articles in small animal and equine journals was highest in North America and the proportion of articles in food animal journals was highest in Africa. Based on principal component analysis, total articles were highly correlated with gross domestic product (based on World Bank data). The proportion of articles in small animal and equine journals was associated with gross national income, research and development, and \% urban population, as opposed to the proportion of food animal articles, agricultural output, and \% rural population. Co-citations linked veterinary medicine with medicine in the United States, with basic sciences in Eastern Europe and the Far East, and with agriculture in most other regions and countries. CONCLUSIONS: Bibliographic data reflect the demographic changes affecting veterinary medicine worldwide and provide insight into current and changing global research capacity, specialization, and interdisciplinary affiliations. A more detailed analysis of species-specific trends is warranted and could contribute to a better understanding of educational and workforce needs in veterinary medicine.},

Only in the last three decades has the number of clinical trials increased considerably. This literature is generally not well perceived, which may be partly a consequence of the diffuse and somewhat inaccessible nature of some of the relevant research publications. The Veterinary Clinical Research Database for Homeopathy (VetCR) was launched in 2006 to provide information on existing clinical research in veterinary homeopathy and to facilitate the preparation of systematic reviews. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present report is to provide an overview of this first database on clinical research in veterinary homeopathy, with a special focus on its content of placebo controlled clinical trials and summarising what is known about placebo effects in animals. RESULTS: In April 2012, the VetCR database contained 302 data records. Among these, 203 controlled trials were identified: 146 randomised and 57 non-randomised. In 97 of those 203 trials, the homeopathic medical intervention was compared to placebo. COMMENT: A program of formal systematic reviews of peer-reviewed randomised controlled trials in veterinary homeopathy is now underway; detailed findings from the program's data extraction and appraisal approach, including the assessment of trial quality (risk of bias), will be reported in due course.},

	abstract = {Globally, large populations of companion animals are relinquished each year. The purpose of this scoping review was to identify all published research investigating companion-animal relinquishment to map out and evaluate research gaps, needs, and opportunities. A comprehensive search strategy was implemented in 4 online databases, identified citations were screened, and relevant articles were procured and characterized. From 6,848 unique citations identified, 192 were confirmed relevant, including 115 primary-research articles and 77 reviews and commentaries. The majority of these articles originated from the United States (131; 68.2\%); 74 (38.5\%) of them have been published since 2006. Among the primary-research articles, 84 (73.0\%) investigated reasons for companion-animal relinquishment. The most commonly studied reasons were aggressive companion-animal behaviors (49; 58.3\%); moving, rental, or housing issues (45; 53.6\%); and caretaker personal issues (42; 50.0\%). Only 17 primary-research articles investigated interventions to prevent companion-animal relinquishment. The quantity of research into reasons for relinquishment highlights an opportunity for future knowledge-synthesis activities in this area, including systematic review and meta-analysis. In comparison, the limited research into interventions identifies a priority for new research.},

From 1794 growth studies involving the feeding of these six test ingredients to salmonid fish, 45 studies were selected for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The relationship between SGR and the dietary inclusion level of plant-based feed ingredients was calculated using Cohen's d (CD), which measures differences between control and experimental means. The results of these meta-analyses showed an increase in the dietary inclusion of SBM, SPC, CM and CPC (not PM or PPC) leads to a significant reduction in SGR. Weighted regressions of inclusion level for each test ingredient on effect size showed significant, negative linear relationships between SGR and dietary inclusions of SBM, SPC, CM and CPC. For PM and PPC, there was no significant relationship between SGR and inclusion rate. The results suggest that the effect of plant ingredients on growth performance of salmonids depends on the specific ingredients and their inclusion levels. The higher effect sizes observed when ingredients are fed at lower inclusion levels and lack of significant impact of feeding mixed diets suggest that feeding low levels of several ingredients might be beneficial.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poultry represents an important sector in animal production, with backyard flocks representing a huge majority, especially in the developing countries. In these countries, villagers raise poultry to meet household food demands and as additional sources of incomes. Backyard production methods imply low biosecurity measures and high risk of infectious diseases, such as Newcastle disease or zoonosis such as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI).We reviewed literature on biosecurity practices for prevention of infectious diseases, and published recommendations for backyard poultry and assessed evidence of their impact and feasibility, particularly in developing countries. Documents were sourced from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) website, and from Pubmed and Google databases. RESULTS: A total of 62 peer-reviewed and non-referred documents were found, most of which were published recently (after 2004) and focused on HPAI/H5N1-related biosecurity measures (64\%). Recommendations addressed measures for flock management, feed and water management, poultry trade and stock change, poultry health management and the risk to humans. Only one general guideline was found for backyard poultry-related biosecurity; the other documents were drawn up for specific developing settings and only engaged their authors (e.g. consultants). These national guidelines written by consultants generated recommendations regarding measures derived from the highest standards of commercial poultry production. Although biosecurity principles of isolation and containment are described in most documents, only a few documents were found on the impact of measures in family poultry settings and none gave any evidence of their feasibility and effectiveness for backyard poultry. CONCLUSIONS: Given the persistent threat posed by HPAI/H5N1 to humans in developing countries, our findings highlight the importance of encouraging applied research toward identifying sustained and adapted biosecurity measures for smallholder poultry flocks in low-income countries.},

Systematic review of 37 published studies indicated that atresia coli has been diagnosed in 10 cattle breeds and 12 countries, with the marked preponderance of cases occurring in Holstein-Friesian calves (485/514 cases, 94\%). Epidemiologic analysis based on 28,373 cattle {\textless} 2 mo of age admitted to North American veterinary schools between 1964 and 1993 identified 291 cases of atresia coli in 13 breeds, with the marked preponderance of cases occurring in Holstein-Friesian calves (228/291, 78\%). Holstein-Friesian cattle were at significantly greater risk for the condition than all other dairy cattle breeds (crude odds ratio 4.55, P {\textless} 0.0001) and all other cattle breeds (crude odds ratio 7.12, P {\textless} 0.0001), whereas there was no difference in the odds ratio between dairy cattle (not Holstein-Friesian) and beef cattle (crude odds ratio 1.68, P = 0.11). Atresia coli probably occurs secondary to vascular insufficiency of the developing colon. Holstein-Friesian cattle may be genetically predisposed to atresia coli, possibly because their developing colon grows at a faster rate and/or to a greater extent than that in other cattle breeds. Early or vigorous palpation per rectum of the amniotic vesicle appears to increase the risk of atresia coli in a genetically predisposed fetus, probably through palpation-induced damage to the developing colonic vasculature.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Zoonotic disease (ZD) pose a serious threat to human health in low-income countries. In these countries the human burden of disease is often underestimated due to insufficient monitoring because of insufficient funding. Quantification of the impact of zoonoses helps in prioritizing healthcare needs. Kyrgyzstan is a poor, mountainous country with 48\% of the population employed in agriculture and one third of the population living below the poverty line. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have assessed the burden of zoonoses in Kyrgyzstan by conducting a systematic review. We have used the collected data to estimate the burden of ZDs and addressed the underestimation in officially reported disease incidence. The estimated incidences of the ZDs were used to calculate incidence-based Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). This standardized health gap measure enhances comparability between injuries and diseases. The combined burden for alveolar echinococcosis, cystic echinococcosis, brucellosis, campylobacteriosis, congenital toxoplasmosis, non-typhoidal salmonellosis and rabies in Kyrgyzstan in 2013 was 35,209 DALYs [95\% Uncertainty interval (UI):13,413-83,777]; 576 deaths [95\% UI: 279-1,168] were attributed to these infections. We estimate a combined median incidence of ZDs of 141,583 cases [95\% UI: 33,912-250,924] in 2013. The highest burden was caused by non-typhoidal Salmonella and Echinococcus multilocularis, respectively 14,792 DALYs [95\% UI: 3,966-41,532] and 11,915 DALYs [95\% UI: 4,705-27,114] per year. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The health impact of zoonoses in Kyrgyzstan is substantial, comparable to that of HIV. Community-based surveillance studies and hospital-based registration of all occurrences of zoonoses would increase the accuracy of the estimates.},

	abstract = {The aquatic environment is increasingly bombarded by a wide variety of noise pollutants whose range and intensity are increasing with each passing decade. Yet, little is known about how aquatic noise affects marine communities. To determine the implications that changes to the soundscape may have on fishes, a meta-analysis was conducted focusing on the ramifications of noise on fish behavior and physiology. Our meta-analysis identified 42 studies that produced 2,354 data points, which in turn indicated that anthropogenic noise negatively affects fish behavior and physiology. The most predominate responses occurred within foraging ability, predation risk, and reproductive success. Additionally, anthropogenic noise was shown to increase the hearing thresholds and cortisol levels of numerous species while tones, biological, and environmental noise were most likely to affect complex movements and swimming abilities. These findings suggest that the majority of fish species are sensitive to changes in the aquatic soundscape, and depending on the noise source, species responses may have extreme and negative fitness consequences. As such, this global synthesis should serve as a warning of the potentially dire consequences facing marine ecosystems if alterations to aquatic soundscapes continue on their current trajectory.},

Research studies directed toward developing vaccines against ticks are emerging. One way to evaluate those vaccines is to calculate the percentage of efficacy. The aim of this study was to analyze scientific publications archived in PubMed that used this method of assessment and discuss the main factors that may affect its calculation. Thus, 25 articles addressing this subject were selected. The percentage of efficacy was usually calculated in one of two ways, with one considering the reduced fertility of eggs and the other not. The latter method may underestimate the vaccine efficacy, and the most complete formula for calculating the efficacy reflects how much the vaccine actually affects the infestation. In our view, the use of the complete formula for calculating the percentage of efficacy is broader and more representative of the vaccine effect on the tick population.},

We divided the results into three groups: chitosan, alginate, and a combination of chitosan and alginate. Chitosan-, alginate-, and a combination of chitosan and alginate-based scaffolds showed good intervention effects on wound healing. Chitosan-based scaffolds were effective in diabetic skin wound healing. The effects of alginate and the combination of chitosan-and alginate-based scaffolds on diabetic skin wounds still need more research. However, due to the heterogeneity of animal and cell preclinical trials and the validity of the statistical analysis used in these studies, it is necessary to conduct a thorough study using well-designed experiments to confirm these results. In addition, properly designed chitosan-and/or alginate-based scaffolds with thorough preclinical evaluations are required prior to clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Cryptosporidium is the causative agent of cryptosporidiosis. Cryptosporidium not only has a worldwide distribution, but also can infect various hosts, including dairy cattle and humans. Although numerous researches on Cryptosporidium infection in cattle have been conducted, no nationwide study on the prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection in dairy cattle in mainland China was carried out. In this meta-analysis, five databases, including PubMed, ScienceDirect, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chongqing VIP, and Wanfang, were used to search for published papers regarding Cryptosporidium infection in dairy cattle in China from inception to February 25, 2019. Our study obtained 60 eligibility studies that reported Cryptosporidium infection in dairy cattle. We estimated the pooled Cryptosporidium prevalence to be 17.0\% (3,901/33,313), with 16.9\% (722/5,191) in Central China, 17.4\% (959/6,162) in Eastern China, 29.8\% (404/2,021) in Northeastern China, 15.7\% (227/2,344) in Northern China, 15.8\% (1,042/11,452) in Northwestern China, 9.5\% (494/5,758) in Southern China, and 13.7\% (53/385) in Southwestern China. The pooled prevalence of Cryptosporidium in before 2000 group (28.0\%, 944/3,417) was significantly higher than in 2000-2010 group (11.1\%, 384/3,643) and after 2010 group (13.7\%, 2,134/22,411). Cattle with the age of ≤ 12 months (22.5\%, 2,142/12,948) had a significantly higher prevalence than those of {\textgreater} 12 months (9.5\%, 840/10,282). The pooled prevalence of Cryptosporidium in different seasons ranged from 8.2\% (343/4,552) in Autumn to 19.5\% (285/1,570) in Winter. Diarrhea cattle (38\%, 133/477) had a higher Cryptosporidium prevalence than non-diarrhea cattle (13.0\%, 367/2423). The pooled prevalence of Cryptosporidium in different provinces was various, with the highest (35.6\%, 355/1,667) in Heilongjiang province, and the lowest (4.3\%, 15/440) in Tianjin province. The univariate meta-regression analyses indicated that the collection year (P = 0.002) and age of cattle (P = 0.001) might be sources of heterogeneity. This systematic review suggests that China is a country where cryptosporidiosis frequently occurs in cattle. Due to the particular relationship between dairy cattle and feeder, further research is required to investigate the links between cattle ownership and Cryptosporidium infection.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are limited findings from low-powered studies based on few number of subjects with equine asthma. Furthermore, no studies have been performed to assess a meaningful clinically detectable impact of corticosteroids in equine asthma. OBJECTIVES: To assess and compare the clinical effect of inhaled and systemic corticosteroids in equine asthma and identify a quantitative clinical score suitable to assess the Minimal Important Difference (MID), expressed as the Minimally Clinically Detectable Difference (MCDD). STUDY DESIGN: Pair-wise and network meta-analysis. METHODS: Literature searches for studies on corticosteroid therapy in equine asthma were performed. The risk of publication bias was assessed by Funnel plots and Egger's test. The effect on changes in clinical scores vs. control was analysed via random-effects models and Bayesian networks. RESULTS: Corticosteroids significantly improved the clinical condition (Standardised Mean Difference: -1.52, 95\% CrI -2.07 to -0.98; P{\textless}0.001 vs. control). No difference was detected between inhaled and systemic corticosteroids with regard to the changes in clinical scores (Relative Effect: 0.08, 95\% CrI -1.45 to 1.32; P = 0.8). An Improved clinically Detectable Equine Asthma Scoring System (IDEASS) indicated that corticosteroids improved the clinical condition of asthmatic horses by 30\% compared with controls (IDEASS value: -2.36, 95\% CI -3.39 to -1.33; P{\textless}0.001). A one-point change in IDEASS represented the MCDD in equine asthma. MAIN LIMITATIONS: Moderate quality of evidence for systemic corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled corticosteroids are effective in improving the clinical condition of horses with equine asthma and prevent exacerbations. Systemic corticosteroids should be used only in selected cases with symptomatic airway hyperresponsiveness during exacerbation. IDEASS requires further validation but may represent a suitable approach to rank the level of asthma severity and assess the clinical effect of pharmacotherapy in horses with equine asthma.},

	doi = {10.1093/nutrit/nuy029},
	abstract = {CONTEXT: Omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, demonstrate possible beneficial effects as adjuvants in cancer treatment. One mechanism seems to be related to alterations in the redox status of cancer cells. Such alterations are thought to act in synergy with conventional anticancer agents. OBJECTIVE: This review examines published data on the effects of cotreatment with anticancer agents and n-3 PUFAS on oxidative stress parameters to determine whether any patterns of oxidative stress alterations can be identified. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of MEDLINE (via PubMed) was conducted to identify articles published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese until November 2017. STUDY SELECTION: The following inclusion criteria were applied: (1) individuals or animals with cancer or malignant cell lines supplemented with some source of n-3 PUFAs; (2) concomitant use of anticancer treatment; and (3) evaluation of oxidative stress-related variables. DATA EXTRACTION: A standardized outline was used to extract the following data: study type, supplement used, type of cells, tumor or patient characteristics, study design, anticancer treatment used, and oxidative stress-related outcomes. RESULTS: After the literature search and screening of 1563 citations, 28 studies were included for data extraction and evaluation: 16 in vitro studies (2 of which also used in vivo studies), 8 animal studies, and 4 human studies (3 clinical trials and 1 case series). In most in vitro and animal studies, intervention groups receiving cotreatment with n-3 PUFAs showed enhanced lipid peroxidation and cytotoxicity compared with groups receiving anticancer treatment alone. Eleven of the 12 studies that investigated the effect of vitamin E on the sensitivity of cancer cells to the oxidative stress caused by n-3 PUFAs showed that vitamin E abolished the positive effects of cotreatment. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in oxidative stress caused by cotreatment with anticancer agents and n-3 PUFAs can exert positive effects on the efficacy of conventional treatment. This seems to occur in most cells and tumors tested thus far, but not all. Identifying tumors that are sensitive to these oxidative effects may provide support for the rational use of n-3 PUFAs as an adjuvant treatment in specific types of cancer.},

	abstract = {Background: The emergence and re-emergence of vector-borne and other infectious diseases of poverty pose a threat to the health of populations living in urban and low-income settings. A detailed understanding of intervention strategies, including effectiveness of past outbreak containment, is necessary to improve future practices. The objective was to determine what is known about the effectiveness of containment measures for emerging and re-emerging vector-borne and other infectious diseases of poverty in urban settings and identify research gaps and implications for public health practice. Main body: We conducted a scoping review and systematically searched peer-reviewed and grey literature published between 2000 and 2016. Different data extraction tools were used for data coding and extraction, and data on implementation process and transferability were extracted from all studies. A quality assessment was conducted for each included study. We screened 205 full-text articles and reports for a total of 31 articles included in the review. The quality of the studies was generally low to moderate. The largest body of evidence concerned control activities for Ebola virus and dengue fever. The majority of interventions (87\%) relied on multiple types of measures, which were grouped into four categories: (1) healthcare provision; (2) epidemiological investigation and/or surveillance; (3) environmental or sanitary interventions; and (4) community-based interventions. The quality of the majority of studies (90\%) was poor or moderate, and one-third of the studies did not provide a clear description of the outcomes and of the procedures and/or tools used for the intervention. Conclusions: Our results highlight the difficulty of establishing causation when assessing the effect of containment measures. Studies that extend beyond solely reporting on effectiveness and take into account the complexity of real-world settings are urgently needed. We recommend the allocation of research efforts to the evaluation of the implementation processes of interventions as well as their comprehensive and systematic description using validated checklists.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.vetpar.2020.109173},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal parasites like nematodes are associated with significant impacts on animal health, causing poor growth rates, diseases and even death. Traditional parasite control includes the use of anthelmintic drugs, albeit being associated with drug resistance and ecotoxicity. In the last decade, biological control of parasites using nematophagous or predatory fungi has been increasingly studied, although systematic evidence of its efficacy is still lacking. The aim of this work was to assess the evidence of efficacy of nematophagous fungi in the control of nematodes and other gastrointestinal parasites in different animal species. METHODS: Using the PICO method (Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcomes), we performed a systematic review on the subject to search for original papers published between January 2006 and October 2019, written in English, and indexed in PubMed/Medline. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms were used in the syntax. Papers were selected for detailed review based on title and abstract. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, and relevant data were collected from the remaining papers. RESULTS: The literature search retrieved 616 papers. Eighty-nine were submitted to a detailed review. In the end, 53 papers were included in the analysis. The studies were very heterogeneous, using different fungi, doses, frequency of administration, duration of treatment, host animals, and target parasites. Considering the 53 papers, 44 studies (83 \% of the interventions) showed efficacy, with only 9 studies (17 \%) showing no significant differences when compared to control. CONCLUSION: With the increasing hazards of drug resistance and ecotoxicity, biological control with predatory fungi stands out as a good tool for future parasite management, whether as a complementary treatment or as an alternative to standard parasite control.},

There is limited information about its contribution to morbidity and mortality in this population. We conducted a systematic review of scientific literature to provide an estimation of the frequency and mortality of histoplasmosis among people with HIV receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in Latin America, and factors associated with mortality. We searched articles in PubMed, Scopus, WHO Global health library, and Scielo using different combination of terms including "histoplasmosis" and HAART. We identified 949 articles, removed 662 duplicated; screened 287 abstracts; reviewed full text of 53 articles; and selected 15 articles that provided information on the number of patients studied, included patients receiving ART, and reported any measure of frequency estimate for qualitative synthesis. Studies were conducted in Argentina (n = 4), Brazil (n = 6), Colombia (n = 2), French Guyana and the Bahamas (=2), and Guatemala (n = 1). Heterogeneity of studies characteristics precluded any aggregated estimates. Histoplamosis was frequent in these cohort studies and mortality was high despite the use of HAART. Low CD4 counts, delayed HAART initiation and poor adherence were related to increased incidence, poor prognosis and increased mortality, respectively. Histoplasmosis may be an important contributor to mortality in people with HIV in Latin America. Diagnostic delays represent an important limitation for improving care of patients suspected to have histoplasmosis. Reducing histoplasmosis diagnostic delays and therapy initiation is needed to further decrease mortality.},

	abstract = {Dehorning is a common practice in cattle farming. Researchers suggest that pain during dehorning can be mitigated, although there is no conclusive evidence about the best technique and the best manner of pain relief. A systematic review-meta-analysis was performed to clarify the effect of dehorning on welfare indicators (cortisol concentration or average daily gain or vocalisation) in beef cattle up to 12 months of age. Five electronic databases were systematically searched, as well as conference proceedings and experts were contacted electronically. Pre-defined protocols were applied during all steps of the systematic review process. A random effect meta-analysis was conducted for each indicator separately with the mean of the control and treated groups. Four publications reporting seven studies and 69 trials were included in the MA involving 287 cattle. Heterogeneity between studies was observed for cortisol (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=50.5\%), average daily gain (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=70.5\%), and vocalisation (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=91.9\%). When comparing the non-dehorned group with amputation dehorning, the cortisol concentration was lower 30 min (P{\textless}0.0001) and 120 min (P=0.023) after procedure (0.767 nmol/L and 0.680 nmol/L, respectively). Local anaesthesia did not show a reduction in cortisol concentration at 30 min after dehorning by amputation. Non-dehorned animals had a tendency to decrease the number of vocalisation (P=0.081; MD=0.929) compared with the group dehorned by amputation. These results suggest that dehorning is a painful experience and that local anaesthesia did not alleviate short-term pain following dehorning. Further investigation into pain relief is required to improve confident decision making under practical conditions.},

	abstract = {Background: As growing evidence links gut microbiota with the therapeutic efficacy and side effects of anti-hyperglycemic drugs, this article aims to provide a systematic review of the reciprocal interactions between anti-hyperglycemic drugs and gut microbiota taxa, which underlie the effect of the gut microbiome on diabetic control via bug-host interactions. Method: We followed the PRISMA requirements to perform a systematic review on human vs. animal gut microbiota data in PubMed, SCOPUS, and EMBASE databases, and used Cochrane, ROBIN-I, and SYRCLE tools to assess potential bias risks. The outcomes of assessment were trends on gut microbiota taxa, diversity, and associations with metabolic control (e.g., glucose, lipid) following anti-hyperglycemic treatment. Results: Of 2,804 citations, 64 studies (17/humans; 47/mice) were included. In human studies, seven were randomized trials using metformin or acarbose in obese, pre-diabetes, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. Treatment of pre-diabetes and newly diagnosed T2D patients with metformin or acarbose was associated with decreases in genus of Bacteroides, accompanied by increases in both Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Additionally, T2D patients receiving metformin showed increases in various taxa of the order Enterobacteriales and the species Akkermansia muciniphila. Of seven studies with significant differences in beta-diversity, the incremental specific taxa were associated with the improvement of glucose and lipid profiles. In mice, the effects of metformin on A. muciniphila were similar, but an inverse association with Bacteroides was reported. Animal studies on other anti-hyperglycemic drugs, however, showed substantial variations in results. Conclusions: The changes in specific taxa and β-diversity of gut microbiota were associated with metformin and acarbose in humans while pertinent information for other anti-hyperglycemic drugs could only be obtained in rodent studies. Further human studies on anti-hyperglycemic drugs other than metformin and acarbose are needed to explore gut microbiota's role in their therapeutic efficacies and side effects.},

	abstract = {Acute benign calf myositis is a rare infection-associated syndrome presenting with calf pain that occurs in epidemics or sporadically. Epidemic cases are usually associated with influenza virus type B. Sporadic cases, however, might be associated with a large number of microorganisms. Furthermore, during an outbreak there is a great alertness that promotes earlier diagnosis. In contrast, there is likely a lower awareness regarding the sporadic form, compromising early and correct diagnosis. In order to characterize the sporadic form of acute calf myositis and increase the knowledge of this condition, we systematically reviewed the literature reporting sporadic cases. We identified 72 reports, including 451 patients, 325 males and 126 females. Sporadic acute benign calf myositis affected subjects ≤18 years of age (N = 450; 99\%), who followed a prodromal flu-like illness (N = 411; 91\%), presented with pain and tenderness affecting only the calves for ≤1½ weeks (N = 441; 99\%) and was never complicated by kidney involvement. The creatine kinase ratio was ≥10 in 310 (70\%) out of 444 cases. Microbiological studies identified an infectious trigger in 181 cases, mostly influenza virus (type B more frequently than type A), Dengue, Ebstein-Barr or Parainfluenza virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Sporadic acute benign calf myositis is a self-limited condition that can usually be diagnosed on a clinical basis. Unlike the epidemic form, many cases are due to microorganisms other than influenza virus B or A.},

	abstract = {Poultry production is an industry that generates 90,000 metric tons of chicken meat worldwide. Thus, optimizing chicken growth and sustainable production is of great importance. A central factor determining not only production parameters, but also stability of the immune system and chicken health, is the diversity and variability of the microbiota present throughout the gastrointestinal tract. To date, several studies have investigated the relationship between bacterial communities and the gut microbiome, with limited data to compare. This study aims to create a bacterial meta-analysis based on studies using amplicon sequencing with Illumina sequencing technologies in order to build a baseline for comparison in future analyses of the cecal bacterial composition in chicken. A systematic literature review was performed (SYRF ID: e84f0468-e418-4eec-9da4-b517f1b4809d). From all the available and analyzed manuscripts only nine contained full raw-sequence data available and the corresponding metadata. A total of 324 samples, comprising three different regions within the 16S rRNA gene, were analyzed. Due to the heterogeneity of the data, each region was analyzed independently and an effort for a joint analysis was performed as well. Taxonomic profiling revealed 11 phyla, with Firmicutes as the most prevalent phylum, followed by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. At genus level, 109 genera were found. Shannon metric for alpha diversity showed that factors like type of chickens (Commercial or experimental) and 16S rRNA gene subregion have negligible effect on diversity. Despite the large number of parameters that were taken into account, the identification of common bacteria showed five genera to be common for all sets in at least 50\% of the samples. These genera are highly associated to cellulose degradation and short chain fatty acids synthesis. In general, it was possible to identify some commonalities in the bacterial cecal microbial community despite the extensive variability and factors differing from one study to another.},

FTA cards® have proved useful for sample storage and latter identification of pathogens with importance for agricultural, animal and human health: however, for optimal handling, processing, and biosafety measures are not well-established. ObjectiveThis systematic review aims to summarize the reported effectiveness of FTA cards® for storage and transport of viral RNA, as well as the conditions for their handling and use in downstream processes. Finally, the biosafety measures required to protect researchers and clinical lab workers are considered. MethodsWe performed a systematic review following the PRISMA statement. We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus and Web of Science using the keywords "FTA cards" AND "RNA". Articles were screened by title and abstract, and after examination of inclusion and exclusion criteria, relevant information was extracted. The quality of the studies was assessed, and the evidence was qualitatively summarized. ResultsA total of 175 records were retrieved, and 11 additional documents were found by checking references of the eligible articles. A total of 47 articles were included. Samples from animals accounted for 38.3\% of the publications, which identified viruses that cause disease in poultry, wild birds, suids, or bovids. Three different methods for RNA extraction were reported. Other factors that vary across reports include the size of RNA amplicon, storage temperature, and duration of storage. Only fourteen articles tested the inactivation of the virus on the FTA card®, and in one case, the virus remained infective. ConclusionFTA cards® could be a suitable option for RNA virus storage and transport for fieldwork in areas where proper conditions for RNA preservation are difficult to achieve. Three different protocols have been used for RNA detection from this matrix. Biospecimens in the form of dried blood spots should be considered potentially infectious unless specifically treated to inactivate viral pathogens.},

Studies that reported data on blastomycosis mortality and that were published from inception through February 2018 were assessed and included in the analysis. Using the R meta package, a random-effect model meta-analysis was used to calculate pooled and stratified estimates of case-fatality proportions and risk ratios. Of 1553 publications, we included 20 studies reporting on a total of 2820 cases of blastomycosis between 1970 and 2014 and three case series reports with 10, 21, and 36 patients. The mean or median ages ranged from 28 to 59 years. Mortality was defined as attributable mortality caused by blastomycosis in 13 studies. Among 14 studies with a standard error ≤0.05, the overall pooled mortality was 6.6\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 4.9-8.2) with 57\% heterogeneity. The mortality rate was 37\% (95\% CI, 23-51) in immunocompromised patients and 75\% (95\% CI, 53-96) in patients who developed an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (n = 3 studies each). ARDS was the only identified risk factor in general patients (risk ratio = 10.2). The overall mortality was significantly higher in studies involving immunocompromised patients and ARDS patients. Our analysis showed considerable heterogeneity among studies. Inconsistent mortality definitions may have contributed to the observed heterogeneity.

	abstract = {Proposals to increase research reproducibility frequently call for focusing on effect sizes instead of p values, as well as for increasing the statistical power of experiments. However, it is unclear to what extent these two concepts are indeed taken into account in basic biomedical science. To study this in a real-case scenario, we performed a systematic review of effect sizes and statistical power in studies on learning of rodent fear conditioning, a widely used behavioral task to evaluate memory. Our search criteria yielded 410 experiments comparing control and treated groups in 122 articles. Interventions had a mean effect size of 29.5\%, and amnesia caused by memory-impairing interventions was nearly always partial. Mean statistical power to detect the average effect size observed in well-powered experiments with significant differences (37.2\%) was 65\%, and was lower among studies with non-significant results. Only one article reported a sample size calculation, and our estimated sample size to achieve 80\% power considering typical effect sizes and variances (15 animals per group) was reached in only 12.2\% of experiments. Actual effect sizes correlated with effect size inferences made by readers on the basis of textual descriptions of results only when findings were non-significant, and neither effect size nor power correlated with study quality indicators, number of citations or impact factor of the publishing journal. In summary, effect sizes and statistical power have a wide distribution in the rodent fear conditioning literature, but do not seem to have a large influence on how results are described or cited. Failure to take these concepts into consideration might limit attempts to improve reproducibility in this field of science.},

Here, extensive literature searches and data collection of available laboratory studies on combined toxicity data for binary mixtures of pesticides and non-chemical stressors has been performed for honey bees (Apis mellifera), wild bees (Bombus spp.) and solitary bee species (Osmia spp.). From 957 screened publications, 14 publications provided 218 binary mixture toxicity data mostly for acute mortality (lethal dose: LD(50)) after contact exposure (61\%), with fewer studies reporting chronic oral toxicity (20\%) and acute oral LC(50) values (19\%). From the data collection, available dose response data for 92 binary mixtures were modelled using a Toxic Unit (TU) approach and the MIXTOX modelling tool to test assumptions of combined toxicity i.e. concentration addition (CA), and interactions (i.e. synergism, antagonism). The magnitude of interactions was quantified as the Model Deviation Ratio (MDR). The CA model applied to 17\% of cases while synergism and antagonism were observed for 72\% (MDR {\textgreater} 1.25) and 11\% (MDR {\textless} 0.83) respectively. Most synergistic effects (55\%) were observed as interactions between sterol-biosynthesis-inhibiting (SBI) fungicides and insecticide/acaricide. The mechanisms behind such synergistic effects of binary mixtures in bees are known to involve direct cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition, resulting in an increase in internal dose and toxicity of the binary mixture. Moreover, bees are known to have the lowest number of CYP copies and other detoxification enzymes in the insect kingdom. In the light of these findings, occurrence of these binary mixtures in relevant crops (frequency and concentrations) would need to be investigated. Addressing this exposure dimension remains critical to characterise the likelihood and plausibility of such interactions to occur under field realistic conditions. Finally, data gaps and further work for the development of risk assessment methods to assess multiple stressors in bees including chemicals and non-chemical stressors in bees are discussed.},

	abstract = {Chronic pain is a significant cause of morbidity and disability globally. One potential strategy for the self-management of chronic pain is interacting with companion animals; more specifically, dogs. While studies of dog ownership suggest social, psychological, and health benefits to humans, the impact on chronic pain is unclear. The aim of this scoping review was to map the literature on dog ownership and wellbeing in people with chronic pain. This review followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) reporting guidelines. Twelve electronic databases and grey literature sources were searched for studies that included adults with chronic pain living with a dog. From 6,724 records, eight studies were included in the synthesis, including six cross-sectional survey studies and two qualitative studies. Studies specifically looking at pain provided mixed results, but people living with a dog reported better mental health. The health benefits related to social support for people living with a dog were reported as positive across several studies. Low-quality studies and variability in outcome measures limited comparisons across studies. The results of these eight studies suggest that the relationship between dog ownership and chronic pain is inconclusive and complex. Living with a dog for people who have chronic pain appears to provide positive benefits for some populations. Six studies were published after 2013 suggesting this important area of enquiry may be emerging as a new field in the study of the human- animal bond. Further research using qualitative, mixed methods, and longitudinal designs are needed to understand the potential mechanisms involved.},

This systematic review aimed to analyse and summarize the current knowledge of gene expression responses to infectious diseases in teleosts using viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites as agents through published microarray data. We conducted searches in electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science and SCOPUS until 1 May 2019. We identified 862 citations across databases and manual searches. After removing duplicates, we screened 455 unique references using titles and abstracts, of which 262 proved potentially eligible and evaluated using full text. A total of 79 articles proved eligible for this review. From the articles retrieved, we examined 261 different experiments (or 'studies') and more than a hundred thousand differentially expressed genes (DEGs). This systematic review represents the first catalogue of genes (and their associated processes) that differentially transcribe in different teleost species (13 species) due to infections generated by a large variety of pathogens (38 types). Although the obtained gene expression results are in considerable measure associated with expected immune response, other genes showed surprising significant transcriptional outcomes that may unravel unknown functions related to fish infections. This type of investigations facilitates the visualization of existing gaps in researches that may inspire future analysis in non-traditional but relevant host or pathogen species.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arthritis is a syndrome associated with exacerbated inflammation, joint destruction and chronic pain and disability. Chronic treatment of arthritis is associated with several side effects and high abandonment. Therefore, there has been an ongoing search for alternative treatments to overcome these problems. PURPOSE: Natural products, which are already widely used for their biological, cosmetic and pharmacotechnic properties, are a possible source for new drugs. Terpenes, a large class of organic compounds produced mainly by plants and trees, are a promising natural product and have already been shown to be effective in treating chronic pain, particularly of an inflammatory origin. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This review identifies the main terpenes with anti-arthritic activity reported in the last 10 years. A survey was conducted between December 2017 and June 2018 in the PUBMED, SCOPUS and Science Direct databases using combinations of the descriptors terpenes, arthritis and inflammation. RESULTS: The results showed that terpenes have promising biological effects in relation to the treatment of arthritis, with the 24 terpenes identified in our survey being effective in the modulation of inflammatory mediators important to the physiopathology of arthritis, such as IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α, NFκB, and COX-2, among others. It is important to note that most of the studies used animal models, which limits, at least in part, the direct translation to humans of the experimental evidence produced by the studies. CONCLUSION: Together, our finds suggest that terpenes can modulate the immuno-regulatory and destructive tissue events that underlie the clinical presentation and the progression of arthritis and are worthy of further clinical investigation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unconventional perfusion flaps offer multiple potential advantages compared with traditional flaps. Although there are numerous experimental articles on unconventional perfusion flaps, the multiple animal species involved, the myriad vascular constructions used, and the frequently conflicting data reported make synthesis of this information challenging. The main aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on the experimental use of unconventional perfusion flaps, to identify the best experimental models proposed and to estimate their global survival rate. METHODS: The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all articles written in English, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese on the experimental use of unconventional perfusion flaps and indexed to PubMed from 1981 until February 1, 2017. RESULTS: A total of 68 studies were found, corresponding to 86 optimized experimental models and 1073 unconventional perfusion flaps. The overall unconventional perfusion flap survival rate was 90.8 percent (95 percent CI, 86.9 to 93.6 percent; p {\textless} 0.001). The estimated proportion of experimental unconventional perfusion flaps presenting complete survival or nearly complete survival was 74.4 percent (95 percent CI, 62.1 to 83.7 percent; p {\textless} 0.001). The most commonly reported animal species in the literature were the rabbit (57.1 percent), the rat (26.4 percent), and the dog (14.3 percent). No significant differences were found in survival rates among these species, or among the diverse vascular patterns used. CONCLUSION: These data do not differ significantly from those reported regarding the use of unconventional perfusion flaps in human medicine, suggesting that rabbit, rat, and canine experimental unconventional perfusion flap models may adequately mimic the clinical application of unconventional perfusion flaps.},

A scoping review was undertaken with an electronic search for articles from the Ovid MEDLINE, PUBMED and EMBASE databases from 1995 to 2017. Inclusion criteria were original research articles, and reviews including both animal models and human clinical studies of acute ({\textless} 3 months) sTBI. Selected articles included both isolated sTBI and sTBI with systemic injury. After applying the inclusion criteria and removing duplicates, 141 full-text articles, 126 original research articles and 15 review articles, were evaluated in compiling this review paper. A single reviewer, CC, completed the review in two phases. During the first phase, titles and abstracts of selected articles were reviewed for inclusion. A second evaluation was then conducted on the full text of all selected articles to ensure relevancy. From our current understanding of the literature, it is unlikely a single biomarker will be sufficient in accurately prognosticating patients with sTBI. Intuitively, a more severe injury will demonstrate higher levels of inflammatory cytokines which may correlate as a marker of severe injury. This does not mean, necessarily, these cytokines have a direct and causal role in the poor outcome of the patient. Further research is required to better delineate the complex systemic inflammatory and CNS interactions that occur during sTBI before they can be applied as a reliable prognostic tool.},

We explored evidence from animal models of knee OA by preforming a systematic review of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for original articles reporting subchondral bone and cartilage pathology in animal models with epiphyseal closure. Extracted data included: method of induction; animal model; cartilage and bone assessment and method; meniscal assessment; skeletal maturity; controls; and time points assessed. Quality scoring was performed. The best evidence was synthesized from high-quality skeletally mature models, without direct trauma to tissues of interest and with multiple time points. Altogether, 2849 abstracts were reviewed. Forty-seven papers were included reporting eight different methods of inducing OA, six different species, six different methods of assessing cartilage, five different bone structural parameters, and four assessed meniscus as a potential initiator. Overall, the simultaneous onset of OA in cartilage and bone was reported in 82\% of datasets, 16\% reported bone onset, and 2\% reported cartilage onset. No dataset containing meniscal data reported meniscal onset. However, using the best evidence synthesis (n = 8), five reported simultaneous onset when OA was induced, while three reported bone onset when OA occurred spontaneously; none reported cartilage onset. In summary, there is a paucity of well-designed studies in this area which makes the conclusions drawn conjectures rather than proven certainties. However, within the limitation of data quality, this review suggests that in animal models, the structural onset of knee OA occurs either in bone prior to cartilage pathology or simultaneously.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Although numerous studies have suggested that pharmacological alteration of the dopamine (DA) system modulates reward discounting, these studies have produced inconsistent findings. OBJECTIVES: Here, we conducted a systematic review and pre-registered meta-analysis to evaluate DA drug-mediated effects on reward discounting of time, probability, and effort costs in studies of healthy rats. This produced a total of 1343 articles to screen for inclusion/exclusion. From the literature, we identified 117 effects from approximately 1549 individual rats. METHODS: Using random effects with maximum-likelihood estimation, we meta-analyzed placebo-controlled drug effects for (1) DA D1-like receptor agonists and (2) antagonists, (3) D2-like agonists and (4) antagonists, and (5) DA transporter-modulating drugs. RESULTS: Meta-analytic effects showed that DAT-modulating drugs decreased reward discounting. While D1-like and D2-like antagonists both increased discounting, agonist drugs for those receptors had no significant effect on discounting behavior. A number of these effects appear contingent on study design features like cost type, rat strain, and microinfusion location. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a nuanced relationship between DA and discounting behavior and urge caution when drawing generalizations about the effects of pharmacologically manipulating dopamine on reward-based decision-making.},

	abstract = {The effect of dairy product consumption on health has received substantial attention in the last decade. However, a number of prospective cohort studies have shown contradictory results, which causes uncertainty about the effects of dairy products on health. We conducted an overview of existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses to examine the association between dairy product consumption and all-cause mortality risk. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Web of Science databases from their inception to April, 2018. We evaluated the risk of bias of each study included using the AMSTAR 2 tool. The risk ratios (RRs) for each meta-analysis were displayed in a forest plot for dose-response and for high compared with low dairy consumption. The initial search retrieved 2154 articles; a total of 8 meta-analyses were finally included after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The number of included studies in each meta-analysis ranged from 6 to 26 cohort studies, which reported data from 6-28 populations. The sample sizes varied across studies from 24,466 participants reporting 5092 mortality cases to 938,817 participants reporting 126,759 mortality cases. After assessing the risk of bias, 25\% of the studies were categorized as acceptable, 25\% as good, and 50\% as very good. The RRs reported by the meta-analyses ranged from 0.96 to 1.01 per 200 g/d of dairy product consumption (including total, high-fat, low-fat, and fermented dairy products), from 0.99 to 1.01 per 200-244 g/d of milk consumption, and from 0.99 to 1.03 per 10-50 g/d of cheese consumption. The RR per 50 g/d of yogurt consumption was 0.97 (95\% CI: 0.85, 1.11). In conclusion, dairy product consumption is not associated with risk of all-cause mortality.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To summarize currently available data regarding the use of bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) for the treatment of focal chondral lesions of the knee in experimental animal models and human clinical studies. METHODS: A systematic review searching for the terms "(bone marrow)" AND "(aspirate OR concentrate)" AND "(cartilage OR chondral OR osteochondral)" was performed in the databases PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar regarding the use of BMAC for the treatment of focal chondral lesions of the knee. The inclusion criteria were animal and clinical studies published in English that used autologous BMAC to treat focal chondral defects of the knee. We excluded studies that evaluated nonconcentrated preparations of bone marrow aspirate or preparations that were culture expanded. RESULTS: A total of 23 studies were included: 10 studies performed in animal models and 13 human clinical studies. Animal studies showed inconsistent outcomes regarding the efficacy of BMAC for the treatment of chondral or osteochondral lesions, assessed by gross morphology, second-look arthroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging, histology, immunohistochemistry, mechanical testing, and micro-tomography. Chondral defect filling was achieved with fibrocartilage or "hyaline-like" cartilage. Cells present in BMAC did not meet the criteria to be characterized as mesenchymal stem cells according to the International Society for Cell Therapy because freshly isolated cells failed to show tri-lineage differentiation. Overall, all clinical studies, independent of the study group or level of evidence, reported improved clinical outcomes and higher macroscopic, magnetic resonance imaging, and histology scores. Comparative trials favored BMAC over microfracture and reported equivalent outcomes between BMAC and matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation. However, clinical studies were scant and showed low scientific rigor, poor methodologic quality, and low levels of evidence on average. CONCLUSIONS: Although clinical success in short-term and midterm applications has been suggested for the application of BMAC for the restoration of cartilage defects in lesions of the knee, current study designs are generally of low scientific rigor. In addition, clinical applications of this technology in animal model investigations have shown inconsistent outcomes. Thus, clinicians should apply this technology cautiously. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, systematic review of Level II, III, and IV evidence studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tylosin is a commonly used in-feed antimicrobial and is approved in several countries to reduce the incidence of liver abscesses in beef cattle. Macrolides are critically important antimicrobials in human health and used to treat some foodborne bacterial diseases, such as Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella. Feeding tylosin could select for resistant enteric bacteria in cattle, which could contaminate beef products at slaughter and potentially cause foodborne illness. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of feeding tylosin to cattle on phenotypic and genotypic resistance in several potential zoonotic enteric bacteria: Enterococcus species, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica, and Campylobacter species. This review was registered with PROSPERO (\#CRD42018085949). RESULTS: Eleven databases were searched for primary research studies that fed tylosin at approved doses to feedlot cattle and tested bacteria of interest for phenotypic or genotypic resistance. We screened 1,626 citations and identified 13 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Enterococcus species were tested in seven studies, Escherichia coli was isolated in five studies, three studies reported on Salmonella, and two studies reported on Campylobacter species. Most studies relied on phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing and seven also reported resistance gene testing. A random-effects meta-analyses of erythromycin-resistant enterococci from four studies had significant residual heterogeneity. Only two studies were available for a meta-analysis of tylosin-resistant enterococci. A semi-quantitative analysis demonstrated an increase in macrolide-resistant enterococci after long durations of tylosin administration ({\textgreater}100 days). Semi-quantitative analyses of other bacteria-antimicrobial combinations revealed mixed results, but many comparisons found no effect of tylosin administration. However, about half of these no-effect comparisons did not record the cumulative days of tylosin administration or the time since the last dose. CONCLUSIONS: When fed at approved dosages for typical durations, tylosin increases the proportion of macrolide-resistant enterococci in the cattle gastrointestinal tract, which could pose a zoonotic risk to human beef consumers. Feeding tylosin for short durations may mitigate the impact on macrolide-resistant enterococci and further studies are encouraged to determine the effect of minimizing or eliminating tylosin use in beef cattle. There may also be an impact on other bacteria and other antimicrobial resistances but additional details or data are needed to strengthen these comparisons. We encourage authors of antimicrobial-resistance studies to follow reporting guidelines and publish details of all comparisons to strengthen future meta-analyses.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Parasitic infections are considered a major public health problem due to their associated morbimortality and negative impact on physical and intellectual development, especially in the at-risk pediatric group. Periodic prophylactic administration of antiparasitic agents against soil-transmitted helminths is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to control parasitic infections and disease burden. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in Brazil. METHODS: We performed a systematic review by searching the literature found in the PubMed, LILACS, and SciELO databases, followed by a meta-analysis of the proportions from studies published in English, Portuguese, and/or Spanish from January 2000 to May 2018. This systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42018096214). RESULTS: The prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections (protozoa and/or helminths) in Brazil was 46\% (confidence interval: 39-54\%), with 99\% heterogeneity. Prevalence varied by region: 37\%, 51\%, 50\%, 58\%, and 41\% in the Southeast, South, Northeast, North, and Central-West regions, respectively. Most studies (32/40) evaluated children ({\textless}18 years) and found an average prevalence of 51\%. Children also had the highest prevalence in all four regions: Central-West (65\%), South (65\%), North (58\%), Northeast (53\%), and Southeast (37\%). However, most studies evaluated specific populations, which may have created selection bias. Presumably, this review of intestinal parasitic diseases in Brazil includes the most studies and the largest population ever considered. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections is high in Brazil, and anthelmintic drugs should be administered periodically as a prophylactic measure, as recommended by the WHO.},

This study therefore reviewed existing literature with the aim of analyzing the current state of helminthiasis among North Koreans, as well as highlighting the difference in the prevalence of helminthiasis between North Korean residents and refugees. All published resources citing helminthiasis among North Koreans were screened through the PubMed and a Korean bibliographic database as of April 2019. Official papers reported by the government and international agencies, as well as reports and books published in North Korea, were reviewed. After removing duplicated government reports, a total of 37 records were screened, and four were determined to be included for review. The total number of study subjects was 621 from the four eligible studies. Forty percent of them were refugees living outside North Korea. Total positive rate of any kind of helminths was 37.7\%. Ascaris was the most widespread helminths with a prevalence estimate of 41.1\%. The total positive rate of helminthiasis among residents living in North Korea was significantly higher than that among North Korean refugees (47.2\% vs. 23.4\%, chi-square p-value {\textless} 0.001). Poor hygiene, malfunctioning public health infrastructure, and feculent agricultural practices accounted for the spread of helminthiasis. Appropriate strategies and policies should be developed to prevent and alleviate helminthiasis in North Korea.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the efficacy and safety profile of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in feline epilepsy is a crucial consideration for managing this important brain disease. However, there is a lack of information about the treatment of feline epilepsy and therefore a systematic review was constructed to assess current evidence for the AEDs' efficacy and tolerability in cats. The methods and materials of our former systematic reviews in canine epilepsy were mostly mirrored for the current systematic review in cats. Databases of PubMed, CAB Direct and Google scholar were searched to detect peer-reviewed studies reporting efficacy and/or adverse effects of AEDs in cats. The studies were assessed with regards to their quality of evidence, i.e. study design, study population, diagnostic criteria and overall risk of bias and the outcome measures reported, i.e. prevalence and 95\% confidence interval of the successful and affected population in each study and in total. RESULTS: Forty studies describing clinical outcomes of AEDs' efficacy and safety were included. Only two studies were classified as "blinded randomised controlled trials". The majority of the studies offered high overall risk of bias and described low feline populations with unclear diagnostic criteria and short treatment or follow-up periods. Individual AED assessments of efficacy and safety profile showed that phenobarbital might currently be considered as the first choice AED followed by levetiracetam and imepitoin. Only imepitoin's safety profile was supported by strong level of evidence. Imepitoin's efficacy as well as remaining AEDs' efficacy and safety profile were supported by weak level of evidence. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review reflects an evidence-based assessment of the published data on the AEDs' efficacy and safety for feline epilepsy. Currently, phenobarbital is likely to be the first-line for feline epileptic patients followed by levetiracetam and imepitoin. It is essential that clinicians evaluate both AEDs' effectiveness and tolerability before tailoring AED to the individual patient. Further studies in feline epilepsy treatment are by far crucial in order to establish definite guidelines for AEDs' efficacy and safety.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the results of controlled studies evaluating the effectiveness of animal-assisted therapy (AAT) in children. METHODS: Eleven databases were searched following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement recommendations, and references from included studies and previous reviews were examined. No date or language filters were applied. Only controlled study designs, including those using wait-list controls, that studied a specific condition or illness were included. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies that met the inclusion criteria were retrieved. Nine were conducted in children with autism spectrum disorders, 10 in cerebral palsy (CP), 2 in Down syndrome, 3 in pain, and 2 in other conditions. Qualitative synthesis showed a small but significant contribution of AAT to the management of these conditions. Meta-analysis showed a mean difference in improvement in the Gross Motor Function Measure-66 scale in children with CP of 1.61 (95\% confidence interval [CI] -2.00 to 5.23) and a mean difference for 5-point pain scales of -0.81 (95\% CI -1.32 to 0.30), both favoring AAT. CONCLUSION: Animal-assisted therapy may be useful as a complementary intervention in the management of children with CP and pain. Although results are in general positive for the management of children with Down syndrome and autism, the diversity of scales used to measure outcomes makes it difficult to establish true effectiveness. The application of simple corrective measures in the randomization process would greatly improve the quality of evidence. It is necessary to reach a consensus between AAT researchers regarding appropriate instruments to provide higher-quality evidence in further studies.},

Two sets of reviewers selected 565 studies from a total of 2819 titles and abstracts identified in Embase, MEDLINE, and Scopus (2005-18), and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and WHO (One Health data). Study quality was assessed in accordance with Cochrane recommendations. Previous antibiotic exposure, underlying disease, and invasive procedures were the risk factors with most supporting evidence identified from the 88 risk factors retrieved. The odds ratios of antibiotic resistance were primarily reported to be between 2 and 4 for these risk factors when compared with their respective controls or baseline risk groups. Food-related transmission from the animal reservoir and water-related transmission from the environmental reservoir were frequently quantified. Uniformly quantifying relationships between risk factors will help researchers to better understand the process by which antibiotic resistance arises in human infections.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2004, researchers reported that the number of nephrology clinical trials was low and that the reporting quality of such trials was suboptimal. Furthermore, the number or quality of preclinical kidney-related studies has not been systematically evaluated. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of randomized clinical trials published in 1966-2017 (listed in the Cochrane Library) and preclinical studies published in 1945-2017 (listed in PubMed). For reporting quality analysis, we evaluated the final main paper of 118 clinical trial reports and 135 preclinical studies published in leading journals in 1996, 2006, and 2016 on the basis of criteria from the widely used CONSORT and ARRIVE guidelines. RESULTS: The annual number of reports of clinical kidney-related trials more than doubled between 2004 and 2014 along with reports in other medical disciplines. Hypertension remains the dominant focus of study, but ongoing trials also center on CKD, ESRD, and AKI. The reporting quality analysis revealed improvements, but deficits in reporting of clinical trial design, mode of randomization, and intention-to-treat analysis remain. Annual numbers of kidney-related preclinical studies remained low between 1945 and 2017 compared with other disciplines. Reporting quality analysis of preclinical studies revealed substantial reporting deficits across all leading journals, with little improvement over the last 20 years, especially for group size calculations, defining primary versus secondary outcomes, and blinded analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Nephrology studies keep increasing in number but still lag behind other medical disciplines, and the quality of data reporting in kidney research can be further improved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We conducted a systematic review to investigate avian influenza outbreaks and to explore their distribution, upon avian influenza subtype, country, avian species and other relating details as no comprehensive epidemiological analysis of global avian influenza outbreaks from 2010 to 2016 exists. METHODS: Data was collated from four databases (Scopus, Web of Science Core Correlation, PubMed and SpringerLink electronic journal) and a global electronic reporting system (ProMED mail), using PRISMA and ORION systematic approaches. One hundred seventy three avian influenza virus outbreaks were identified and included in this review, alongside 198 ProMED mail reports. RESULTS: Our research identified that the majority of the reported outbreaks occurred in 2016 (22.2\%). These outbreaks were located in China (13.6\%) and referred to commercial poultry farms (56.1\%). The most common subtype reported in these outbreaks was H5N1 (38.2\%), while almost 82.5\% of the subtypes were highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. There were differences noticed between ProMED mail and the scientific literature screened. CONCLUSIONS: Avian influenza virus has been proved to be able to contaminate all types of avian species, including commercial poultry farms, wild birds, backyard domestic animals, live poultry, game birds and mixed poultry. The study focused on wet markets, slaughterhouses, wild habitats, zoos and natural parks, in both developed and developing countries. The impact of avian influenza virus seems disproportionate and could potentially burden the already existing disparities in the public health domain. Therefore, a collaboration between all the involved health sectors is considered to be more than necessary.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although fish consumption or omega-3 intake is associated with cardio- cerebrovascular disease including stroke, their correlation is still controversial. Therefore, this meta-analysis is to identify the relationship between the risk of stroke and fish consumption or omega-3 intake. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases as of May 2019. Multivariateadjusted risk ratios (RRs) with 95\% confidence interval (CI) for stroke in different level intake of fish or Longchain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC ω3-PUFAs) were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. A dose-response analysis was conducted with the 2-stage generalized least-squares trend program. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis identified a total of 17 prospective cohort studies including 14986 strokes events in 672711 individuals. Meta-analysis revealed that the higher fish consumption was significantly associated with lower risk of stroke (RR=0.871, 95\% CI: 0.779-0.975, p=0.016), especially with ischemic stroke (RR=0.808, 95\% CI: 0.696- 0.937, p=0.005). Meantime, the combined RR of total stroke was 0.859 (95\% CI: 0.769-0.959, p=0.007) for the highest versus lowest intake of LC ω3-PUFAs, and stratification analysis showed that higher LC ω3-PUFAs intake was associated with reduced stroke risk in women (RR=0.793, 95\% CI: 0.706-0.891, p=0.000) but not in men. In addition, the dose-response analysis showed fish consumption with 1000g per month and LC ω3-PUFAs intake with 0.5g per month was associated with 17.3\% (RR=0.927, 95\% CI: 0.83-0.98) and 14\% (RR=0.86, 95\% CI: 0.78-0.95) lower risk of stroke, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Both fish consumption and LC ω3-PUFAs intake were negatively associated with the risk of stroke, especially in women, which suggest that increased intake of fishery products and LC ω3-PUFAs may benefit primary prevention of stroke.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease caused by severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV). The seroprevalence of anti-SFTSV antibodies specific to SFTSV (IgG or IgM) has been investigated in different animal hosts in many epidemiological studies, but no systematic estimation of seroprevalence has yet been performed. Hence, this meta-analysis was conducted in order to obtain a more comprehensive result to clarify the prevalence of SFTSV in animals. METHODS: A search for all relevant articles was conducted in the major national and international electronic databases up to August 2018. Data on seroprevalence of SFTSV antibodies (IgM and IgG) were extracted as the primary outcome. The pooled seroprevalence rates and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) were determined. RESULTS: Overall, anti-SFTSV antibodies (IgG or IgM) were detected in 15 animal species. The pooled seroprevalence of anti-SFTSV antibodies was 45.70\% in goats and sheep, 36.70\% in cattle, 29.50\% in dogs, 9.60\% in chickens, 3.20\% in rodents, and 3.20\% in pigs. The seroprevalence of SFTSV in animals that had a confined range was significantly lower than that in free-range animals. SFTSV RNA was detected in 11 animal species, with a carriage rate varying from 0.23\% to 26.31\%. CONCLUSIONS: SFTSV has a wide spectrum of animal hosts, including domestic and wild animals. The prevalence of SFTSV is high among specific animal species.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an increasing public health concern worldwide. The objective of this study was to calculate a summary odds ratio (OR) of livestock-associated MRSA colonisation and infection in humans, and to determine specific risk factors in livestock production contributing to MRSA colonisation. METHODS: We screened PubMed and Embase for studies published from 2005 to 2019 inclusive, reporting livestock-associated (LA)-MRSA colonisation and infection among livestock workers/veterinarians, their families, and community members not regularly exposed to livestock. The primary outcome of interest was the OR of LA-MRSA colonisation comparing exposed and control groups. Quality was assessed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. A meta-analysis using a random-effects model was conducted to calculate a pooled OR. The heterogeneity in the meta-analysis was assessed using the I² method, and publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots. RESULTS: A total of 3490 studies were identified by the search, with 37 studies including 53 matched exposed-control groups and 14 038 participants eligible for the meta-analysis. The pooled OR for LA-MRSA among livestock workers and veterinarians is 9.80 (95\% CI 6.89 to 13.95; p=0.000; I(2) =73.4), with no significant publication bias (Egger's p=0.66). The OR for swine workers was highest at 15.41 (95\% CI 9.24 to 25.69), followed by cattle workers (11.62, 95\% CI 4.60 to 29.36), veterinarians (7.63, 95\% CI 3.10 to 18.74), horse workers (7.45, 95\% CI 2.39 to 23.25), livestock workers (5.86, 95\% CI 1.14 to 30.16), poultry workers (5.70, 95\% CI 1.70 19.11), and industrial slaughterhouse workers (4.69, 95\% CI 1.10 to 20.0). CONCLUSIONS: Livestock workers, particularly swine farmers, are at significantly higher risk for LA-MRSA colonisation and subsequent infection. These results support the need for preventive practices to reduce LA-MRSA risk among those who handle and treat livestock. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42019120403.},

METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, SinoMed, and WanFang databases were searched from their inception date to September 2017, and an updated search was conducted in January 2018. Studies that evaluated the effects of WBV on bone healing compared with control groups in ovariectomized rats were included. Two authors selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality. Meta-analyses were performed when the same outcomes were reported in two or more studies. RESULTS: Nine eligible studies were selected. In treatment groups, callus areas were significantly improved in the first 3 weeks, normalized total bone volume and total tissue volume values increased dramatically at 8 weeks, and the mechanical tests showed a significant difference at the end point of the study. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that WBV could accelerate callus formation in the early phase of bone healing, promote callus mineralization and maturity in the later phase, and restore mechanical properties of bones.},

	abstract = {Stem cell transplantation has been considered a promising therapeutic approach for premature ovarian failure (POF). However, to date, no quantitative data analysis of stem cell therapy for POF has been performed. Therefore, the present study performed a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of stem cell transplantation in improving ovarian function in animal models of POF. In addition, a case report of a patient with POF subjected to stem cell treatment was included to demonstrate that stem cell therapy also contributes to the recovery of ovarian function in patients. Published studies were identified by a systematic review of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane's library databases, and references cited in associated reviews were also considered. Data regarding follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), ovarian weight, follicle count, the number of pregnancies and other parameters, including delivery route and cell type, were extracted. Pooled analysis, sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses and meta-regression were performed. In the case of POF, transvaginal ultrasound (TVS), abdominal ultrasound (TAS) and color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) were performed to observe the endometrial morphology and blood flow signals in the patient. Overall, pooled results from 16 pre-clinical studies demonstrated that stem cell-based therapy significantly improved FSH levels [standardized mean difference (SMD)=-1.330; 95\% confidence interval (CI), -(2.095-0.565); P=0.001], E2 levels (SMD=2.334; 95\% CI, 1.350-3.319; P{\textless}0.001), ovarian weight (SMD=1.310; 95\% CI, 0.157-2.463; P=0.026), follicle count (SMD=1.871; 95\% CI, 1.226-2.516; P{\textless}0.001), and the number of pregnancies (risk ratio=1.715, 95\% CI, 1.213-2.424; P=0.002). The results of TVS and TAS demonstrated improved ovarian size and endometrial thickness in the patient with POF after MSC treatment. Of note, a rich blood flow signal in the endometrium was observed on CDFI. It appeared that stem cell-based therapy may be an effective method for the resumption of ovarian function in a patient and in animal models of POF; however, large-scale and high-quality future studies are required to confirm the present findings due to heterogeneity.},

The pooled prevalence of AIVs was significantly higher in wild birds from Central China (5.5\%, 271/4, 955) compared to all other regions and the pooled prevalence of AIV antibodies was significantly in wild birds from South China (56.8\%, 92/162) in comparison to all other regions. The prevalence of both AIVs and AIV antibodies in Anseriformes were higher compared to non-Anseriformes. In addition, the largest number of studies found in this review were on the HA subtypes of AIVs (H5, H7, and H9) and their associated antibodies. In summary, our findings suggest that the prevalence of AIVs and their antibodies in wild birds vary among regions and species of wild bird. Thus, further monitoring of the prevalence of AIVs and their antibodies in wild birds in China is necessary and should be used for guiding powerful and effective regulatory measures that will prevent the spread of AIVs across species.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus poses a global public health threat given severe and fatal zoonotic infections since 1997 and ongoing A(H5N1) virus circulation among poultry in several countries. A comprehensive assessment of the seroprevalence of A(H5N1) virus antibodies remains a gap and limits understanding of the true risk of A(H5N1) virus infection. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published serosurveys to assess the risk of subclinical and clinically mild A(H5N1) virus infections. We assessed A(H5N1) virus antibody titers and changes in titers among populations with variable exposures to different A(H5N1) viruses. RESULTS: Across studies using the World Health Organization-recommended seropositive definition, the point estimates of the seroprevalence of A(H5N1) virus-specific antibodies were higher in poultry-exposed populations (range 0-0.6\%) and persons exposed to both human A(H5N1) cases and infected birds (range 0.4-1.8\%) than in close contacts of A(H5N1) cases or the general population (none to very low frequencies). Seroprevalence was higher in persons exposed to A(H5N1) clade 0 virus (1.9\%, range 0.7-3.2\%) than in participants exposed to other clades of A(H5N1) virus (range 0-0.5\%) (p {\textless} 0.05). Seroprevalence was higher in poultry-exposed populations (range 0-1.9\%) if such studies utilized antigenically similar A(H5N1) virus antigens in assays to A(H5N1) viruses circulating among poultry. CONCLUSIONS: These low seroprevalences suggest that subclinical and clinically mild human A(H5N1) virus infections are uncommon. Standardized serological survey and laboratory methods are needed to fully understand the extent and risk of human A(H5N1) virus infections.},

For assessing the prevalence of BHV-1 infection in mainland China, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched English and Chinese literature databases for published paper regarding the prevalence of BHV-1 in cattle in China from inception to May 20, 2018. Search strings included if they reported the cattle samples of more than 30 cattle and provided information that allowed us to establish the prevalence of BHV-1. Moreover, we excluded repeated studies, reviews, other hosts studies, as well as studies with inconsistent data, incomplete information or only provided prevalence data, and out of mainland China data. We extracted how many cattle have BHV-1 infection from the obtained studies, moreover, and calculated pooled prevalence of BHV-1 infection in cattle. The data of 41 articles (including data on 43,441 cattle) are compliant with the standards. The pooled prevalence of BHV-1 in cattle in China was 40\%, the pooled prevalence of BHV-1 in cattle from Northeast China (24\%) was significant lower than those from other regions. In addition, the prevalence of BHV-1 was associated with publication time of paper, detection methods, age of cattle, and clinical symptoms (pneumonia, abortion etc.).Our findings suggest that BHV-1 is common in cattle in mainland China. It is necessary to monitor the prevalence of BHV-1 in cattle and the powerful and effective regulatory measures should be taken out to prevent the spread of BHV-1.},

It is an acute and highly contagious enteric disease in swine characterized by watery diarrhea and vomiting. Here, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to assess the prevalence of PEDV infection in pig populations from mainland China. METHODS: We conducted a literature search on the prevalence of PEDV infection in pigs between Jan 1, 1988 and Aug 20, 2018 in English and Chinese databases, including PubMed, Google scholar, Cochrane library, Clinical Trials, VIP, CNKI and WanFang database. Selections were made based on the title and the abstract of paper, and duplicated literature was excluded along with other host studies, and data incomplete literature according to the exclusion criteria we formulated. Finally, we extracted the number of swine with PEDV infection from the obtained studies and provided information that permitted us to estimate the prevalence of PEDV infection in pigs in mainland China. RESULTS: A total of 45 studies (including data from 15,990 pigs) met our evaluation criteria. In China, the overall estimated prevalence of PEDV infection in pigs was 44\% (7113/15,990), while the estimated prevalence of PEDV infection in pigs from northern China was 37\% (793/2136), lower than those in other regions of China. The prevalence of PEDV infection was associated with sampling season, category of pigs and clinical signs (diarrhea) in pigs. However, the prevalence of PEDV among pigs in China was not significantly associated with the effect of detected target genes, nor was it associated with date of study publication. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that PEDV infection is common among pigs in China. It is therefore necessary to carry out further research and monitor the prevalence of PEDV infection. Furthermore, powerful and effective regulatory measures should be taken in order to prevent the transmission and spread of PEDV among pig populations.},

METHODS: The relevant animal experiments of EA treatment for hyperlipidemia combined with atherosclerosis were retrieved from the CNKI, WANFANG, VIP, CBM, PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library up to March 19, 2018 since the establishment of databases. Two researchers in the project team screened the literature and extracted the information such as experiment objects, experiment steps and experiment results separately. The literature assessment was evaluated. Meta analysis was performed with RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: Eventually, 29 eligible experimental researches were included and the average score in the quality assessment was 5.1, at the moderate level. Meta analysis showed that compared with the model control group, after EA treatment, the levels of the total cholesterol (TC) [SMD -2.29, 95\% CI (-2.94, -1.64), P{\textless}0.000 01], triglyceride (TG) [SMD -1.30, 95\% CI (-1.76, -0.84), P{\textless}0.000 01] and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) [SMD -2.64, 95\% CI (-3.29, -1.99), P{\textless}0.000 01] were significantly reduced and the level of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) [SMD 0.55, 95\% CI (0.06, 1.04), P =0.03] was increased, indicating the significant differences. CONCLUSION: On the base of the current limited evidences, EA significantly reduces the levels of TC, TG and LDL-C and slightly increases the level of HDL-C in the animal models of hyperlipidemia combined with atherosclerosis.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonotic pathogen that has spread worldwide. The HEV reservoir associated with livestock hepatitis E poses a huge threat to public health. Awareness of the prevalence and spatial distribution of livestock hepatitis E is valuable to prevent and control diseases caused by HEV, especially human hepatitis E infection. Currently, swine, including pigs (Sus scrofa), are recognized as the major reservoir of HEV. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the pooled prevalence of HEV among swine in China. A total of 71 published papers on HEV infection in swine in China (including data from 49,523 animals) from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019 met the standard after searching five databases including the Technology Periodical Database, the Wan Fang Database, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, PubMed, and ScienceDirect. A random effects model was used to calculate the pooled prevalence of HEV in swine. The results showed that the seroprevalence was 48.0\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 39.6-56.9) and the prevalence of HEV RNA was 14.4\% (95\% CI 10.7-18.5). The estimated overall prevalence was 34.1\% (95\% CI 27.2-41.4). Central China (68.0\%, 95\% CI 42.2-89.1) had a significantly higher prevalence than other regions. In the publication year subgroup, the prevalence in 2016 or later (27.2\%, 95\% CI 19.3-36.0) was significantly lower than that in 2011 or earlier (49.0\%, 95\% CI 36.2-61.8). The prevalence of IgG (42.9\%, 95\% CI 31.7-54.6) was significantly higher than that of IgM (4.9\%, 95\% CI 1.6-9.7). Suckling piglets (15.6\%, 95\% CI 6.6-27.1) had a lower prevalence compared with that in other age groups. In all sample types, body fluids showed the highest prevalence (50.5\%, 95\% CI 41.7-59.3). Moreover, the pooled prevalence of HEV in boars was higher than that in sows (35.4\% {\textgreater} 17.3\%). The analysis suggested that HEV infection is common among swine in China. Further strengthening HEV testing in boars, controlling environmental pollution, and reducing the mixed feeding of different stages could contribute to reducing HEV infection in pigs in China and the risk of porcine HEV infection in humans.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Photosensitisation is a clinical condition occurring in both humans and animals that causes significant injury to affected individuals. In livestock, outbreaks of photosensitisation caused by ingestion of toxic plants are relatively common and can be associated with significant economic loss. OBJECTIVES: The agents that are most commonly implicated in outbreaks of photosensitisation have not been formally investigated on a global scale. To address this question, a systematic review of the literature was undertaken to determine the most common causative agents implicated in outbreaks of photosensitisation in livestock in Australia and globally, as well as the prevalence and morbidity of such outbreaks. METHODS: A systematic database search was conducted to identify peer-reviewed case reports of photosensitisation in livestock published worldwide between 1900 and April 2018. Only case reports with a full abstract in English were included. Non peer-reviewed reports from Australia were also investigated. Case reports were then sorted by plant and animal species, type of photosensitisation by diagnosis, location, morbidity and mortality rate and tabulated for further analysis. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-six reports qualified for inclusion in this study. Outbreaks were reported in 20 countries. Australia (20), Brazil (20) and the United States (11) showed the highest number of peer-reviewed photosensitisation case reports from this analysis. Hepatogenous (Type III) photosensitisation was the most frequently reported diagnosis (68.5\%) and resulted in higher morbidity. Panicum spp., Brachiaria spp. and Tribulus terrestris were identified as the most common causes of hepatogenous photosensitisation globally. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatogenous photosensitisation in livestock represents a significant risk to livestock production, particularly in Australia, Brazil, and the United States. Management of toxic pastures and common pasture weeds may reduce the economic impact of photosensitisation both at a national and global level.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Peripheral blood (PB) is a potential source of chondrogenic progenitor cells that can be used for cartilage repair and regeneration. However, the cell types, isolation and implantation methods, seeding dosage, ultimate therapeutic effect, and in vivo safety remain unclear. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and the Web of Science databases were systematically searched for relevant reports published from January 1990 to December 2019. Original articles that used PB as a source of stem cells to repair cartilage in vivo were selected for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies were included. Eight human studies used autologous nonculture-expanded PB-derived stem cells (PBSCs) as seed cells with the blood cell separation isolation method, and 10 animal studies used autologous, allogenic or xenogeneic culture-expanded PB-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PB-MSCs), or nonculture-expanded PBSCs as seed cells. Four human and three animal studies surgically implanted cells, while the remaining studies implanted cells by single or repeated intra-articular injections. 121 of 130 patients (in 8 human clinical studies), and 230 of 278 animals (in 6 veterinary clinical studies) using PBSCs for cartilage repair achieved significant clinical improvement. All reviewed articles indicated that using PB as a source of seed cells enhances cartilage repair in vivo without serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: Autologous nonculture-expanded PBSCs are currently the most commonly used cells among all stem cell types derived from PB. Allogeneic, autologous, and xenogeneic PB-MSCs are more widely used in animal studies and are potential seed cell types for future applications. Improving the mobilization and purification technology, and shortening the culture cycle of culture-expanded PB-MSCs will obviously promote the researchers' interest. The use of PBSCs for cartilage repair and regeneration in vivo are safe. PBSCs considerably warrant further investigations due to their superiority and safety in clinical settings and positive effects despite limited evidence in humans.},

	abstract = {Dragon fruit (Hylocereus) and cactus pear (Opuntia) are cacti species that have been widely used globally as a reliable source of food as well as traditional folk remedies. They have become of scientific interest recently due to their high levels of bioactive phytochemical compounds, in particular betalains. Earlier systematic reviews have explored the impact of supplementation of these cactus species on obesity, type-2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular risk factors: body weight and composition, serum triglycerides, cholesterol, blood glucose and blood pressure. However, effects on vascular health and endothelial function have yet to be reviewed. In order to address this gap in the literature, a systematic review has been conducted to evaluate the physiological effects of Hylocereus and Opuntia cacti on endothelial and vascular function in in vivo animal models and human studies. An electronic search was performed in the following databases: PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE (via Ovid), CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science®, and The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL). All journals were searched since inceptions up to January 2020 without language restriction. Outcomes of interest were blood pressure, arterial stiffness, vascular reactivity and biochemical markers of endothelial dysfunction. Two investigators independently performed the study selection and data extraction. From 394 references, only 16 studies (9 animal and 7 human) fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Animal studies suggested a potential increase in vasodilation and serum nitric oxide and a reduction in vascular stiffness and blood pressure. The small number of human studies showed a reduction in heart rate as well as an increase in heart rate variability. Although these findings appear to indicate improvement in vascular health, there is a severe lack of robust, randomised human intervention studies to identify underlying mechanisms, optimal dose and long-term effects of cacti consumption.},

Then, we extracted more information about the aim of the study, the country, samples size, time of lactation, mercury concentration, and other data. Most of the studies used mature milk or colostrum for analysis and in about 60\% of them, the concentrations exceed significantly the limit set by the World Health Organization (WHO) of 1.7 micro g/l; In addition, many factors and parameters were related to the level of mercury contamination in breast milk. Periodic monitoring surveys are recommended in each country to evaluate the level of mercury in milk of lactating women and to estimate the level of exposure of newborns.},

The aim of this review was to estimate the status of urinary schistosomiasis in the State with regards to the elimination goals of World Health Organization (WHO). A comprehensive search of published articles on urinary schistosomiasis in Ebonyi State, Nigeria from 2006 to 2017 was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed and African Journals Online (AJOL) databases. Out of 26 retrieved articles, 15 met the inclusion criteria. The MetaXL software was used to compute the pooled prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis using the random effect model and results are presented as forest plot. Based on meta-analysis output, the pooled prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis was 26.02\% [95\% Confidence Interval (CI) = 17.91-35.04\%]. The pooled prevalence was higher before 2014, the year when treatment with praziquantel (PZQ) was started. Of the senatorial zones, Ebonyi North had the highest pooled prevalence of 34.57\% (95\% CI = 10.50-61.32\%). In addition, the prevalence of the disease was higher when all the age groups were sampled (31.33\%; 95\% CI = 12.75-51.98\%) than when only schoolchildren were used as sampling population (25.23\%; 95\% CI = 15.66-35.93\%). The pooled prevalence revealed that despite the mass drug distribution (MDA) of PZQ in the State, there is continued transmission of urinary schistosomiasis. Hence, if the WHO elimination goal of the disease has to be met, focused control and elimination programmes along with intense complementary public-health interventions are necessary.},

Dogs, therefore, pose a public health risk and a good understanding of canine diseases is important for planning and implementing control measures. The aim of this study was to characterise canine helminthiasis in sub-Saharan Africa using a systematic approach. METHODS: Pubmed and Google Scholar were searched for relevant primary studies published from 2000. Forty-one eligible studies were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled prevalences were estimated using the quality effects model. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-six genera of enteric helminths were reported and the pooled estimate of canine helminthiasis was 71\% (95\% CI: 63-79\%). Species of Ancylostoma and Toxocara, causative agents of larva migrans in humans, were the most frequently reported helminths with pooled estimated prevalences of 41\% (95\% CI: 32-50\%) and 22\% (95\% CI: 16-29\%), respectively. Dipylidium caninum and Taenia spp. were the most frequently reported cestodes with pooled estimated prevalences of 20\% (95\% CI: 12-29\%) and 9\% (95\% CI: 5-15\%), respectively. Trematodes were rarely reported. There was a high level of heterogeneity in most pooled estimates (I(2) ˃ 80\%). The results of this study show that canine helminthiasis is highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and there is need for regular deworming programmes to improve the health status of the dogs and minimise the potential health risk to humans.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tendinopathy is a common musculoskeletal condition affecting subjects regardless of their activity level. Multiple inflammatory molecules found in ex vivo samples of human tendons are related to the initiation or progression of tendinopathy. Their role in tendon healing is the subject of this review. SOURCES OF DATA: An extensive review of current literature was conducted using PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library using the term 'tendon', as well as some common terms of tendon conditions such as 'tendon injury OR (tendon damage) OR tendonitis OR tendinopathy OR (chronic tendonitis) OR tendinosis OR (chronic tendinopathy) OR enthesitis' AND 'healing' AND '(inflammation OR immune response)' as either key words or MeSH terms. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: An environment characterized by a low level of chronic inflammation, together with increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, may influence the physiological tendon healing response after treatment. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Most studies on this topic exhibited limited scientific translational value because of their heterogeneity. The evidence associated with preclinical studies is limited. GROWING POINTS: The role of inflammation in tendon healing is still unclear, though it seems to affect the overall outcome. A thorough understanding of the biochemical mediators of healing and their pathway of pain could be used to target tendinopathy and possibly guide its management. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: We require further studies with improved designs to effectively evaluate the pathogenesis and progression of tendinopathy to identify cellular and molecular targets to improve outcomes.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jep.2020.112907},
	abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alopecia is a chronic condition that may cause emotional and psychological distress to patients, which may significantly impact a patient's quality of life. As conventional treatments have only a transient therapeutic effect and result in unwanted side effects, many patients have attempted to find therapeutic herbs or compounds that function as safer and more potent treatments for alopecia. Many such herbs have been used in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for centuries; however, there is a lack of information on the therapeutic mechanisms of herbs used for the treatment of alopecia. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this review was to perform a critical assessment of the methods and results of experimental studies related to alopecia and to provide the potential mechanisms of action of herbs and their constituent compounds used in the identified studies, in particular, in relation to the stages of the cell cycle. We hope to better guide the clinical application and scientific research of herbs for the treatment of alopecia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed experimental studies to determine the methods used and the mechanism of action of the herbs and constituent compounds. Databases, including Medline (via PubMed), EMBASE, OASIS, and RISS, were searched for the following keywords: "medicinal plants," "alopecia," "alopecia areata," "androgenetic alopecia," "animal experiment," and "in vitro study." We also assessed the risks of bias, toxicity, and taxonomy to determine the quality of information. RESULTS: C57BL/6 mice and human dermal papilla cells were the most commonly used models for in vivo and in vitro studies, respectively. Many herbs and their constituent compounds were used to treat alopecia by managing the hair cycle, keratinocyte proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, hormones, and inflammation. These compounds prolong the anagen phase, shorten the transition from the telogen to phase anagen, and inhibit premature catagen phase. CONCLUSIONS: This review has further elucidated the therapeutic mechanisms of herbs and their constituent compounds that are relevant to alopecia and discussed the effectiveness of using herbal treatments. There is a need to develop evidence regarding the quality control, taxonomy, and toxicology of these compounds. Such improvements will provide a better quality of evidence to ensure the efficacy and safety of herbs and compounds used for the treatment of alopecia.},

For comparison, a systematic review was also performed by searching PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science using the keywords 'rabies,' 'bat' and 'exposure.' There were three MBE events in Rhode Island between 2010 and 2016 in which groups of individuals were asleep during the potential exposure. As a result, RIDOH provided PEP to those involved in the event. In a systematic review of 12 published reports, a variety of settings were involved in MBEs: camping sites, a domestic flight, a neonatal intensive care unit and dormitories. The number of potential rabies exposures ranged from five to 1,429 people. PEP recommendations for assessed persons ranged from 0\% to 100\% across events (median 21\%). The variation in PEP recommendations following a MBE may be dependent on medical need, past precedent or preference. Federal guidance for MBE is needed to add clarity and to minimize the variability in PEP recommendations for such events in the future.},

Advances in regenerative medicine have now led to animal studies examining the possibility of restoring injured hair cells with mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) administration. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to collate the existing preclinical literature evaluating MSCs as a treatment for SNHL and quantify the effect of MSCs on functional hearing. Our protocol was published online on CAMARADES. Searches were conducted in four medical databases by two independent investigators. Twelve studies met inclusion and were evaluated for risk of bias using SYRCLE. Rodent models were commonly used (n = 8, 66\%), while auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were the most frequent measures assessing hearing loss. MSCs were derived from multiple tissue sources, including bone marrow, adipose tissue, and umbilical cord blood and the dose ranged from 4 × 10(3) to 1 × 10(7) cells. Treatment with MSCs resulted in an improvement in ABR and DPOAE (mean difference-15.22, + 9.10, respectively). Despite high heterogeneity and multiple "unclear" domains in the risk of bias, this review provides evidence that MSCs may have a beneficial effect in hearing function.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neurotrophins of the nerve growth factor family are soluble polypeptides that are best known for their role in nerve growth, survival and differentiation in the central nervous system. A growing body of literature shows that neurotrophins and their receptors are also expressed throughout the reproductive tract. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Neurotrophins are key regulatory proteins in reproductive physiology during development and throughout adult life. Of the neurotrophins, the literature describing the expression and function of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its high-affinity receptor, neurotrophin receptor kinase-2 (NTRK2), has been expanding rapidly. We therefore conducted a systematic inductive qualitative review of the literature to better define the role of the BDNF in the reproductive tract. We postulate that BDNF and NTRK2 are central regulatory proteins throughout the reproductive system. SEARCH METHODS: An electronic search of Medline (PubMed) and Web of Science for articles relating to BDNF and the reproductive system was carried out between January 2018 and February 2019. OUTCOMES: In the ovary, BDNF expression and levels have been linked with follicle organisation during ovarian development, follicle recruitment and growth and oocyte maturation. In the endometrium, BDNF is involved in cell proliferation and neurogenesis. In contrast, literature describing the role of BDNF in other reproductive tissues is sparse and BDNF-NTRK2 signalling in the male reproductive tract has been largely overlooked. Whilst estradiol appears to be the primary regulator of BDNF expression, we also identified reports describing binding sites for glucocorticoid and myocyte enhancer factor-2, a calcium-response element through activation of an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear transporter protein-4 (ARNT) response elements in promoter regions of the BDNF gene. Expression is also regulated by multiple microRNAs and post-translational processing of precursor proteins and intracellular shuttling. BDNF-NTRK2 signalling is modulated through tissue specific receptor expression of either the full-length or truncated NTRK2 receptor; however, the functional importance remains to be elucidated. Dysregulation of BDNF expression and circulating concentrations have been implicated in several reproductive disorders including premature ovarian failure, endometriosis, pre-eclampsia, intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) and several reproductive cancers. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: We conclude that BDNF and its receptors are key regulatory proteins central to gonadal development, ovarian regulation and uterine physiology, as well as embryo and placenta development. Furthermore, dysregulation of BDNF-NTRK2 in reproductive diseases suggests their potential role as candidate clinical markers of disease and potential therapeutic targets.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maternal nutrition during pregnancy has life-long consequences for offspring. However, the effects of maternal overnutrition and/ or obesity on fetal growth remain poorly understood, e.g., it is not clear why birthweight is increased in some obese pregnancies but not in others. Maternal obesity is frequently studied using rodents on high-fat diets, but effects on fetal growth are inconsistent. The purpose of this review is to identify factors that contribute to reduced or increased fetal growth in rodent models of maternal overnutrition. METHODS: We searched Web of Science and screened 2173 abstracts and 328 full texts for studies that fed mice or rats diets providing {\textasciitilde} 45\% or {\textasciitilde} 60\% calories from fat for 3 weeks or more prior to pregnancy. We identified 36 papers matching the search criteria that reported birthweight or fetal weight. RESULTS: Studies that fed 45\% fat diets to mice or 60\% fat diets to rats generally did not show effects on fetal growth. Feeding a 45\% fat diet to rats generally reduced birth and fetal weight. Feeding mice a 60\% fat diet for 4-9 weeks prior to pregnancy tended to increase in fetal growth, whereas feeding this diet for a longer period tended to reduce fetal growth. CONCLUSIONS: The high-fat diets used most often with rodents do not closely match Western diets and frequently reduce fetal growth, which is not a typical feature of obese human pregnancies. Adoption of standard protocols that more accurately mimic effects on fetal growth observed in obese human pregnancies will improve translational impact in this field.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Males and females may experience different effects of early-life adversity on life-long health. One hypothesis is that male foetuses invest more in foetal growth and relatively less in placental growth, and that this makes them susceptible to poor nutrition in utero, particularly if nutrition is reduced part-way through gestation. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to examine whether (1) food and/ or protein restriction in rats and mice has consistent sex-dependent effects, (2) sex-dependency differs between types of outcomes, and (3) males are more severely affected when restriction starts part-way through gestation. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Web of Science were searched to identify eligible studies. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Eligible studies described controlled experiments that restricted protein or food during gestation in rats or mice, examined physiological traits in offspring from manipulated pregnancies, and tested whether effects differed between males and females. RESULTS: Our search identified 292 articles, of which the full texts of 72 were assessed, and 65 were included for further synthesis. A majority (50) used Wistar or Sprague-Dawley rats and so these were the primary focus. Among studies in which maternal diet was restricted for the duration of gestation, no type of trait was consistently more severely affected in one particular sex, although blood pressure was generally increased in both sexes. Meta-analysis found no difference between sexes in the effect of protein restriction throughout gestation on blood pressure. Among studies restricting food in the latter half of gestation only, there were again few consistent sex-dependent effects, although three studies found blood pressure was increased in males only. Meta-analysis found that food restriction in the second half of gestation increased adult blood pressure in both sexes, with a significantly greater effect in males. Birthweight was consistently reduced in both sexes, a result confirmed by meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We found little support for the hypotheses that males are more affected by food and protein restriction, or that effects are particularly severe if nutrition is reduced part-way through gestation. However, less than half of the studies tested for sex by maternal diet interactions to identify sex-dependent effects. As a result, many reported sex-specific effects may be false positives.},

	abstract = {Orthosiphon stamineus (OS) or Orthosiphon aristatus var. aristatus (OAA) is commonly known as cat's whiskers or "misai kucing". It is an herbaceous shrub that is popular in many different traditional and complementary medicinal systems. Its popularity has been justified by the plethora of studies that have shown that the secondary metabolites of the plant has effects that range from anti-inflammatory and gastroprotective to anorexic and antihypertensive. As such, OS could also be a potential treatment for Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders. However, a cohesive synthesis of the protective actions of OS was lacking. This systematic review was therefore commenced to elaborate on the various protective mechanisms of OS in the CNS. The PRISMA model was used and five databases (Google Scholar, SCOPUS, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, and PubMed) were searched with relevant keywords to finally identify four articles that met the inclusion criteria. The articles described the protective effects of OS extracts on Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, learning and memory, oxidative stress, and neurotoxicity. All the articles found were experimental or preclinical studies on animal models or in vitro systems. The reported activities demonstrated that OS could be a potential neuroprotective agent and might improve CNS conditions like neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress.},

Contaminated ready-to-eat foods are common sources of L. monocytogenes, yet no global estimates exist for prevalence and levels in high-risk ready-to-eat foods. Our objective was to estimate the prevalence and levels of L. monocytogenes in deli meat, soft cheese, and packaged salad. We searched Medline, Web of Science, Agricola, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, Science.gov, ScienceResearch.com, and OpenGREY for studies on L. monocytogenes prevalence and/or levels, with no restriction on publication date. We used a priori study selection, data extraction, and risk of biases processes. Results were synthesized with random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions to evaluate heterogeneity between studies. We included in the review 100 studies with a sample size restriction of 100, and we estimated L. monocytogenes prevalence in deli meat at 2.9\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.3 to 3.6\%), in soft cheese at 2.4\% (95\% CI, 1.6 to 3.6\%), and in packaged salad at 2.0\% (95\% CI, 1.2 to 3.1\%). High heterogeneity was present in all food groups, and meta-regressions did not reveal consistent explanations for heterogeneity. Pathogen level was not reported consistently or in the format required for synthesis, so meta-analyses of this variable were not performed. The high heterogeneity between studies indicates that use of global summary prevalence estimates for risk assessments are not advisable, but awareness of risk and the heterogeneity of the risk is relevant for education and further risk assessment.},

There is a widespread belief that nonhuman primates evince only a weak capacity to use deictic cues; in contrast, domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) tend to demonstrate high success rates. This pattern of canid superiority has been taken to support the Domestication Hypothesis, which posits enhancing effects of artificial selection on the sociocognitive abilities of dogs and humans. Here we review nearly two decades of published findings, using variants of the OCT. We find systematic confounds with species classification in task-relevant preparation of the subjects, in the imposition of a barrier between reward and subject, and in the specific deictic cues used to indicate the location of hidden objects. Thus, the widespread belief that dogs outperform primates on OCTs is undermined by the systematic procedural differences in the assessments of these skills, differences that are confounded with taxonomic classification.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic arbovirus that causes severe disease in livestock and humans. The virus has caused recurrent outbreaks in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula since its discovery in 1931. This review sought to evaluate RVFV seroprevalence across the African continent in livestock, wildlife and humans in order to understand the spatio-temporal distribution of RVFV seroprevalence and to identify knowledge gaps and areas requiring further research. Risk factors associated with seropositivity were identified and study designs evaluated to understand the validity of their results. METHODOLOGY: The Preferred Reporting of Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to produce a protocol to systematically search for RVFV seroprevalence studies in PubMed and Web of Science databases. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement guided the evaluation of study design and analyses. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 174 RVFV seroprevalence studies in 126 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. RVFV seroprevalence was recorded in 31 African countries from 1968 to 2016 and varied by time, species and country. RVFV seroprevalence articles including either livestock and humans or livestock and wildlife seroprevalence records were limited in number (8/126). No articles considered wildlife, livestock and human seroprevalence concurrently, nor wildlife and humans alone. Many studies did not account for study design bias or the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests. CONCLUSIONS: Future research should focus on conducting seroprevalence studies at the wildlife, livestock and human interface to better understand the nature of cross-species transmission of RVFV. Reporting should be more transparent and biases accounted for in future seroprevalence research to understand the true burden of disease on the African continent.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by Coxiella burnetii. This bacterium survives harsh conditions and attaches to dust, suggesting environmental dispersal is a risk factor for outbreaks. Spatial epidemiology studies collating evidence on Q fever geographical contamination gradients are needed, as human cases without occupational exposure are increasing worldwide. METHODS: We used a systematic literature search to assess the role of distance from ruminant holdings as a risk factor for human Q fever outbreaks. We also collated evidence for other putative drivers of C. burnetii geographical dispersal. RESULTS: In all documented outbreaks, infective sheep or goats, not cattle, was the likely source. Evidence suggests a prominent role of airborne dispersal; Coxiella burnetii travels up to 18 km on gale force winds. In rural areas, highest infection risk occurs within 5 km of sources. Urban outbreaks generally occur over smaller distances, though evidence on attack rate gradients is limited. Wind speed / direction, spreading of animal products, and stocking density may all contribute to C. burnetii environmental gradients. CONCLUSIONS: Q fever environmental gradients depend on urbanization level, ruminant species, stocking density and wind speed. While more research is needed, evidence suggests that residential exclusion zones around holdings may be inadequate to contain this zoonotic disease, and should be species-specific.},

	volume = {14},
	issn = {1932-6203},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0220524},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most research into the health benefits of human-animal interaction has focused on species that interact physically with humans, such as dogs. This may be unsuitable for certain populations for reasons including accessibility and the risk of negative consequences to both the person and the animal. However, some research has associated viewing fish in aquariums with positive well-being outcomes; as there is no physical contact with the animal, this form of interaction carries less risk. At present, little is known about the specific benefits of human-fish interaction. OBJECTIVES: To explore current evidence relating to the psychological and physiological benefits of interacting with fish in aquariums. METHODS: Systematic searches were conducted to identify relevant primary research of any design. All forms of interaction were considered, including keeping fish as companion animals and fish aquarium-based interventions. "Non-live" alternatives, such as videos, were also considered. This review was conducted according to a registered protocol (PROSPERO ID: CRD42018090466). RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included. Two provided tentative evidence that keeping home aquaria is associated with relaxation. The remaining studies involved novel interactions with fish in home or public aquariums. Outcomes relating to anxiety, relaxation and/or physiological stress were commonly assessed; evidence was mixed with both positive and null findings. Preliminary support was found for effects on mood, pain, nutritional intake and body weight, but not loneliness. All studies had methodological issues and risk of bias was either high or unclear. CONCLUSIONS: Review findings suggest that interacting with fish in aquariums has the potential to benefit human well-being, although research on this topic is currently limited. Future research should aim to address gaps in the evidence, such as whether and how the type of human-fish interaction can influence well-being outcomes. Researchers should also aim to address the methodological concerns highlighted in this review.},

	abstract = {Daily rumination time (RT; min/d) is recognized as an important tool for assessing the health of dairy cows, which may depend on the disease, lactation stage and individual cows. Using a systematic review-meta-analysis, this study evaluated whether the variation in RT is effective for early detection of metritis and subclinical ketosis (SCK) in dairy cows in the pre and post-partum periods (from three weeks before to three weeks after calving). The research was carried out in four electronic databases - Scopus, Science Direct, Pubmed and Web of Science. The main inclusion criteria were original research; evaluation of RT in dairy cows; and use of RT for early identification of metritis and/or SCK in post-partum dairy cows. A random effect meta-analysis (MA) was conducted for each disease (metritis and SCK) separately, with the RT means of healthy and sick groups, measured in the pre and post-partum. The effect size used was the mean difference (MD).Twenty-two trials from six studies were included in the MA, involving 1494 dairy cows. For metritis, four trials from three studies in the pre-partum period were considered as well as five trials from four studies in the post-partum. For SCK, six trials from four studies pre-partum and seven trials from five studies in the post-partum period were taken into consideration. The heterogeneity between studies for metritis was null (I(2) = 0\%) and low (I(2) = 5.7 \%) in the pre-partum and in the post-partum, respectively. The MD of RT between healthy cows and those with metritis was different in the pre (MD =0.411 min/d; P {\textless} 0.001) and in the post-partum (MD =0.279 min/d; P {\textless} 0.001). In SCK, heterogeneity was high in the pre (I(2) = 69 \%) and in the post-partum (I(2) = 58.1 \%), and the MD of RT was similar between healthy and sick cows (P{\textgreater} 0.05). In a meta-regression, RT from primiparous cows showed a lower predicted value for MD (0.48 min. d; P {\textless} 0.05) compared to multiparous cows, and the increment in each unit of milk production decreased the predicted MD value by 0.08 min. d (P {\textless} 0.001). Our MA demonstrates that RT is a good predictor for early detection of metritis in pre and post-partum; however, it is not an adequate predictor for SCK. Further investigations using more frequent blood sampling and the same threshold values for BHB are required to assess the adequacy of rumination time to predict SCK.},

Population genetic studies have been increasingly applied to this end, mainly using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) data.ObjectivesThis review aimed to summarise approaches and findings of these studies and identify best practice lessons for this form of genomic epidemiology.MethodsWe systematically reviewed publications using MLST data to attribute human disease isolates to source. Publications were from January 2001, when this type of approach began. Searched databases included Scopus, Web of Science and PubMed. Information on samples and isolate datasets used, as well as MLST schemes and attribution algorithms employed, was obtained. Main findings were extracted, as well as any results' validation with subsequent correction for identified biases. Meta-analysis is not reported given high levels of heterogeneity.ResultsOf 2,109 studies retrieved worldwide, 25 were included, and poultry, specifically chickens, were identified as principal source of human infection. Ruminants (cattle or sheep) were consistently implicated in a substantial proportion of cases. Data sampling and analytical approaches varied, with five different attribution algorithms used. Validation such as self-attribution of isolates from known sources was reported in five publications. No publication reported adjustment for biases identified by validation.ConclusionsCommon gaps in validation and adjustment highlight opportunities to generate improved estimates in future genomic attribution studies. The consistency of chicken as the main source of human infection, across high income countries, and despite methodological variations, highlights the public health importance of this source.},

Riding a horse may lead to some benefits in chronic pain patients through the improvement of postural control and other biopsychosocial processes. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of horse riding (with real or simulated horses) on chronic pain. Materials and methods: A systematic literature search was carried out in accordance with PRISMA guidelines in Web of Science (WOS) and PubMed (Medline) electronic databases. Eleven articles (seven randomized controlled trials) were selected to be included in the review. Due to some risk of bias concerns, two meta-analyses (using postintervention or change-from-baseline measures) were conducted utilizing Review Manager Software (RevMan 5.3). Results: Horse-riding simulators significantly reduced the pain levels of patients with low back pain (p = 0.03, with a SMD of -1.14 and a 95\% CI from -2.16 to -0.11) using change-from-baseline measures. However, the p-value in the meta-analysis with the postintervention measures was 0.06. Regarding interventions with real horses, it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis due to the low number of studies. Conclusion: Horse riding could be a useful exercise to reduce pain, but more studies are needed to make evidence-based recommendations and to compare the effects of horse-riding with real and simulated horses.},

	abstract = {Current recommendations for the elimination of canine-mediated human rabies focus on mass dog vaccination as the most feasible and cost-effective strategy. However, attempts to control rabies are often combined with canine surgical sterilisation programmes. The added value of sterilisation is widely debated. A systematic review was undertaken to compare the outcomes and impact of vaccination and sterilisation programmes with vaccination only programmes. A systematic search of three electronic databases (CAB Abstracts, Medline and Global Health) and grey literature was performed. From 8696 abstracts found, 5554 unique studies were identified, and 16 studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight described vaccination only programmes and eight described vaccination and sterilisation programmes. Indicators of impact measured were dog bites and/or doses of post-exposure prophylaxis administered; numbers of dog and/or human rabies cases; dog population demographic changes; changes in health and welfare of dogs, and indicators related to human behaviour change. The studies were contextually very diverse, programmes being implemented were complex, and there was variation in measurement and reporting of key indicators. Therefore, it was difficult to compare the two types of intervention, and impossible to make an evaluation of the role of sterilisation, using this evidence. Given the large number of vaccination and sterilisation programmes conducted globally, the lack of studies available for review highlights a gap in data collection or reporting, essential for impact assessment. There are several knowledge gaps concerning the impact of the sterilisation component alone, as well as subsequent effects on rabies transmission and control. Prospective studies comparing the outcomes and impact of the two interventions would be required in order to establish any additional contribution of sterilisation, as well as the underlying mechanisms driving any changes. In the absence of such evidence, the priority for rabies control objectives should be implementation of mass vaccination, as currently recommended by the World Health Organisation.},

	abstract = {Interpreting the interplay between politics, social demographics and epidemiology is essential for understanding how a disease's occurrence and control evolve over time. Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus was first detected in Kenya in 1915 and serotyped in 1932. This review aims to describe and appraise initiatives to control FMD in Kenya since its independence from British rule in 1964, using information from the scientific literature. We describe the historical dynamics of FMD epidemiology in the country and determine socio-political factors that have shaped the control strategies used. PubMed, Scopus, CAB abstracts, Science Direct, Web of Science and Google Scholar were used to search and retrieve papers, using predetermined search criteria encompassing FMD, Kenya and disease control programme descriptors. In total 1234 papers were identified and screened for relevance using the World Health Organization's guidelines for rapid review. Ultimately 69 references from this search were included, and information extracted and consolidated. These papers highlight that following independence, there was a structured effort to control FMD consisting of a compulsory subsidised vaccination programme in the Rift Valley with movement controls and quarantine when outbreaks occurred. This programme led to an initial decrease in recorded FMD outbreaks. However, endemic circulation continued and this programme was discontinued due to multiple factors, including political deprioritisation and changes in the structure of veterinary services. Only low levels of active surveillance have been applied since 1964; most surveillance is passive and relies on outbreak reports. Currently control focuses on outbreak management and a mixture of public- and privately-funded vaccination. This review highlights critical drivers influencing disease control programme implementation including veterinary service structure, the active participation of stakeholders with farming systems and availability of affordable and matched FMD vaccine. Additionally, it appraises the availability of historical information and draws attention to gaps in the historical record.},

The purpose of this study is to systematically review the preclinical studies regarding sex differences in OA, with particular attention to the molecular aspect and gene expression, but also to the histopathological aspects. Three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge) were screened for eligible studies. In vitro and in vivo papers written in English, published in the last 11 years (2009-2020) were eligible. Participants were preclinical studies, including cell cultures and animal models of OA, evaluating sex differences. Independent extraction of articles and quality assessments were performed by two authors using predefined data fields and specific tools (Animals in Research Reporting In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guideline and Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) tool). Twenty-three studies were included in the review: 4 in vitro studies, 18 in vivo studies, and 1 both in vitro and in vivo study. From in vitro works, sex differences were found in the gene expression of inflammatory molecules, hormonal receptors, and in responsiveness to hormonal stimulation. In vivo research showed a great heterogeneity of animal models mainly focused on the histopathological aspects rather than on the analysis of sex-related molecular mechanisms. This review highlights that many gaps in knowledge still exist; improvementsin the selection and reporting of animal models, the use of advanced in vitro models, and multiomics analyses might contribute to developing a personalized gender-based medicine.},

Systematic sorting of the results allowed identification of consultation 'success factors' cited in peer-reviewed veterinary literature which were appraised using an appropriate critical appraisal tool (AXIS). Searches returned 11 330 results with a total of 17 publications meeting the inclusion criteria, of which four measured consultation success. Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association was the most common journal of publication (9 of 17) and the majority of included papers had been published since 2010 (12 of 17). Success factors measured were compliance, client satisfaction and veterinary surgeon satisfaction, and publications primarily used communication analysis tools to measure success.

Systematic search was carried out in three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) to include all studies, where stem cells were used as intervention for animal models for melanoma. Selected articles were classified according to SYRCLE's risk of bias tool for animals' studies. Experimental variables and published data for tumor incidence and growth were extracted from the eligible articles and standardized using Hedge's G for random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression. From 627 entries, 11 articles were eligible for meta-analysis. All studies tested the effects of a single injection of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) (from bone marrow or adipose tissue) admixed with B16 mouse melanoma cells (B16-F0 or B16-F10) or with human melanoma cells (A375 or M4Beu) in mice. Mean SYRCLE score was 3.09 out of 10. Results from random effects meta-analysis indicate that MSCs favored both tumor incidence and tumor growth (p = 0.001) in melanoma. Our results show that MSCs are protumorigenic in co-injection mice models for melanoma, increasing both tumor incidence and growth.},

	abstract = {Background: Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a mosquito-borne virus that is primarily found in North America and the Caribbean. Over the past decade there has been an increase in virus activity, including large outbreaks in human and horse populations. Predicted climate change is expected to affect the range of mosquitoes including vectors of EEEV, which may alter disease risk posing a public health concern. Methods: A scoping review (ScR) was conducted to identify and characterize the global evidence on EEEV. A thorough search was conducted in relevant bibliographic databases and government websites. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts for relevance and the characteristics of relevant articles were extracted using a uniformly implemented data collection form. The study protocol was developed a priori and described the methods and tools used and this article follows the PRISMA-ScR guidelines for reporting ScRs. Results: The ScR included 718 relevant research articles. The majority of the articles originated from North America (97\%) between 1933 and 2019. EEEV has been identified in 35 species of mosquitoes, over 200 species of birds, various domestic animals, wild mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. Articles identified in this ScR primarily covered three topic areas: epidemiology of hosts and vectors (344 articles) including surveillance results (138), pathogenesis of EEEV in hosts (193), and in vitro studies characterizing EEEV (111). Fewer articles evaluated the accuracy of diagnostic tests (63), the efficacy of mitigation strategies (62), transmission dynamics (56), treatment of EEEV in hosts (10), societal knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions (4), and economic burden (2). Conclusion: With the projected impact of climate change on mosquito populations, it is expected that the risk of EEEV could change resulting in higher disease burden or spread into previously unaffected areas. Future research efforts should focus on closing some of the important knowledge gaps identified in this ScR.},

	abstract = {Among the topics related to invasion science, the least studied are parasite co-introduction and spillback. This leads to an uncertainty in invasion ecology theories and applications to management. Therefore, the present study brings a systematic review of published information on the metazoan parasite fauna of Micropterus salmoides, a widely introduced fish, with the aim of comparing information about the composition and richness of the associated parasite communities in its native and introduced regions. This review demonstrates that there were twice as many studies of M. salmoides in its native region in comparison with introduced regions, although most of the studies focused on the analysis of a single species or taxon of parasite. This bias impacts the number of parasite species observed and, consequently, the apparent importance of enemy release in introduced regions. The composition of the parasite community in the two regions showed high similarity, which indicates the introduction and acquisition of parasites in introduced regions. Otherwise, there was no pattern related to the geographic distance, highlighting the influence of the propagule pressure and vector strength on the introduction of novel parasites. This illustrates the importance of vector strength on fish-parasite co-introduction and the necessity of new research examining host-parasite interactions with the parasite community of the invaded ecosystems. We still do not know the major influences of the composition of the parasite fauna of M. salmoides or how we can manage to develop a more restrictive vector pathway of introduction. The future of our ecosystems depends on how to account for current and future interactions among novel interactions, habitat, and climate change.},

The objective of this review was to examine the effect of grazing intensity in tropical pastures on the performance and productivity of beef cattle by a meta-analytical approach. The review followed a protocol developed and tested based on the PICOS strategy to formulate the guiding question: population (beef cattle), intervention (high grazing intensities), comparison (low grazing intensities), outcome (animal performance and productivity), and study design (experimental). Data were collected from papers published in the electronic databases of SCOPUS (Elsevier), Web of Science (Main collection), SpringerLink, Wiley Online Library, and Science Direct (Elsevier) by a single cross-reference search. The selected studies were considered relevant when they: (1) were primary research published in the format of a research article; (2) included grazing intensities as a management strategy; and (3) evaluated average daily gain (ADG, kg/animal per day), stocking rates (SR, animal unit (AU)/ha; AU = 450 kg), and weight gain per area (WGH, kg/ha). Thirteen manuscripts were selected due to their methodological strength for data extraction. The means under continuous stocking were 0.67 kg/animal per day for ADG, 518.12 kg/ha for WGH, and 4.19 AU/ha for SR. Under intermittent stocking, the means were 0.62 kg/animal per day for ADG, 980.18 kg/ha for WGH, and 5.10 AU/ha for SR. In tropical forages, the heights of 20 to 40 cm for pastures under continuous stocking and the defoliation intensities of 40 to 50\% for those under intermittent stocking result in greater individual performance and animal productivity per land area.},

METHODS: This review was performed at PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science databases using keywords as wound healing, thymol/carvacrol and essential oils. Thirteen studies were selected for discussion. KEY FINDINGS: Thymol/carvacrol was able to act in the three phases of wound healing. In the first phase, they showed modulatory effect of the inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and antimicrobial power. In the second phase, they promoted re-epithelialization, angiogenesis and development of granulation tissue. Finally, in the third phase, they improve the collagen deposition and modulated the growth of fibroblasts and keratinocytes. CONCLUSIONS: These compounds present a high potential for the development of new therapeutic for wound repair. However, dose, efficacy and safety of these compounds for the treatment of wounds, as well as the mechanisms by which those effects can be observed, are challenges for future studies.},

A broad assessment of experimental growth factors is important to inform future work and clinical potential in this area. To date, however, no study has systematically reviewed the investigational growth factors utilized in preclinical animal models of spinal fusion. AIM: To review all published studies assessing investigational growth factors for spinal fusion in animal models and identify promising agents for translation. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases with searches run on May 29(th), 2018. The search query was designed to include all non-human, preclinical animal models of spinal fusion reported in the literature without a timespan limit. Extracted data for each model included surgical approach, level of fusion, animal species and breed, animal age and sex, and any other relevant characteristics. The dosages/sizes of all implant materials, spinal fusion rates, and follow-up time points were recorded. The data were analyzed and the results reported in tables and text. PRISMA guidelines were followed for this systematic review. RESULTS: Twenty-six articles were included in this study, comprising 14 experimental growth factors: AB204 (n = 1); angiopoietin 1 (n = 1); calcitonin (n = 3); erythropoietin (n = 1); basic fibroblast growth factor (n = 1); growth differentiation factor 5 (n = 4), combined insulin-like growth factor 1 + transforming growth factor beta (n = 4); insulin (n = 1); NELL-1 (n = 5); noggin (n = 1); P-15 (n = 1); peptide B2A (n = 2); and secreted phosphoprotein 24 (n = 1). The fusion rates of the current gold standard treatment (autologous iliac crest bone graft, ICBG) and the leading clinically used growth factor (BMP-2) ranged widely in the included studies, from 0-100\% for ICBG and from 13\%-100\% for BMP-2. Among the identified growth factors, calcitonin, GDF-5, NELL-1, and P-15 resulted in fusion rates of 100\% in some cases. In addition, six growth factors - AB204, angiopoietin 1, GDF-5, insulin, NELL-1, and peptide B2A - resulted in significantly enhanced fusion rates compared to ICBG, BMP-2, or other internal control in some studies. Large heterogeneity in animal species, fusion method, and experimental groups and time points was observed across the included studies, limiting the direct comparison of the growth factors identified herein. CONCLUSION: Several promising investigational growth factors for spinal fusion have been identified herein; directly comparing the fusion efficacy and safety of these agents may inform clinical translation.},

	abstract = {Pseudarthrosis following spinal fusion is correlated with poorer patient outcomes and consequently is an area of continued interest within spinal research. Recently, bioactive glasses have been proposed as a means of augmenting fusion rates. Here, we present the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the existing preclinical and clinical literature on the effect of bioactive glasses on spinal fusion. Using the MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases, we queried all publications in the English-language literature examining the effect of bioactive glasses on spinal fusion. The primary endpoint was fusion rate at last follow-up and the secondary endpoint for clinical studies was the rate of deep wound infection. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed independently for the preclinical and clinical data. Twelve preclinical studies (267 animals) and 12 clinical studies (396 patients) evaluating a total of twelve unique bioactive glass formulations were included. Across clinical studies, fusion was seen in 84\% treated with bioactive glass. On sub-analysis, fusion rates were similar for standalone autograft (91.6\%) and bioactive glass-local autograft mixtures (89.6\%). Standalone bioactive glass substrates produced inferior fusion rates relative to autograft alone (33.6\% vs. 98.8\%; OR 0.01, p {\textless} 0.02). Rates of deep wound infection did not differ between the bioactive glass and autograft groups (3.1\%). The preclinical data similarly showed comparable rates of fusion between autograft and bioactive glass-treated animals. The available data suggest that bioactive glass-autograft mixtures confer similar rates of spinal fusion relative to standalone autograft without altering the risk of deep wound infection.},

	abstract = {The growing frequency of bluetongue virus (BTV) incursions in Europe in recent years led to the largest BTV outbreak ever recorded in 2006/09, with a dramatic impact on the cattle and sheep industries. The complex epidemiology of this vector-borne disease of ruminants and its recent emergence need to be better understood to identify and implement efficient control strategies. Mathematical models provide useful tools for that purpose; many of them have been developed in the light of the 2006/09 outbreak. We aimed to provide a systematic review of compartmental mathematical models dedicated to BTV occurrence or transmission in European countries, to assess robustness of findings to different modelling approaches and assumptions. We identified relevant papers from PubMed and Scopus databases, 21 of which were included in the review following the selection process laid out in the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. We systematically extracted data from these papers to address the diversity and evolution of modelling approaches, and to identify important characteristics for future model development. Then, we summarized the main insights provided into bluetongue epidemiology, and discussed the relevance of these models as tools for risk mapping and for the design of surveillance and control systems. On the whole, the mechanistic models reviewed provided flexible frameworks, yielding mostly epidemiological insights specific to geographical areas and study periods. Despite the limitations of these models that sometimes relied on strong assumptions, we advocate their use to facilitate and inform evidence-based decision-making in animal health.},

	abstract = {Despite over three decades of active research, musculoskeletal injuries (MSI) remain a global problem for the Thoroughbred (TB) racing industry. High-speed exercise history (HSEH) has been identified as an important risk factor for MSI. However, the nature of this relationship remains unclear, with an apparent protective effect of HSE against injury, before it becomes potentially harmful. Many MSI cases and fatalities occur during training rather than during racing, resulting in an underestimation of injury from studies focused on race day. The objective of this study was to examine the current evidence of the effect of combined training and racing HSEH on MSI in TB flat racehorses, through a systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic search of the relevant literature was performed using PubMedR, ScopusR, Web of ScienceR, and EmbaseR online databases and the gray literature using sites containing ".edu" or ".edu.au". Studies included in the review had explored seven different measures of HSE, including total career HSE distance, cumulative HSE distance in the 30 and 60 days before MSI, average HSE distance per day, per event and per 30 days, and the total number of HSE events. The total cumulative career HSE distance significantly affected the odds of MSI, with every 5-furlong increase, the odds of MSI increased by 2\% (OR = 1.02; 95\% CI 1.01, 1.03; p = 0.004). The average HSE distance per day also affected the odds of MSI, with every additional furlong increasing the odds of MSI by 73\% (OR = 1.73; 95\% CI 1.29, 2.31; p {\textless} 0.001). Other measures of HSE were not found to be consistently associated with risk of MSI, but these results should be interpreted with caution. Significant methodological limitations were identified and influence the comparability of studies. Standardizing the measures of HSE in studies of MSI, and describing training conditions in more detail, would support a more thorough investigation of the relationship between HSE and MSI. An improved understanding of this relationship is critical to mitigating the impact of MSI in the Thoroughbred racehorse.},

	abstract = {Sperm counts have shown a progressive decline across the world since the mid-1900s. Global rates of obesity have been climbing at a similarly alarming rate, suggesting that these two factors may be linked. However, studies examining the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and male fertility have produced conflicting results. These discrepancies among studies are commonly attributed to limitations that are inherent in human studies such as correlational data and confounding factors-limitations that are absent from animal studies. Hence, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of animal studies that experimentally induced obesity with a high-fat diet and measured impacts on sperm traits and/or male fertility. Overall, we found strong, consistent evidence in animal studies that high-fat diets are detrimental for male fertility. Compared with controls, males fed a high-fat diet had smaller testes and sex accessory glands relative to body size, reduced semen quality, reduced mating success, and reduced fertilization success. This is the first time that experimental data of high-fat diet effects on male reproduction have been synthesized in a meta-analysis, and thus, our results provide novel insight to the complex question of how dietary-induced obesity affects male fertility. The strong negative effects detected in animal models suggest that the inconsistent results plaguing human studies are an artefact of limitations inherent in correlational studies rather than a true effect.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is a widespread public health concern in the poorest regions of the world. The principal control strategy is regular praziquantel administration to school-aged children in endemic areas. With calls for the elimination of schistosomiasis as a public health problem, expanding praziquantel delivery to all community members has been advocated. This systematic review and meta-analysis compares the impact of community-wide and child-targeted praziquantel distribution on schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity in school-aged children. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science to identify papers that reported schistosome prevalence before and after praziquantel administration, either to children only or to all community members. Extracted data included Schistosoma species, drug administration strategy, number of treatment rounds, follow-up interval and prevalence and intensity before and after treatment. We used inverse variance weighted generalised linear models to examine the impact of mass versus targeted drug administration on prevalence reduction, and weighted boxplots to examine the impact on infection intensity reduction. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018095377. In total, 34 articles were eligible for systematic review and 28 for meta-analysis. Schistosoma mansoni was reported in 20 studies; Schistosoma haematobium in 19 studies, and Schistosoma japonicum in two studies. Results of generalised linear models showed no detectable difference between mass and targeted treatment strategies on prevalence reduction in school-aged children for S. mansoni (odds ratio 0.47, 95\%CI 0.13-1.68, p = 0.227) and S. haematobium (0.41, 95\%CI 0.06-3.03, p = 0.358). Box plots also showed no apparent differences in intensity reduction between the two treatment strategies. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this meta-analysis do not support the hypothesis that community-wide treatment is more effective than targeted treatment at reducing schistosomiasis infections in children. This may be due to the relatively small number of included studies, insufficient treatment coverage, persistent infection hotspots and unmeasured confounders. Further field-based studies comparing mass and targeted treatment are required.},

Titles and abstracts were searched according to the inclusion criteria and full texts were selected to be included in this systematic review. Data was extracted from each article and risk of bias was assessed for individual studies. RESULTS: Most studies reported that the treatment using a variety of stem cells resulted in significantly greater cementum regeneration. CONCLUSIONS: Because of variations in additional factors included in each study and varied risk of bias among those studies, the effect of each type of stem cell on cementum regeneration in dogs is difficult to clarify. Additional information needs to be obtained from each study in order to further analyze the individual effect of stem cells on cementum regeneration in dogs.},

In this context, the purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature to examine the effects of Col from different marine species in the process of skin tissue healing using experimental models of skin wound. The search was carried out according to the orientations of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA), and the descriptors of the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) were defined: "marine collagen," "spongin," "spongin," "skin," and "wound." A total of 42 articles were retrieved from the databases PubMed and Scopus. After the eligibility analyses, this review covers the different marine sources of Col reported in 10 different papers from the beginning of 2011 through the middle of 2019. The results were based mainly on histological analysis and it demonstrated that Col-based treatment resulted in a higher deposition of granulation tissue, stimulation of re-epitalization and neoangiogenesis and increased amount of Col of the wound, culminating in a more mature morphological aspect. In conclusion, this review demonstrates that marine Col from different species presented positive effects on the process of wound skin healing in experimental models used, demonstrating the huge potential of this biomaterial for tissue engineering proposals.},

We conducted a systematic review to investigate the effectiveness of dairy product intake for preventing cognitive decline, sarcopenia, and frailty in the elderly population. A systematic search for publications in electronic databases [MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, Scopus, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews] from 2009 to 2018 identified observational and interventional studies in English and Spanish that tested the relation between dairy product consumption and cognitive decline, sarcopenia, and frailty in community-dwelling older people. We assessed the participants, the type of exposure or intervention, the outcomes, and the quality of evidence. We screened a total of 661 records and included 6 studies (5 observational prospective cohort studies and 1 randomized controlled trial). Regarding cognitive impairment, the relation cannot be firmly established. Consumption of milk at midlife may be negatively associated with verbal memory performance. In older women, high intakes of dairy desserts and ice cream were associated with cognitive decline. On the other hand, 1 study demonstrated a significant inverse relation between dairy intake and development of Alzheimer disease among older Japanese subjects. The consumption of dairy products by older people may reduce the risk of frailty, especially with high consumption of low-fat milk and yogurt, and may also reduce the risk of sarcopenia by improving skeletal muscle mass through the addition of nutrient-rich dairy proteins (ricotta cheese) to the habitual diet. Despite the scarcity of evidence on the topic, our systematic review shows that there are some positive effects of dairy products on frailty and sarcopenia, whereas studies concerning cognitive decline have contradictory findings.},

	abstract = {Bees and the pollination services they deliver are beneficial to both food crop production, and for reproduction of many wild plant species. Bee decline has stimulated widespread interest in assessing hazards and risks to bees from the environment in which they live. While there is increasing knowledge on how the use of broad-spectrum insecticides in agricultural systems may impact bees, little is known about effects of other pesticides (or plant protection products; PPPs) such as herbicides and fungicides, which are used more widely than insecticides at a global scale. We adopted a systematic approach to review existing research on the potential impacts of fungicides and herbicides on bees, with the aim of identifying research approaches and determining knowledge gaps. While acknowledging that herbicide use can affect forage availability for bees, this review focussed on the potential impacts these compounds could have directly on bees themselves. We found that most studies have been carried out in Europe and the USA, and investigated effects on honeybees. Furthermore, certain effects, such as those on mortality, are well represented in the literature in comparison to others, such as sub-lethal effects. More studies have been carried out in the lab than in the field, and the impacts of oral exposure to herbicides and fungicides have been investigated more frequently than contact exposure. We suggest a number of areas for further research to improve the knowledge base on potential effects. This will allow better assessment of risks to bees from herbicides and fungicides, which is important to inform future management decisions around the sustainable use of PPPs.},

	abstract = {Antimicrobial use (AMU) in animal production is a key contributor to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) worldwide. As consumption of animal protein and associated animal production is forecast to increase markedly over coming years in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), accurate monitoring of AMU has become imperative. We summarized data from 89 scientific studies reporting AMU data in animal production published in English since 1998, identified through the 'ISI Web of Knowledge' search engine. The aims were as follows: (a) to describe methodologies and metrics used to quantify AMU; (b) to summarize qualitative (on-farm prevalence of use) and quantitative (amounts of antimicrobial active principle) data, in order to identify food animal species at the highest risk of AMU; and (c) to highlight data gaps from LMICs. Only 17/89 (19.1\%) studies were conducted in LMICs. Sixty (67.3\%) reported quantitative data use, with 'daily doses per animal-time' being the most common metric. AMU was greatest in chickens (138 doses/1000 animal-days [inter quartile range (IQR) 91.1-438.3]), followed by swine (40.2 [IQR 8.5-120.4]), and dairy cattle (10.0 [IQR 5.5-13.6]). However, per kg of meat produced, AMU was highest in swine, followed by chickens and cattle. Our review highlights a large deficit of data from LMICs, and provides a reference for comparison with further surveillance and research initiatives aiming to reduce AMU in animal production globally.},

	abstract = {We report a systematic review and meta-analysis of research using animal models of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). We systematically searched 5 online databases in September 2012 and updated the search in November 2015 using machine learning and text mining to reduce the screening for inclusion workload and improve accuracy. For each comparison, we calculated a standardised mean difference (SMD) effect size, and then combined effects in a random-effects meta-analysis. We assessed the impact of study design factors and reporting of measures to reduce risks of bias. We present power analyses for the most frequently reported behavioural tests; 337 publications were included. Most studies (84\%) used male animals only. The most frequently reported outcome measure was evoked limb withdrawal in response to mechanical monofilaments. There was modest reporting of measures to reduce risks of bias. The number of animals required to obtain 80\% power with a significance level of 0.05 varied substantially across behavioural tests. In this comprehensive summary of the use of animal models of CIPN, we have identified areas in which the value of preclinical CIPN studies might be increased. Using both sexes of animals in the modelling of CIPN, ensuring that outcome measures align with those most relevant in the clinic, and the animal's pain contextualised ethology will likely improve external validity. Measures to reduce risk of bias should be employed to increase the internal validity of studies. Different outcome measures have different statistical power, and this can refine our approaches in the modelling of CIPN.},

	abstract = {Acute abdominal pain (colic) is the most common reason for emergency veterinary treatment in the horse. Consolidation of data through a systematic review is important to inform evidence-based medicine and clinical guidelines, but there are currently no published systematic reviews on colic in the horse. The aim of this study was to identify, categorize and appraise the evidence on factors associated with increased risk of developing abdominal pain (colic) due to gastrointestinal disease in the adult horse. A scoping review was performed to identify and categorize evidence on all risk factors for colic. A systematic review of management-related risk factors was then performed following PRISMA guidelines. Both searches were conducted in Medline, CAB Abstracts and Web of Science databases, and publications were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria. For the scoping review, study and participant characteristics of included publications and key results were extracted and tabulated. For the systematic review, cohort, case-control or cross-sectional studies investigating acute abdominal pain in horses within two weeks of management changes were assessed. Study characteristics, participant characteristics and study results of included publications for the systematic review were extracted and tabulated. Included publications were appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools for cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies. The scoping review search identified 3,756 publications. Fifty eight studies met final inclusion criteria, and 22 categories of risk factors were identified. These were grouped into three broad areas: horse-related factors, management-related factors and environment-related factors. The largest body of evidence related to management change. The systematic review of management change identified 410 publications: 14 met inclusion criteria for analysis. These consisted of one cohort, eight case-control and five cross-sectional studies. The studies were conducted between 1990-2008, and the majority of studies were located in the USA (8/14) or UK (3/14). The risk factors related to management change that were assessed were feed, carer, exercise, pasture, water and housing. The largest bodies of evidence for increased risk of colic associated with management change were changes in feed (5/14 publications) and recent change in housing (3/14). Most studies (8/14) did not meet the JBI criterion on confounding factors. There was marked heterogeneity of study methodologies and measures. This is the first study to use a combined scoping and systematic review to analyse evidence for modifiable risk factors for a common condition in the horse. It provides a comprehensive review that will be a key resource for researchers, veterinary practitioners and horse owners. It identified modifiable risk factors associated with an increased risk of colic which should be a key target for preventative health programmes. The findings from the critical appraisal were used to develop recommendations for future research to improve the quality of evidence-based veterinary medicine.},

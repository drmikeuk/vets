	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to assess the heterogeneities of estimates and to estimate the seroprevalence of brucellosis in animals and humans in Ethiopia. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Data from 70 studies covering 75879 animals and 2223 humans were extracted. Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) and Complement Fixation Test (CFT) in series were the most frequently used serological tests. A random effects model was used to calculate pooled prevalence estimates. The overall True Prevalence of brucellosis seropositivity in goats and sheep were estimated at 5.3\% (95\%CI = 3.5, 7.5) and 2.7\% (95\%CI = 1.8, 3.4), respectively, and 2.9\% for each of camels and cattle. The prevalence was higher in post-pubertal than in pre-pubertal animals (OR = 3.1, 95\% CI = 2.6, 3.7) and in the pastoral than in the mixed crop-livestock production system (OR = 2.8, 95\%CI = 2.5, 3.2). The incidence rates of brucellosis in humans of pastoral and sedentary system origins were estimated at 160 and 28 per 100 000 person years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence of brucellosis is higher in goats than in other species. Its occurrence is evocative of its importance in the country in general and in the pastoral system in particular. Public awareness creation could reduce the transmission of Brucella spp. from animals to humans and the potential of livestock vaccination as a means of control of brucellosis needs to be assessed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The emergence and spread of drug resistant Salmonellae of both human and animal origins are global concerns and worrisome in countries where the risk of infection is high and treatment options are limited. The objective of this study was to estimate the proportions of animal isolates resistant to antimicrobials used against human salmonellosis in Ethiopia. METHODS: Published studies on the antimicrobial resistance features of Salmonellae isolated from food animals of Ethiopia were searched in Medline, Google Scholar and the lists of references of articles. Eligible studies were selected by using inclusion and exclusion criteria and data were extracted. The extracted data included the host species, the numbers of isolates and the numbers of ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, chloramphenicol, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin resistant isolates. The risks of bias were assessed and the percentages of the variations of the estimates attributable to heterogeneities were quantified. Pooled proportions were estimated by the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. RESULTS: Five hundred and fifty four Salmonellae isolated from cattle, camels, sheep, goats and pigs were tested with a variety of antimicrobials. The percentages of the variations attributable to heterogeneities were low for chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone (I(2) = 0) and high for ampicillin, co-trimoxazole and ciprofloxacin resistance estimates (I(2) {\textgreater} 75\%). The pooled estimate of ampicillin resistant isolates was higher in slaughtered ruminants (17.28\%) than in pigs (3.95\%), (p {\textless} 0.001). The pooled estimates of co-trimoxazole resistant isolates in true ruminants (4.35\%) and pigs (1.12\%) were not significantly different (p {\textgreater} 0.05). The overall pooled estimates of chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone resistant isolates were 2.24\% and 1.25\%, respectively. Seven serotypes have been reported to be resistant to antimicrobials uncommonly used in veterinary clinical practice in Ethiopia. CONCLUSIONS: Among Salmonellae of farm animals, there exist strains that are resistant to drugs used in the therapeutic management of human salmonellosis in Ethiopia. Intervention measures should be taken to ensure the prudent use of antimicrobials and curb the spread of high risk strains across the country.},

The source species significantly affected meat contamination in slaughter houses (P {\textless} 0.05) but not in the markets (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The pooled estimates of Salmonella contaminated goat carcasses, beef carcasses, minced beef and milk were 3.86\%, 4.53\%, 8.34\% and 10.76\% respectively.

S. Mishmarhaemek, S. Infantis and S. Hadar were the predominant isolates in cattle, small ruminants and pigs respectively. S. Typhimurium was isolated from all host species. Conclusions All food animals are considerable reservoirs of Salmonella and pose a significant risk to public health.

	abstract = {Background: Antibiotic use in human medicine, veterinary medicine, and agriculture has been linked to the rise of antibiotic resistance globally. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarise the effect that interventions to reduce antibiotic use in food-producing animals have on the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in animals and in humans. Methods: On July 14, 2016, we searched electronic databases (Agricola, AGRIS, BIOSIS Previews, CAB Abstracts, MEDLINE, Embase, Global Index Medicus, ProQuest Dissertations, Science Citation Index) and the grey literature. The search was updated on Jan 27, 2017. Inclusion criteria were original studies that reported on interventions to reduce antibiotic use in food-producing animals and compared presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria between intervention and comparator groups in animals or in human beings. We extracted data from included studies and did meta-analyses using random effects models. The main outcome assessed was the risk difference in the proportion of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Findings: A total of 181 studies met inclusion criteria. Of these, 179 (99\%) described antibiotic resistance outcomes in animals, and 81 (45\%) of these studies were included in the meta-analysis. 21 studies described antibiotic resistance outcomes in humans, and 13 (62\%) of these studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled absolute risk reduction of the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in animals with interventions that restricted antibiotic use commonly ranged between 10 and 15\% (total range 0-39), depending on the antibiotic class, sample type, and bacteria under assessment. Similarly, in the human studies, the pooled prevalence of antibiotic resistance reported was 24\% lower in the intervention groups compared with control groups, with a stronger association seen for humans with direct contact with food-producing animals. Interpretation: Interventions that restrict antibiotic use in food-producing animals are associated with a reduction in the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in these animals. A smaller body of evidence suggests a similar association in the studied human populations, particularly those with direct exposure to food-producing animals. The implications for the general human population are less clear, given the low number of studies. The overall findings have directly informed the development of WHO guidelines on the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals. Funding: World Health Organization.},

Design-Systematic review and meta-analysis. Sample-31 studies comprising 88 trials. Procedures-Studies that reported the effectiveness of commercially available bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and parainfluenza type 3 virus (PI3) vaccines for protection of cattle against BRDC or its components were included in the analysis. Studies or trials were categorized as natural exposure or experimental challenge and were further divided by the viral antigen evaluated and vaccine type (modified-live virus [MLV] or inactivated vaccine). Meta-analysis was performed; summary Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios were determined, and Forest plots were generated. Results-In natural exposure trials, beef calves vaccinated with various antigen combinations had a significantly lower BRDC morbidity risk than did nonvaccinated control calves. In trials evaluating BHV-1 and MLV BVDV vaccines in experimental challenge models, vaccinated calves had a lower BRDC morbidity risk than did control calves; however, in experimental challenge trials evaluating MLV BRSV and PI3 vaccines, no significant difference in morbidity or mortality risk was found between vaccinated and control calves. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Estimating clinical efficacy from results of experimental challenge studies requires caution because these models differ substantially from those involving natural exposure. The literature provides data but does not provide sufficiently strong evidence to guide definitive recommendations for determining which virus components are necessary to include in a vaccination program for prevention or mitigation of BRDC in cattle.},

	abstract = {The overall objective of this work was to develop empirical equations from a meta-analysis study to be used to implement initial values in a mechanistic heat balance model. The meta-analysis was conducted to 1) develop prediction equations for sweating and respiration rate (SR, g.m(-2).h(-1) and RR, breaths.min(-1), respectively) based on skin and body temperature (T(s) and T(b), degrees C, respectively) for different breed types: Bos indicus, Bos taurus, and their crossbreds, and 2) evaluate the fit of existing SR equations and the SR and RR equations (from objective 1) against independent data sets. Fourteen studies were collected for the SR analysis, 12 for fitting and 2 for evaluation. The fitted SR equations (Thompson model) for the 3 breeds types were B. indicus, SR = 0.085e(0.22.T(s)); B. taurus, SR = 0.75e(0.15.T(s)); and crossbreds, SR = 0.015e(0.25.T(s)). Twenty-three studies were collected for the RR analysis, 20 for fitting and 3 for evaluation. The fitted RR equations for the 3 breed types were B. indicus, RR = -1,660 + 43.8.T(b); B. taurus, RR = -1,385 + 37.T(b); and crossbreds, RR = -2,226 + 59.T(b). Three SR equations (Maia, McArthur, and Gatenby models) from the literature were evaluated against the Thompson model using the 14 studies. The McArthur model predicted SR within the correct range, but with an increased slope bias because the equation was linear and not the correct shape. The Maia model overpredicted SR for all breed types with the greatest overprediction being for crossbreds. The Gatenby model overpredicted SR for B. taurus (root mean square error of prediction = 506 g.m(-2).h(-1)), but was the best predictor for B. indicus. The Thompson model overpredicted SR for B. indicus (root mean square error of prediction ranged from 134 to 265 g.m(-2).h(-1)), but was the best predictor for B. taurus and crossbreds. The Thompson model was a good predictor for RR across all breed types. The meta-analysis showed that the Thompson model outperformed previous models for both RR and SR with the exception of the SR of B. indicus, which was best predicted by the Gatenby model.},

	abstract = {Digital dermatitis is a major problem in modern dairy production because of decreased animal welfare and financial losses. Individual cow treatments are often seen as too time consuming by farmers, and walk-through hoof baths have therefore been used extensively to control digital dermatitis. For decades, copper sulfate hoof baths have been used to treat and prevent digital dermatitis. Copper sulfate has been referred to as the industry gold standard when it comes to hoof-bath chemicals. In several scientific studies testing the efficacy of other hoof-care products, copper sulfate has been used as a positive control, thereby indicating that copper sulfate has a known positive effect. However, this may not be the case. A dilemma may exist between (1) copper sulfate generally being perceived as being effective against digital dermatitis and (2) a possible lack of well-documented scientific evidence of this effect. The objective of this study was to evaluate the existing scientific literature to determine whether the efficacy of copper sulfate used in hoof baths against digital dermatitis has in fact been demonstrated scientifically. A systematic literature search identified 7 peer-reviewed journal articles describing the efficacy of copper sulfate in hoof baths as treatment or prevention of bovine digital dermatitis. Only 2 of the 7 studies compared copper sulfate to a negative control; most studies were relatively small, and often no clear positive effect of copper sulfate was demonstrated. In conclusion, the frequent claim that copper sulfate is widely reported to be effective is supported by little scientific evidence. Well-designed clinical trials evaluating the effect of copper sulfate against digital dermatitis compared with a negative control are needed. Until such studies have been made, the efficacy of copper sulfate in hoof baths against digital dermatitis remains largely unproven.},

	abstract = {Diagnosis of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in beef cattle placed in feedlots is typically based on clinical illness (CI) detected by pen-checkers. Unfortunately, the accuracy of this diagnostic approach (namely, sensitivity [Se] and specificity [Sp]) remains poorly understood, in part due to the absence of a reference test for ante-mortem diagnosis of BRD. Our objective was to pool available estimates of CI's diagnostic accuracy for BRD diagnosis in feedlot beef cattle while adjusting for the inaccuracy in the reference test. The presence of lung lesions (LU) at slaughter was used as the reference test. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify research articles comparing CI detected by pen-checkers during the feeding period to LU at slaughter. A hierarchical Bayesian latent-class meta-analysis was used to model test accuracy. This approach accounted for imperfections of both tests as well as the within and between study variability in the accuracy of CI. Furthermore, it also predicted the SeCI and SpCI for future studies. Conditional independence between CI and LU was assumed, as these two tests are not based on similar biological principles. Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. Estimated pooled SeCI and SpCI were 0.27 (95\% Bayesian credible interval: 0.12-0.65) and 0.92 (0.72-0.98), respectively, whereas estimated pooled SeLU and SpLU were 0.91 (0.82-0.99) and 0.67 (0.64-0.79). Predicted SeCI and SpCI for future studies were 0.27 (0.01-0.96) and 0.92 (0.14-1.00), respectively. The wide credible intervals around predicted SeCI and SpCI estimates indicated considerable heterogeneity among studies, which suggests that pooled SeCI and SpCI are not generalizable to individual studies. In conclusion, CI appeared to have poor Se but high Sp for BRD diagnosis in feedlots. Furthermore, considerable heterogeneity among studies highlighted an urgent need to standardize BRD diagnosis in feedlots.},

Articles were assigned a level of evidence based on a modified grading system. Thirty-eight articles were included in the review. Thirty-six articles were classified as grade 4 and two as grade 5. The timings and methods of assessment of short- and long-term outcomes varied widely between studies. One prospective study (grade 4a) showed that surgically treated dogs survived significantly longer than medically treated dogs. Four retrospective studies (grade 4b) compared the outcome of two surgical techniques but there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in terms of complications or outcome. The review found that the evidence base for the treatment of extrahepatic CPSS is weak. There is a lack of evidence of short- and long-term outcomes to recommend one treatment over another.},

The bacterium causing Johne's disease, Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, is distributed worldwide and causes chronic granulomatous enteritis, also known as paratuberculosis, in domestic and exotic ruminants, including cattle. The subclinical form of this disease results in progressive weight loss, reduced milk production, lower slaughter value, and premature culling, with possible impacts on fertility and udder health. Eventually, infection can lead to the clinical form that manifests as chronic diarrhea, emaciation, debilitation, and eventual death. Currently, available tests to detect infected animals produce many false-negative results and some false-positives, particularly in subclinically infected animals, thus making their interpretation and utilization challenging in control programs. The objective of this 2-part review is to critically review the literature about Johne's disease in dairy cattle for bovine practitioners in Canada. Part I covers the clinical stages, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and prevalence of infection in Canada, while Part II discusses impacts, risk factors, and control programs relevant to Canadian dairy farms. By reviewing the scientific literature about Johne's disease, control of the disease could be pursued through informed implementation of rational biosecurity efforts and the strategic use of testing and culling.},

	abstract = {In human medicine, the information infrastructure that supports the knowledge translation processes of exchange, synthesis, dissemination, and application of the best clinical intervention research has developed significantly in the past 15 years, facilitating the uptake of research evidence by clinicians as well as the practice of evidence-based medicine. Seven of the key elements of this improved information infrastructure are clinical trial registries, research reporting standards, systematic reviews, organizations that support the production of systematic reviews, the indexing of clinical intervention research in MEDLINE, clinical search filters for MEDLINE, and point-of-care decision support information resources. The objective of this paper is to describe why these elements are important for evidence-based medicine, the key developments and issues related to these seven information infrastructure elements in human medicine, how these 7 elements compare with the corresponding infrastructure elements in veterinary medicine, and how all of these factors affect the translation of clinical intervention research into clinical practice. A focused search of the Ovid MEDLINE database was conducted for English language journal literature published between 2000 and 2010. Two bibliographies were consulted and selected national and international Web sites were searched using Google. The literature reviewed indicates that the information infrastructure supporting evidence-based veterinary medicine practice in all of the 7 elements reviewed is significantly underdeveloped in relation to the corresponding information infrastructure in human medicine. This lack of development creates barriers to the timely translation of veterinary medicine research into clinical practice and also to the conduct of both primary clinical intervention research and synthesis research.},

Multiple correspondence analysis and log-linear regression methods were used to establish the relationships between the studied variables and the number of PCV2 infected pigs that developed PMWS. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, the most successful animal experiment aimed to develop PMWS should include: (1) colostrum-deprived pigs, (2) age of inoculation below 3 weeks, (3) high doses of PCV2 inoculum, (4) PCV2 strain from genotype 1, and (5) co-infection with another swine pathogen as a triggering factor.},

	abstract = {The goal of the REFLECT Statement (Reporting guidElines For randomized controLled trials in livEstoCk and food safeTy) (published in 2010) was to provide the veterinary research community with reporting guidelines tailored for randomized controlled trials for livestock and food safety. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of REFLECT Statement reporting of items 1-19 in controlled trials published in journals between 1970 and 2017 examining the comparative efficacy of FDA-registered antimicrobials against naturally acquired BRD (bovine respiratory disease) in weaned beef calves in Canada or the USA, and to compare the prevalence of reporting before and after 2010, when REFLECT was published. We divided REFLECT Statement, items 3, 5, 10, and 11 into subitems, because each dealt with multiple elements requiring separate assessment. As a result, 28 different items or subitems were evaluated independently. We searched MEDLINE((R)) and CABI (CAB Abstracts((R)) and Global Health((R))) (Web of Science) in April 2017 and screened 2327 references. Two reviewers independently assessed the reporting of each item and subitem. Ninety-five references were eligible for the study. The reporting of the REFLECT items showed a point estimate for the prevalence ratio {\textgreater}1 (i.e. a higher proportion of studies published post-2010 reported this item compared to studies published pre-2010), apart from items 10.3, i.e., item 10, subitem 3 (who assigned study units to the interventions), 13 (the flow of study units through the study), 16 (number of study units in analysis), 18 (multiplicity), and 19 (adverse effects). Fifty-three (79\%) of 67 studies published before 2010 and all 28 (100\%) papers published after 2010 reported using a random allocation method in either the title, abstract, or methods (Prevalence ratio=1.25; 95\% CI (1.09,1.43)). However, 8 studies published prior to 2010 and 7 studies published post-2010 reported the term "systematic randomization" or variations of this term (which is not true randomization) to describe the allocation procedure. Fifty-five percent (37/67) of studies published pre-2010 reported blinding status (blinded/not blinded) of outcome assessors, compared to 24/28 (86\%) of studies published post-2010 (Prevalence ratio=1.5, 95\% CI (1.19, 2.02)). The reporting of recommended items in journal articles in this body of work is generally improving; however, there is also evidence of confusion about what constitutes a random allocation procedure, and this suggests an educational need. As this study is observational, this precludes concluding that the publication of the REFLECT Statement was the cause of this trend.},

	abstract = {Our objective was to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination and biosecurity on the prevalence of \_Salmonella\_ spp. in broiler chickens using systematic review and meta-analysis. A comprehensive search of the global primary literature was conducted in: Current Contents (1999-2009), Agricola (1924-2009), MEDLINE (1860-2009), Scopus (1960-2009), CAB (1913-2009), and Centre for Agricultural Bioscience Global Health (1971-2009). The search algorithm was (Salmonell*) AND (chicken* OR chick* OR poultry* OR broiler* OR gallus*). Additional studies were identified by contacting five topic experts and hand-scanning bibliographies of recent review articles and a recently published textbook. Studies were included if they were English language and investigated the effects of vaccination and biosecurity on the prevalence of \_Salmonella\_ spp. in broiler chickens. All study design types were included. Data extraction and methodological assessment were conducted by two reviewers independently. All meta-analyses were based on random-effects models. For biosecurity, sixteen challenge studies (\_n\_=137 treatment-control comparisons) and one controlled study (\_n\_=2) met the inclusion criteria. Significant heterogeneity (Cochran's \_Q\_-statistic, \_p\_{\textless}0.001) was observed among biosecurity challenge studies examining hydrogen peroxide or polyhexamethylenebiguanide hydrochloride applied to hatching eggs, making it inappropriate to present a summary effects measure. For vaccination, 19 challenge studies (\_n\_=226) and three controlled studies (\_n\_=10) met the inclusion criteria. Among live \_Salmonella\_ Typhimurium vaccine challenge studies heterogeneity was not significant (\_p\_=0.138). Vaccination with a live \_Salmonella\_ Typhimurium reduced the risk of \_Salmonella\_ cecal colonization in the treated broiler group by 35 out of 1000 broilers when compared to the control group (OR=0.21; 95\% CI=0.06-0.77) and this effect was significant (\_p\_=0.018). One biosecurity study (\_n\_=2 treatment-control comparisons) and three vaccination studies (\_n\_=10) were conducted in a commercial setting. The two included studies in the vaccination meta-analysis were both conducted at research facilities. The live \_Salmonella\_ Typhimurium vaccine showed the most promise in reducing the prevalence of \_Salmonella\_ in broiler ceca. However, the meta-analysis included few studies, and these studies challenged the birds with different serotypes. We recommend that more large-scale randomized, blinded trials be conducted with a live \_Salmonella\_ Typhimurium vaccine on commercial farms.},

Our objectives were to determine the efficacy of feed and water additives (other than competitive exclusion and antimicrobials) on reducing Salmonella prevalence or concentration in broiler chickens using systematic review-meta-analysis and to explore sources of heterogeneity found in the meta-analysis through meta-regression. Six electronic databases were searched (Current Contents (1999-2009), Agricola (1924-2009), MEDLINE (1860-2009), Scopus (1960-2009), Centre for Agricultural Bioscience (CAB) (1913-2009), and CAB Global Health (1971-2009)), five topic experts were contacted, and the bibliographies of review articles and a topic-relevant textbook were manually searched to identify all relevant research. Study inclusion criteria comprised: English-language primary research investigating the effects of feed and water additives on the Salmonella prevalence or concentration in broiler chickens. Data extraction and study methodological assessment were conducted by two reviewers independently using pretested forms. Seventy challenge studies (n=910 unique treatment-control comparisons), seven controlled studies (n=154), and one quasi-experiment (n=1) met the inclusion criteria. Compared to an assumed control group prevalence of 44 of 1000 broilers, random-effects meta-analysis indicated that the Salmonella cecal colonization in groups with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharide, lactose, whey, dried milk, lactulose, lactosucrose, sucrose, maltose, mannanoligosaccharide) added to feed or water was 15 out of 1000 broilers; with lactose added to feed or water it was 10 out of 1000 broilers; with experimental chlorate product (ECP) added to feed or water it was 21 out of 1000. For ECP the concentration of Salmonella in the ceca was decreased by 0.61 log(10)cfu/g in the treated group compared to the control group. Significant heterogeneity (Cochran's Q-statistic p{\textless}/=0.10) was observed among studies examining all organic acids (controlled or challenge experiments), butyric acid, formic acid, a formic/propionic acid mixture, fermented liquid feed, and D-mannose. Meta-regressions were conducted to examine the source of heterogeneity among studies. For prevalence outcomes, 36\% and 60\% of the total variance was within and between studies, respectively. For concentration outcomes, 39\% and 33\% of the total variance was within and between studies, respectively. Inadequate blinding and randomization was common, and no studies undergoing meta-analysis or meta-regression were conducted on a commercial farm. The strength of evidence of the effect of these additives was very low. Studies conducted under commercial conditions are needed to understand the potential benefit of these interventions for the poultry industry and to improve the strength of evidence of the effectiveness of these additives.},

This systematic review synthesizes data on swine influenza virology, serology and epidemiology in East and Southeast Asia. A total of 77 research articles, literature reviews and conference papers were selected and analyzed from 510 references retrieved from PubMed and ISI Web of KnowledgeSM. The number of published articles increased in the last 3 years, which may be attributed to improvement in monitoring and/or a better promotion of surveillance data. Nevertheless, large inequalities in surveillance and research among countries are underlined. Virological results represent the largest part of published data, while the serological and epidemiological features of swine influenza in East and Southeast Asia remain poorly described. The literature shows that there have been several emergences of swine influenza in the region, and also considerable evidence of multiple introductions of North American and avian-like European strains. Furthermore, several avian-origin strains are isolated from pigs, including H5 and H9 subtypes. However, their low seroprevalence in swine also shows that pigs remain poorly infected by these subtypes. We conclude that sero-epidemioligical investigations have been neglected, and that they may help to improve virological surveillance. Inter- and intra-continental surveillance of gene flows will benefit the region. Greater investment is needed in swine influenza surveillance, to improve our knowledge of circulating strains as well as the epidemiology and disease burden in the region.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the literature on the efficacy of equine assisted activities and therapies (EAAT) on gross motor outcomes representing the ICF component of body functions and activity in children with cerebral palsy (CP). METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational studies of hippotherapy (HPOT) and therapeutic horseback riding (TR) for children with spastic CP. Gross motor outcomes, assessed via muscle activity and muscle tone, gait, posture and Gross Motor Function Measures (GMFM) were evaluated. RESULTS: Five TR studies and nine HPOT studies were included. Our meta-analysis indicated that short-term HPOT (total riding time 8-10 min) significantly reduced asymmetrical activity of the hip adductor muscles. HPOT could improve postural control in children with spastic CP, GMFCS level {\textless} 5. However, the evidence did not show a statistically significant effect on GMFM after long-term HPOT or TR (total riding time, 8-22 h) in children with spastic CP. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review found insufficient evidence to support the claim that long-term TR or HPOT provide a significant benefit to children with spastic CP. We found no statistically significant evidence of either therapeutic effect or maintenance effects on the gross motor activity status in CP children.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Wild birds and especially migratory species can become long-distance vectors for a wide range of microorganisms. The objective of the current paper is to summarize available literature on pathogens causing human disease that have been associated with wild bird species. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify specific pathogens known to be associated with wild and migratory birds. The evidence for direct transmission of an avian borne pathogen to a human was assessed. Transmission to humans was classified as direct if there is published evidence for such transmission from the avian species to a person or indirect if the transmission requires a vector other than the avian species. RESULTS: Several wild and migratory birds serve as reservoirs and/or mechanical vectors (simply carrying a pathogen or dispersing infected arthropod vectors) for numerous infectious agents. An association with transmission from birds to humans was identified for 10 pathogens. Wild birds including migratory species may play a significant role in the epidemiology of influenza A virus, arboviruses such as West Nile virus and enteric bacterial pathogens. Nevertheless only one case of direct transmission from wild birds to humans was found. CONCLUSION: The available evidence suggests wild birds play a limited role in human infectious diseases. Direct transmission of an infectious agent from wild birds to humans is rarely identified. Potential factors and mechanisms involved in the transmission of infectious agents from birds to humans need further elucidation.},

A scoping study (ScS) was conducted to characterize published research investigating selected zoonotic bacteria and public health topics in various wild and farmed aquatic species and seafood. This was followed by a systematic review (SR) on selected bacteria (Aeromonas spp., generic Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Vibrio spp.) and aquatic species (clams, mussels, oysters, salmon, and shrimp [including prawn]); a meta-analysis (MA) was conducted only at the retail level due to considerable variability among various pathogen/seafood combinations. The ScS revealed the most frequently investigated themes were farm-level prevalence and intervention research for Vibrio spp. and Aeromonas spp. Antimicrobial use (AMU) and the association between AMU and antimicrobial resistance were rarely investigated. The SR indicated a consistent lack of reporting regarding study methodology and results, precluding the use of many studies in and full benefits of MA. MA of Aeromonas, E. coli, and Salmonella prevalence in retail salmon resulted in pooled estimates of 13\% (6-27\%), 2\% (0.1-11\%), and 1\% (0-5\%), respectively. When MA of pathogen/seafood combination resulted in statistically significant heterogeneity (p{\textless}0.1), median/range were reported at the region level. The results from our ScS, SR, and MA could be used for better design of future bacteriological surveys of seafood and as inputs for risk assessments or surveillance initiatives in this field.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a contagious, fatal prion disease affecting cervids in a growing number of regions across North America. Projected deer population declines and concern about potential spread of CWD to other species warrant strategies to manage this disease. Control efforts to date have been largely unsuccessful, resulting in continuing spread and increasing prevalence. This systematic review summarizes peer-reviewed published reports describing field-applicable CWD control strategies in wild deer populations in North America using systematic review methods. Ten databases were searched for peer-reviewed literature. Following deduplication, relevance screening, full-text appraisal, subject matter expert review and qualitative data extraction, nine references were included describing four distinct management strategies. RESULTS: Six of the nine studies used predictive modeling to evaluate control strategies. All six demonstrated one or more interventions to be effective but results were dependant on parameters and assumptions used in the model. Three found preferential removal of CWD infected deer to be effective in reducing CWD prevalence; one model evaluated a test and slaughter strategy, the other selective removal of infected deer by predators and the third evaluated increased harvest of the sex with highest prevalence (males). Three models evaluated non-selective harvest of deer. There were only three reports that examined primary data collected as part of observational studies. Two of these studies supported the effectiveness of intensive non-selective culling; the third study did not find a difference between areas that were subjected to culling and those that were not. Seven of the nine studies were conducted in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the paucity of evaluated, field-applicable control strategies for CWD in wild deer populations. Knowledge gaps in the complex epidemiology of CWD and the intricacies inherent to prion diseases currently pose significant challenges to effective control of this disease in wild deer in North America.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The threat posed by highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 viruses to humans remains significant, given the continued occurrence of sporadic human cases (499 human cases in 15 countries) with a high case fatality rate (approximately 60\%), the endemicity in poultry populations in several countries, and the potential for reassortment with the newly emerging 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain. Therefore, we review risk factors for H5N1 infection in humans. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Several epidemiologic studies have evaluated the risk factors associated with increased risk of H5N1 infection among humans who were exposed to H5N1 viruses. Our review shows that most H5N1 cases are attributed to exposure to sick poultry. Most cases are sporadic, while occasional limited human-to-human transmission occurs. The most commonly identified factors associated with H5N1 virus infection included exposure through contact with infected blood or bodily fluids of infected poultry via food preparation practices; touching and caring for infected poultry; consuming uncooked poultry products; exposure to H5N1 via swimming or bathing in potentially virus laden ponds; and exposure to H5N1 at live bird markets. CONCLUSIONS: Research has demonstrated that despite frequent and widespread contact with poultry, transmission of the H5N1 virus from poultry to humans is rare. Available research has identified several risk factors that may be associated with infection including close direct contact with poultry and transmission via the environment. However, several important data gaps remain that limit our understanding of the epidemiology of H5N1 in humans. Although infection in humans with H5N1 remains rare, human cases continue to be reported and H5N1 is now considered endemic among poultry in parts of Asia and in Egypt, providing opportunities for additional human infections and for the acquisition of virus mutations that may lead to more efficient spread among humans and other mammalian species. Collaboration between human and animal health sectors for surveillance, case investigation, virus sharing, and risk assessment is essential to monitor for potential changes in circulating H5N1 viruses and in the epidemiology of H5N1 in order to provide the best possible chance for effective mitigation of the impact of H5N1 in both poultry and humans.

	abstract = {A dry period of 6-8weeks for dairy cows is generally thought to maximise milk production in the next lactation. However, the value of such a long dry period is increasingly questioned. In particular, shortening the dry period shifts milk production from the critical period after calving to the weeks before calving. This shift in milk production could improve the energy balance (EB), health and fertility of dairy cows. The objective of this study was to systematically review the current knowledge on dry period length in relation to milk production, EB, fertility, and health of cows and calves. A meta-analysis was performed for variables where at least five studies were available. Overall, both shortening and omitting the dry period reduces milk production, increases milk protein percentage and tends to reduce the risk of ketosis in the next lactation. Individual studies reported an improvement of EB after a short or no dry period, compared with a conventional dry period. Shortening or omitting the dry period did not affect milk fat percentage and shortening the dry period did not alter the odds ratio for mastitis, metritis, or fertility measures in the next lactation. So, current evidence for an improvement of health and fertility of dairy cows is marginal and may be partly explained by the limited number of studies which have evaluated health and fertility in relation to dry period length, the limited number of animals in those studies and the variable responses reported.},

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were: 1) to evaluate the risk of bias assessment in animal-based systematic reviews, and 2) to study the internal validity of the primary animal studies included in these systematic reviews. DATA SOURCES: We systematically searched Pubmed and Embase for SRs of preclinical animal studies published between 2005 and 2012. RESULTS: A total of 91 systematic reviews met our inclusion criteria. The risk of bias was assessed in 48 (52.7\%) of these 91 systematic reviews. Thirty-three (36.3\%) SRs provided sufficient information to evaluate the internal validity of the included studies. Of the evaluated primary studies, 24.6\% was randomized, 14.6\% reported blinding of the investigator/caretaker, 23.9\% blinded the outcome assessment, and 23.1\% reported drop-outs. CONCLUSIONS: To improve the translation of animal data to clinical practice, systematic reviews of animal studies are worthwhile, but the internal validity of primary animal studies needs to be improved. Furthermore, risk of bias should be assessed by systematic reviews of animal studies to provide insight into the reliability of the available evidence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Q fever is a common cause of febrile illness and community-acquired pneumonia in resource-limited settings. Coxiella burnetii, the causative pathogen, is transmitted among varied host species, but the epidemiology of the organism in Africa is poorly understood. We conducted a systematic review of C. burnetii epidemiology in Africa from a "One Health" perspective to synthesize the published data and identify knowledge gaps. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We searched nine databases to identify articles relevant to four key aspects of C. burnetii epidemiology in human and animal populations in Africa: infection prevalence; disease incidence; transmission risk factors; and infection control efforts. We identified 929 unique articles, 100 of which remained after full-text review. Of these, 41 articles describing 51 studies qualified for data extraction. Animal seroprevalence studies revealed infection by C. burnetii ({\textless}/=13\%) among cattle except for studies in Western and Middle Africa (18-55\%). Small ruminant seroprevalence ranged from 11-33\%. Human seroprevalence was {\textless}8\% with the exception of studies among children and in Egypt (10-32\%). Close contact with camels and rural residence were associated with increased seropositivity among humans. C. burnetii infection has been associated with livestock abortion. In human cohort studies, Q fever accounted for 2-9\% of febrile illness hospitalizations and 1-3\% of infective endocarditis cases. We found no studies of disease incidence estimates or disease control efforts. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: C. burnetii infection is detected in humans and in a wide range of animal species across Africa, but seroprevalence varies widely by species and location. Risk factors underlying this variability are poorly understood as is the role of C. burnetii in livestock abortion. Q fever consistently accounts for a notable proportion of undifferentiated human febrile illness and infective endocarditis in cohort studies, but incidence estimates are lacking. C. burnetii presents a real yet underappreciated threat to human and animal health throughout Africa.},

OBJECTIVES: To review systematically the literature about the effects of nutraceuticals on clinical signs of pain or abnormal locomotion in horses, dogs, and cats, and to discuss methodological aspects of trials and systematic reviews. METHODS: A systematic search of controlled trials evaluating the impact of nutraceuticals on OA in horses, dogs, and cats was performed, using Medline, CAB Abstracts, and Google Scholar. Scientific evidence was evaluated by means of criteria proposed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and a scoring system adapted from both the CONsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement and recommendations for assessing trials by the Center of Evidence Based Medicine of Oxford. RESULTS: Twenty-two papers were selected and reviewed, with 5 studies performed in horses, 16 in dogs, and 1 in cats. The strength of evidence was low for all nutraceuticals except for omega-3 fatty acid in dogs. There were limited numbers of rigorous randomized controlled trials and of participants in clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The evidence of efficacy of nutraceuticals is poor, with the exception of diets supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids in dogs. Greater access to systematic reviews must be part of the objectives of the veterinary science in the future.

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the existing information on the efficacy of commercial vaccination to reduce the prevalence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in weaned cattle in beef feedlot finishing systems under commercial conditions. Currently, only two commercial vaccines exist, and thus, only publications reporting the use of vaccines targeting type III secreted proteins and/or siderophore receptor and porin proteins (SRP) were considered relevant. A total of 18 studies reporting 45 comparisons were included in this review. Meta-analyses were conducted variously on (i) pre-harvest outcomes, (ii) at-harvest outcomes and (iii) both pre-harvest and at-harvest outcomes combined. Overall, efficacy of vaccination was consistently observed. Efficacy and homogeneity of the results was demonstrated for the two-dose regimen, allowing us to conclude with confidence that the two-dose approach is efficacious. For pre-harvest outcomes and two-dose regimens, the odds ratios (OR) were 0.53 (95\% CI = 0.45-0.62) for the two vaccines combined and 0.49 (95\% CI = 0.40-0.60) for vaccine targeting type III secreted proteins. The test for heterogeneity among studies yielded a Q test P = 0.354 for the two vaccines combined and Q test P = 0.269 for the vaccine targeting type III secreted proteins, indicating homogeneity in both cases. For pre- and at-harvest outcomes combined and two-dose regimens, the odds ratios (OR) were 0.52 (95\% CI = 0.44-0.61) for the two vaccines combined and 0.45 (95\% CI = 0.34-0.60) for vaccine targeting type III secreted proteins. The test for heterogeneity among studies yielded a Q test P = 0.134 for the two vaccines combined indicating homogeneity and Q test P = 0.089 for the vaccine targeting type III secreted proteins indicating heterogeneity. Based on this meta-analysis, bovine vaccination appears to be an effective approach to the pre-harvest control of E. coli O157:H7.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews both the beneficial and adverse effects of permissive hypercapnic respiratory acidosis in critically ill newborn foals. It has been shown that partial carbon dioxide pressure (PCO2) above the traditional safe range (hypercapnia), has beneficial effects on the physiology of the respiratory, cardiovascular, and nervous system in neonates. In human neonatal critical care medicine permissive hypercapnic acidosis is generally well-tolerated by patients and is more beneficial to their wellbeing than normal carbon dioxide (CO2) pressure or normocapnia. Even though adverse effects of hypercapnia have been reported, especially in patients with central nervous system pathology and/or chronic infection, critical care clinicians often artificially increase PCO2 to take advantage of its positive effects on compromised neonate tissues. This is referred to as therapeutic hypercapnia. Hypercapnic respiratory acidosis is common in critically ill newborn foals and has traditionally been considered as not beneficial. A search of online scientific databases was conducted to survey the literature on the effects of hypercapnia in neonates, with emphasis on newborn foals. The dynamic status of safety levels of PCO2 and data on the effectiveness of different carbon dioxide levels are not available for newborn foals and should be scientifically determined. Presently, permissive hypercapnia should be implemented or tolerated cautiously in compromised newborn foals and its use should be based on relevant data from adult horses and other species.},

	abstract = {Predictive models of parasite life cycles increase our understanding of how parasite epidemiology is influenced by global changes and can be used to support decisions for more targeted worm control. Estimates of parasite population dynamics are needed to parameterize such models. The aim of this study was to quantify the main life history traits of Ostertagia ostertagi, economically the most important nematode of cattle in temperate regions. The main parameters determining parasite density during the parasitic phase of O. ostertagi are (i) the larval establishment rate, (ii) hypobiosis rate, (iii) adult mortality and (iv) female fecundity (number of eggs laid per day per female). A systematic review was performed covering studies from 1962 to 2007, in which helminth-naive calves were artificially infected with O. ostertagi. The database was further extended with results of unpublished trials conducted at the Laboratory for Parasitology of Ghent University, Belgium. Overall inverse variance weighted estimates were computed for each of the traits through random effects models. An average establishment rate (+/-S.E.) of 0.269+/-0.022 was calculated based on data of 27 studies (46 experiments). The establishment rate declined when infection dose increased and was lower in younger animals. An average proportion of larvae entering hypobiosis (+/-S.E.) of 0.041 (+/-0.009) was calculated based on 27 studies (54 experiments). The proportion of ingested larvae that went into hypobiosis was higher in animals that received concomitant infections with nematode species other than O. ostertagi (mixed infections). An average daily adult mortality (+/-S.E.) of 0.028 (+/-0.002) was computed based on data from 28 studies (70 experiments). Adult mortality was positively correlated with infection dose. A daily fecundity (+/-S.E.) of 284 (+/-45) eggs per female was found based on nine studies (10 experiments). The average female sex ratio of O. ostertagi based on individual animal data (n=75) from six different studies was estimated to be 0.55. We believe that this systematic review is the first to summarise the available data on the main life history traits of the parasitic phase of O. ostertagi. In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides novel estimates for the parameterization of life cycle-based transmission models, explicitly reports measures of variance around these estimates, gives evidence for density dependence of larval establishment and adult mortality, shows that host age affects larval establishment and, to our knowledge, provides the first evidence for O. ostertagi of a female-biased sex ratio.},

	abstract = {Leptospirosis is a bacterial systemic infection which affects domestic animals and wildlife, as well as humans. Many wild animals act as reservoirs of leptospires. Nevertheless, the real role of wildlife animals as source of infection to livestock and humans, as well as the most important reservoirs and leptospiral strains remains unclear. This systematic review assesses the available data about wildlife and their biomes in Latin America, concerning to leptospiral infection. In addition, we discuss the development of the research on leptospirosis in wildlife in this region. After the application of exclusion criteria, 79 papers were analyzed, comprising 186 species, 122 genus, 53 families, and 19 orders from four classes. Mammals were the most studied class, followed by Amphibian, Reptile, and Aves. The Icterohaemorrhagiae serogroup was predominant in most biomes and many orders. A small number of antigens detected the majority of seroreactive animals of each class, and a smaller panel may be used at microscopic agglutination test. Further studies must always consider edaphoclimatic conditions besides only host class or species, in order to obtain a broader understanding of the wild epidemiological cycle of leptospirosis in the region. In conclusion, direct and indirect evidences demonstrate that leptospirosis is largely widespread among wildlife in all biomes of Latin America. Moreover, more research on the role of wildlife on the epidemiology of leptospirosis and its impact on livestock and public health are required, particularly focusing on direct detection of the agent.},

In this paper we reviewed published models of the bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) spread within a herd. Modelling options and assumptions on herd dynamics and BVDV transmission were discussed. A cattle herd is a population with a controlled size. Animals are separated into subgroups according to their age or their physiological status inducing heterogeneity of horizontal transmission. Complexity of models results from: (1) horizontal and vertical virus transmission, (2) birth of persistently infected animals, (3) excretion by transiently and persistently infected animals. Areas where there was a lack of knowledge were identified. Assumptions on the force of infection used to model the horizontal virus transmission were presented and discussed. We proposed possible ways of improving models (e.g. force of infection, validation) and essential model features for further BVDV models.},

	abstract = {Nontyphoidal Salmonella are one of the leading causes of foodborne diseases in the world. As poultry products are recognized as main sources of human salmonellosis, nontyphoidal Salmonella control has become a global issue for the poultry industry. The increasing antimicrobial resistance in poultry-related nontyphoidal Salmonella serovars is a global matter of concern. By monitoring the evolution of antimicrobial resistance, alternative treatments can be identified and possible restrictions in the treatment of systemic human salmonellosis foreseen. A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the profile and temporal evolution of the antimicrobial resistance of nontyphoidal Salmonella of poultry and human origin in Brazil, isolated in the period from 1995 to 2014. Four databases were researched; twenty-nine articles met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. In the nontyphoidal isolates of poultry origin, the highest levels of antimicrobial resistance were verified for sulfonamides (44.3\%), nalidixic acid (42.5\%), and tetracycline (35.5\%). In the human-origin isolates, the resistance occurred mainly for sulfonamides (46.4\%), tetracycline (36.9\%), and ampicillin (23.6\%). Twenty-two articles described results of antimicrobial resistance specifically for Salmonella Enteritidis, also enabling the individual meta-analysis of this serovar. For most antimicrobials, the resistance levels of Salmonella Enteritidis were lower than those found when considering all the nontyphoidal serovars. In the poultry-origin isolates, a quadratic temporal distribution was observed, with reduced resistance to streptomycin in Salmonella Enteritidis and in all nontyphoidal serovars, and a linear increase of resistance to nalidixic acid in Salmonella Enteritidis. In the human-origin isolates, a linear increase was identified in the resistance to nalidixic acid in Salmonella Enteritidis and in all the nontyphoidal isolates, and to gentamicin in Salmonella Enteritidis. Continuous monitoring of the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance could support the measurement of the consequences on poultry and human health.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The present systematic review attempted to determine the prevalence of Linguatula serrata (L. serrata) infection among Iranian livestock. The L. serrata known as tongue worm belongs to the phylum pentastomida and lives in upper respiratory system and nasal airways of carnivores. Herbivores and other ruminants are intermediate hosts. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library were searched from Nov 1996 to 22 Apr 2019 by searching terms including "Linguatula serrata", "linguatulosis", "pentastomida", "bovine", "cattle", "cow", "buffalo", "sheep", "ovine", "goat", "camel", "Iran", and "prevalence" alone or in combination. The search was conducted in Persian databases of Magiran, Iran doc, Barakatkns (Iran medex) and Scientific Information Database (SID) with the same keywords. After reviewing the full texts of 133 published studies, 50 studies had the eligibility criteria to enter our review. RESULTS: By random effects model analysis, the pooled prevalence of linguatulosis was 25\% (95\%CI: 18.0-33.0, I (2) = 98.67 \% , P {\textless} 0.001) in goats; 15.0\% (95\%CI: 10.0-20.0, I (2) = 97.95 \% , P {\textless} 0.001) in sheep; 12.0\% (95\%CI: 7.0-18.0, I (2) = 98.05 \% , P {\textless} 0.001) in cattle; 7\% (95\%CI: 2.0-16.0, I (2) = 97.52\%) in buffalos and 11.0\% (95\%CI: 6.0-16.0\%, I (2) = 96.26 \% , P {\textless} 0.001) in camels. The overall prevalence in livestock was estimated to be 25\%. The highest infection rate was recorded in West Azerbaijan Province (68\%) and the lowest rate was in Khuzestan Province (0.23\%) (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the high prevalence of L. serrata infection in livestock (mainly ovine linguatulosis) show the endemic status of linguatulosis in several parts of Iran and will pose a risk for inhabitants.

METHODS: EBSCO, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Embase Classic/Embase, and MEDLINE were searched using terms including "vitamins," "amino acids," "healing," "muscle," and "tendon." The primary search had 479 citations, of which 466 were excluded predominantly due to nonrandomized design. Randomized human and animal studies investigating all supplement types/forms of administration were included. Critical appraisal of internal validity was assessed using the Cochrane risk of Bias Tool or the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation Risk of Bias Tool for human and animal studies, respectively. Two reviewers performed duel data extraction. RESULTS: Twelve studies met criteria for inclusion: eight examined tendon healing and four examined muscle healing. All studies used animal models, except two human trials using a combined integrator. Narrative synthesis was performed via content analysis of demonstrated statistically significant effects and thematic analysis of proposed physiological mechanisms of intervention. Vitamin C/taurine demonstrated indirect effects on tendon healing through antioxidant activity. Vitamin A/glycine showed direct effects on extracellular matrix tissue synthesis. Vitamin E shows an antiproliferative influence on collagen deposition. Leucine directly influences signaling pathways to promote muscle protein synthesis. DISCUSSION: Preliminary evidence exists, demonstrating that vitamins and amino acids may facilitate multilevel changes in musculotendinous healing; however, recommendations on clinical utility should be made with caution. All animal studies and one human study showed high risk of bias with moderate interobserver agreement (k = 0.46). Currently, there is limited evidence to support the use of vitamins and amino acids for musculotendinous injury. Both high-quality animal experimentation of the proposed mechanisms confirming the physiological influence of supplementation and human studies evaluating effects on tissue morphology and biochemistry are required before practical application.},

Evaluation of the weighted prevalences among included studies was done using random-effects model. Totally, 30 studies (34 datasets) reported from 19 countries were included in the present work. Microsporidia infection demonstrated higher prevalence rates using microscopy 29.7 \% (19.7-42.2 \%), followed by serology and molecular techniques with 11 \% (4.6-24.2 \%) and 8.2 \% (5.9-11.4 \%), respectively. Moreover, molecular data showed Enterocytozoon bieneusi as the most dominant reported species with 7.4 \% (5.1-10.5 \%). Also, investigations (11 studies) mostly isolated D genotype among all E. bieneusi genotypes. These results highlight cats as a potential reservoir for acquisition of microsporidia infection in humans, and surveillance programs should be implemented in high-risk areas.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Co-infection of intestinal helminthic infections (IHIs) and tuberculosis (TB) has appeared as a public health issue, especially in developing countries. Some recent studies have been carried out on the possible relevance of IHIs to TB. The current systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the prevalence and odds ratio (OR) of IHIs among TB patients and clarify the relationship between IHIs and TB disease. METHODS: For the purpose of the study, five English databases including PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science (ISI), and Google scholar were searched (up to January 30, 2019) in order to find the related studies. Random-effects meta-analysis model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence, odds ratio (OR), and 95\% confidence interval (CI). Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. RESULTS: A total of 20 studies including 10 studies with case-control design (2217 patients and 2520 controls) and 10 studies with cross-sectional design (a total of 2415 participants) met the eligibility criteria. As shown by the random-effects model, the pooled prevalence of IHIs in TB patients was estimated to be 26\% (95\% CI, 17-35\%; 1249/4632). The risk of IHI was higher in TB patients compared to controls but this was not statistically significant. However, according to genus/species, the pooled OR of Strongyloides stercoralis (S. stercoralis) (OR, 2.68; 95\% CI, 1.59-4.54) had a significantly higher risk in TB patients compared to controls. Nevertheless, the results of random effects model showed no statistically significant association between overall pooled OR of IHIs in TB patients compared to controls in case-control studies (OR, 1; 95\% CI, 0-1). CONCLUSIONS: It is highly recommended that more precise studies should be carried out by researchers in order to better understand this association. Also, it is of great importance to include the periodic screenings for IHIs in the routine clinical care of these patients.},

	abstract = {Cryptosporidiosis, caused by the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium spp., is an important zoonotic disease and is considered a global public health concern. Dogs are suggested as one of potential reservoirs for transmitting the Cryptosporidium infection to humans. However, there is a paucity of information about global patterns of occurrence of Cryptosporidium in dogs. A systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out to evaluate the global prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection among dogs. In this study, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched for relevant studies up until October 30, 2019. Finally, 127 articles (including 160 datasets) were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection was estimated at 8\% (95 \% CI: 5-11 \%) using microscopic methods, 7\% (95 \% CI: 4-10\%) using coprogantigenic methods and 6\% (95 \% CI: 4-9\%) using molecular diagnostic methods. Molecular methods revealed that dogs were most frequently infected by C. canis (3.64 \%) and C. parvum (1.28 \%). The pooled prevalence different of subgroups (WHO regions, geographic and climate parameters, diagnostic methods, type of dog) were analyzed separately. The pooled odds ratio (OR) of Cryptosporidium was significantly higher than one for diarrhea status, with dogs suffering from diarrhea having a higher likelihood of Cryptosporidium infection, compared to dogs without diarrhea (OR; 3.61 95 \% CI: 1.89-6.90\%). The present study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis providing a comprehensive view of the global prevalence of Cryptosporidium in dogs and its related risk factors. Awareness of Cryptosporidium prevalence, risk factors, and disease complications for the health authorities, physicians, veterinarians and dog's owners is important for developing effective strategies to prevent infection.},

	abstract = {The One-Health approach implies that the health of people is connected to the health of animals and the environment. Rodents, which are abundant and widespread, have been considered the major reservoirs of Cryptosporidium infection in humans and other animals. However, there is a paucity of information about global patterns of occurrence of Cryptosporidium in rodents. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled global prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection and associated risk factors in rodents. International databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google scholar) were systematically searched to identify relevant studies. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to estimate the overall and the subgroup-pooled prevalence of Cryptosporidium across studies, and the variance between studies (heterogeneity) were quantified by I(2) index. The data were classified according to WHO-region, type of diagnostic methods, different kinds of rodents, and specific risk factors, including geographical and climate parameters. Eighty-four articles (including 92 datasets), from 29 countries met eligibility criteria for analysis. The pooled global prevalence (95\% CI) of Cryptosporidium infection in rodents was 17\% (13-20\%), being highest in North American and Caribbean regions 27\% (16-40\%) and lowest in South American 5\% (0-16\%) countries. Considering the detection methods, the pooled prevalence was estimated to be 25\% (13-39\%) using coproantigen detection methods, 17\% (13-23\%) using molecular detection methods, and 14\% (9-20\%) using microscopic detection methods. The highest prevalence of Cryptosporidium was found in muskrats 47\% (27-68\%), while Meriones persicus 1\% (0-3\%) had the lowest prevalence. These results emphasize the role of rodents as reservoir hosts for human-infecting Cryptosporidium. This highlights the need for an increased focus on implementing affordable, appropriate control programs to reduce the public health threat of cryptosporidiosis as a zoonosis of global importance.},

We carried out a systematic literature review on E. granulosus s.l. human and animal (cattle, sheep, dog) infection in European Mediterranean and Balkan countries in 2000-2019, to provide a picture of its recent epidemiology in this endemic area. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar and Open Grey databases were searched. Included cases were: i) for humans, data from hospital records and imaging studies; ii) for dogs, data from necropsy and coprological studies; iii) for ruminants, cases based on slaughter inspection. The NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) classification was used to categorize extracted data in epidemiological units, defined as data referred to one NUTS2 (basic region) in one year time. Data were then aggregated to NUTS1 level (major regions), calculating the average incidence value of included epidemiological units. For prevalence studies covering different epidemiological units, the pooled prevalence was estimated. Data were extracted from 79 publications, 25 on human infection (covering 437 epidemiological units), and 54 on animal infection (52 epidemiological units for cattle, 35 for sheep and 25 for dogs). At NUTS1 level, average annual incidence rates of human CE ranged from 0.10-7.74/100,000; pooled prevalence values ranged from 0.003-64.09\% in cattle, 0.004-68.73\% in sheep, and 0-31.86\% in dogs. Southern and insular Italy, central Spain, Romania and Bulgaria reported the highest values. Bovine data showed a more similar pattern to human data compared to sheep and dogs. Limitation of evidence included the paucity of human prevalence studies, data heterogeneity, and the patchy geographical coverage, with lack of data especially for the Balkans. Our results confirm Italy, Spain, and Eastern Europe being the most affected areas, but data are extremely heterogeneous, geographical coverage very patchy, and human prevalence studies extremely scant. Results also highlight the notorious problem of underreporting of E. granulosus s.l. infection in both humans and animals.},

Limitations of diagnostic tests and nonspecificity of symptoms have hampered the estimation of the global morbidity due to strongyloidiasis. This work aimed at assessing S. stercoralis-associated morbidity through a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature. MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, LILACS, and trial registries (WHO portal) were searched. The study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Odds ratios (ORs) of the association between symptoms and infection status and frequency of infection-associated symptoms were calculated. Six articles from five countries, including 6,014 individuals, were included in the meta-analysis-three were of low quality, one of high quality, and two of very high quality. Abdominal pain (OR 1.74 [CI 1.07-2.94]), diarrhea (OR 1.66 [CI 1.09-2.55]), and urticaria (OR 1.73 [CI 1.22-2.44]) were associated with infection. In 17 eligible studies, these symptoms were reported by a large proportion of the individuals with strongyloidiasis-abdominal pain by 53.1\% individuals, diarrhea by 41.6\%, and urticaria by 27.8\%. After removing the low-quality studies, urticaria remained the only symptom significantly associated with S. stercoralis infection (OR 1.42 [CI 1.24-1.61]). Limitations of evidence included the low number and quality of studies. Our findings especially highlight the appalling knowledge gap about clinical manifestations of this common yet neglected soil-transmitted helminthiasis. Further studies focusing on morbidity and risk factors for dissemination and mortality due to strongyloidiasis are absolutely needed to quantify the burden of S. stercoralis infection and inform public health policies.},

	abstract = {The objective of the study was to review current literature to determine whether the topical application of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) promotes healing in experimentally-induced full-thickness skin wounds in animals. The hypothesis was that the adjunct of PRP has a positive effect on wound healing. An electronic search was carried out on the following databases: Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Research Gate, Cochrane Wounds Group, Veterinary Information Network. No publication date nor language restrictions were applied. Randomised and not randomised controlled clinical trials comparing PRP with placebo or with other treatments were included. The reduction of open wound area in PRP-treated (test) wounds compared to control wounds was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were healing time and number of healed cases in test group compared to control. The following effect sizes were calculated: the Hedges' g for continuous variables; the odds ratio for binary data. Eighteen controlled clinical trials were included in the qualitative and quantitative synthesis, with a total of 661 wounds. All studies were published in the period 2007-2016. Eight studies were carried out on rodent/lagomorph mammals and 10 on non-rodent/lagomorph mammals. In all included studies, control wounds underwent placebo or were left untreated. The PRP group showed a better healing performance than the control group in each outcome. The effect size was statistically significant considering the primary outcome and the overall aggregation of the three outcomes. The effect size, although in favour of the treatment with PRP, was not significant considering the healing time and the number of healings. The overall heterogeneity was mild or moderate. Five studies reported a high risk of selection bias. The publication bias was always mild or absent. The results support the hypothesis of the positive effects of the PRP when compared to control groups in the treatment of experimentally-induced full-thickness skin wounds in animals. PRP can therefore be considered an effective adjunctive therapy in stimulating second intention healing of acute wounds in healthy animals.},

As we are entering the post-antibiotic era, there is a growing need for identifying alternatives to antibiotics for prevention and treatment. Although phytotherapeutic remedies are available and are used in Europe, evidence of their efficacy is currently very limited but is nevertheless still necessary. A systematic review of phytotherapy used for the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases in farm animals has been conducted using the PICOS approach. Analysis and extraction of information from studies was performed according to a protocol, and included: publication year and source, research body, species, farming system, purpose of application, disease in focus, diagnostic method, remedy used (origin and ingredients of the remedy), producer of remedy, way of administration, study design, and control groups, measure of effect, and outcome of the study. A total of 1,705 papers were screened, but only 44 (comprising 53 independent studies) met the inclusion criteria. The majority of the scientific studies identified show limitations in the study design as well as in presentation and standardization of the botanical remedies studied, which limits the possibilities of drawing firm conclusions. Preventive effect was investigated in 89\% of the studies. Half of the studies reported uncertain effects of the botanical remedies on subclinical measures in comparison to a control group. The review highlights unresolved questions such as the need for standardized controlled trials and for improved standardization of the botanical products by analytical methods, such as high-performance liquid chromatography. It is necessary to consider this in order to achieve replicable outcomes and establish efficacy and safety of phytotherapy in farm practice. The manageability of alternative medicine in farm animals also warrants further investigation so as to ascertain whether all necessary preconditions for their use are being granted.},

The median detectable hazard ratio was 0.3 for overall survival and 0.06 for disease progression. Progressive disease thresholds for studies that did not adopt VCOG-RECIST guidelines varied in stringency. Additionally, there was significant underreporting across all Cochrane risk of bias categories. The proportion of studies with unclear reporting ranged from 44\% (randomization) to 94\% (selective reporting). 72\% of studies also failed to define a primary outcome.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have previously reported, in a systematic review of 181 studies, that restriction of antibiotic use in food-producing animals is associated with a reduction in antibiotic-resistant bacterial isolates. While informative, that report did not concretely specify whether different types of restriction are associated with differential effectiveness in reducing resistance. We undertook a sub-analysis of the systematic review to address this question. METHODS: We created a classification scheme of different approaches to antibiotic restriction: (1) complete restriction; (2) single antibiotic-class restriction; (3) single antibiotic restriction; (4) all non-therapeutic use restriction; (5) growth promoter and prophylaxis restriction; (6) growth promoter restriction and (7) other/undetermined. All studies in the original systematic review that were amenable to meta-analysis were included into this substudy and coded by intervention type. Meta-analyses were conducted using random effects models, stratified by intervention type. RESULTS: A total of 127 studies were included. The most frequently studied intervention type was complete restriction (n=51), followed by restriction of non-therapeutic (n=33) and growth promoter (n=19) indications. None examined growth promoter and prophylaxis restrictions together. Three and seven studies examined single antibiotic-class and single antibiotic restrictions, respectively; these two intervention types were not significantly associated with reductions in antibiotic resistance. Though complete restrictions were associated with a 15\% reduction in antibiotic resistance, less prohibitive approaches also demonstrated reduction in antibiotic resistance of 9\%-30\%. CONCLUSION: Broad interventions that restrict global antibiotic use appear to be more effective in reducing antibiotic resistance compared with restrictions that narrowly target one specific antibiotic or antibiotic class. Importantly, interventions that allow for therapeutic antibiotic use appear similarly effective compared with those that restrict all uses of antibiotics, suggesting that complete bans are not necessary. These findings directly inform the creation of specific policies to restrict antibiotic use in food-producing animals.},

The World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the World Organisation for Animal Health, known as the Tripartite Collaboration, have called for urgent action. We have previously published a systematic review of 181 studies, demonstrating that interventions that restrict antibiotic use in food-producing animals are associated with a reduction in antibiotic resistant bacterial isolates in both animals and humans. What remains unknown, however, are whether (and what) unintended consequences may arise from such interventions. We therefore undertook a sub-analysis of the original review to address this research question. A total of 47 studies described potential consequences of antibiotic restrictions. There were no consistent trends to suggest clear harm. There may be increased bacterial contamination of food products, the clinical significance of which remains unclear. There is a need for rigorous evaluation of the unintended consequences of antibiotic restrictions in human health, food availability, and economics, given their possible widespread implications.},

After removal of duplicate records; 612 publications were identified, of which 129 abstracts were screened for eligibility and 28 publications met criteria for inclusion in the review. Most studies were descriptive case series, cohort studies or non-randomised, uncontrolled field trials. Despite marked variation in study populations, case selection, diagnostic protocols, pergolide dose, follow-up period and outcome measures, in the vast majority of the included studies, pergolide was reported to provide overall clinical improvement in {\textgreater}75\% of cases. However, reported improvements in individual clinical signs varied widely.

Screening, data extraction and quality assessment of publications was undertaken by the authors using predefined criteria. Study design, methodology and information reported in included studies were assessed using Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) checklists. Risk of bias and applicability were appraised using the Quality Assessment tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) quality assessment tool. Due to identified biases and marked between-study variations, meta-analysis was not undertaken. After removal of duplicates, 415 publications were identified, of which 25 were evaluated in full, with 11 of these meeting inclusion criteria. In most studies, basal ACTH was reported to have good sensitivity (overall median 75.5\%; interquartile range [IQR], 64.0-86.5\%; range, 36.0-100\%) and excellent specificity (overall median, 95.2\%; IQR, 84.2-98.9\%; range, 63.3-100\%). However, QUADAS-2 and STARD assessment highlighted that studies did not utilise optimal study design and/or study populations for the evaluation of a diagnostic test and the majority were subject to bias, or provided insufficient information to fully assess possible biases. Based on this review, basal ACTH performed better at ruling out PPID than detecting it.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate mathematical models that predict mineral excretion, particularly calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and selenium (Se), from lactating dairy cows. Mineral excretion can be affected by several dietary factors. A deficiency in Ca or Mg application to pasture, among other factors, can contribute to grass tetany or wheat pasture poisoning in cows, whereas an excess can cause runoff into water supplies. Manure application with high Se concentration can also result in runoff, causing the bioaccumulation of selenium in aquatic ecosystems, wetland habitats and estuaries, leading to toxic levels in fish. A database composed of studies relating to mineral utilisation in lactating dairy cows conducted after and including the year 2000 was compiled. A meta-analysis was conducted with the aim of creating multiple empirical equations to predict Ca, Mg and Se excretion from lactating dairy cows. Calcium intake, feed Ca content, milk yield, milk protein content and acid detergent fibre content in diet were positively and linearly related to Ca excretion. Dietary crude protein content and milk fat content were negatively related to Ca excretion. Magnesium intake, feed Mg content and milk yield were positively and linearly related to Mg excretion. Selenium content of diet and dry matter intake were linearly and positively related to Se excretion. Two sets of models were developed using or excluding the intake variable and both sets of models were evaluated with independent data originating from commercial herd or individual animals. In general, intake measurements improved prediction when evaluated with independent datasets (root mean square prediction error=8\% to 19\% vs 14\% to 26\% of the average observed value). There were substantial mean biases, particularly those evaluated with data from a commercial farm, perhaps due to inaccurate feed intake measurements. Although there was generally good agreement between predicted and observed mineral excretion, model development and evaluation would benefit from an expanded database.},

	abstract = {Regarding preparing and serving foods, food handlers have an influential role in the spreading of foodborne infections. Due to the great potential to cause foodborne infections, intestinal parasites (IPs) are considered a significant public health problem in today's societies. In Iran, despite several regional reports, national data on IPs prevalence in food handlers are lacking. The aim of the present study, therefore, is to estimate the pooled prevalence of IPs infections and associated pooled odds ratio of educational level among food handlers in Iran. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar databases (international) and SID and Magiran databases (national) were systematically searched for studies that reporting the prevalence of IPs in food handlers in Iran, published between 2000 and 2020. Pooled prevalence was estimated using a random-effects model with a 95\% confidence interval (CI) and depicted as a forest plot, while heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochran's Q-test. The overall pooled prevalence estimate for IPs was 19.3\% (95\% CI = 14.9-23.7\%). Prevalence of the protozoan parasites (20\%, 95\% CI = 13.7-26.3\%) was significantly higher than that of the helminthic parasites (1.6\%, 95\% CI = 1.1-2.0\%). Giardia lamblia (5.2\%), Entamoeba coli (5.0\%), and Blastocystis spp. (4.4\%), as protozoan parasites, and Ascaris lumbricoides (1.4\%), Enterobius vermicularis (0.9\%), and Hymenolepis nana (0.5\%), as helminthic parasites, were the most commonly reported species. Food handlers with low educational levels were 20\% more exposed to IPs infection, compared to those with high educational levels (OR = 1.21, 95\% CI = 0.88 to 1.65). The prevalence of IPs infections among food handlers in Iran is significant. Besides taking into account this epidemiologic information, a holistic approach, including periodic stool screening, health education, and treatment of infected food handlers, will help in the control of these infections in Iran.},

PubMed, Science Direct, African Journals Online, and Google Scholar were used to search the articles. All references were screened and articles, which reported seroprevalence of bovine brucellosis in Ethiopia were included in the study. Meta-analysis using random-effects models was made to calculate the pooled seroprevalence of brucellosis. This review included 15 papers. The estimated pooled seroprevalence of brucellosis was found to be 3.0\% (95\% CI: 2.0, 4.0). The subgroup analysis showed that there was a statistically significant association between the disease and geographical location, setting, laboratory technique employed and study years. Also, there was some evidence of publication bias (Egger's test, p = 0.0003) on studies reporting the prevalence of brucellosis in Ethiopia. This review proves a high seroprevalence of brucellosis in the country and appropriate control strategies are recommended. Moreover, further study on the risk factors is also required to develop cost-effective preventive strategies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Campylobacter and Salmonella, particularly non-typhoidal Salmonella, are important bacterial enteric pathogens of humans which are often carried asymptomatically in animal reservoirs. Bacterial foodborne infections, including those derived from meat, are associated with illness and death globally but the burden is disproportionately high in Africa. Commercial meat production is increasing and intensifying in many African countries, creating opportunities and threats for food safety. METHODS: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched six databases for English language studies published through June 2016, that reported Campylobacter or Salmonella carriage or infection prevalence in food animals and contamination prevalence in food animal products from African countries. A random effects meta-analysis and multivariable logistic regression were used to estimate the species-specific prevalence of Salmonella and Campylobacter and assess relationships between sample type and region and the detection or isolation of either pathogen. RESULTS: Seventy-three studies reporting Campylobacter and 187 studies reporting Salmonella across 27 African countries were represented. Adjusted prevalence calculations estimate Campylobacter detection in 37.7\% (95\% CI 31.6-44.3) of 11,828 poultry samples; 24.6\% (95\% CI 18.0-32.7) of 1975 pig samples; 17.8\% (95\% CI 12.6-24.5) of 2907 goat samples; 12.6\% (95\% CI 8.4-18.5) of 2382 sheep samples; and 12.3\% (95\% CI 9.5-15.8) of 6545 cattle samples. Salmonella were detected in 13.9\% (95\% CI 11.7-16.4) of 25,430 poultry samples; 13.1\% (95\% CI 9.3-18.3) of 5467 pig samples; 9.3\% (95\% CI 7.2-12.1) of 2988 camel samples; 5.3\% (95\% CI 4.0-6.8) of 72,292 cattle samples; 4.8\% (95\% CI 3.6-6.3) of 11,335 sheep samples; and 3.4\% (95\% CI 2.2-5.2) of 4904 goat samples. 'External' samples (e.g. hide, feathers) were significantly more likely to be contaminated by both pathogens than 'gut' (e.g. faeces, cloaca) while meat and organs were significantly less likely to be contaminated than gut samples. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated widespread prevalence of Campylobacter species and Salmonella serovars in African food animals and meat, particularly in samples of poultry and pig origin. Source attribution studies could help ascertain which food animals are contributing to human campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis and direct potential food safety interventions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Studies have shown that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has a beneficial effect in the treatment of spinal cord injury. A meta-analysis was used to study the effect of DHA on the neurological recovery in the rat spinal cord injury model, and the relationship between the recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury and the time and method of administration and the dose of DHA. DATA SOURCE: Published studies on the effect of DHA on spinal cord injury animal models from seven databases were searched from their inception to January 2019, including PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, VIP, and SinoMed databases. The search terms included "spinal cord injury" "docosahexaenoic acid", and "rats". DATA SELECTION: Studies that evaluated the influence of DHA in rat models of spinal cord injury for locomotor functional recovery were included. The intervention group included any form of DHA treatment and the control group included treatment with normal saline, vehicle solution or no treatment. The Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation's risk of bias assessment tool was used for the quality assessment of the included studies. Literature inclusion, quality evaluation and data extraction were performed by two researchers. Meta-analysis was then conducted on all studies that met the inclusion criteria. Statistical analysis was performed on the data using RevMan 5.1.2. software. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the score on the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale. Secondary outcome measures were the sloping plate test, balance beam test, stair test and grid exploration test. RESULTS: A total of 12 related studies were included, 3 of which were of higher quality and the remaining 9 were of lower quality. The highest mean Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale score occurred at 42 days after DHA treatment in spinal cord injury rats. At 21 days after treatment, the mean difference in Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan scores between the DHA group and the control group was the most significant (pooled MD = 4.14; 95\% CI = 3.58-4.70; P {\textless} 0.00001). In the subgroup analysis, improvement in the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale score was more significant in rats administered DHA intravenously (pooled MD = 2.74; 95\% CI = 1.41-4.07; P {\textless} 0.0001) and subcutaneously (pooled MD = 2.99; 95\% CI = 2.29-3.69; P {\textless} 0.00001) than in the groups administered DHA orally (pooled MD = 3.04; 95\% CI = -1.01 to 7.09; P = 0.14). Intravenous injection of DHA at 250 nmol/kg (pooled MD = 2.94; 95\% CI = 2.47-3.41; P {\textless} 0.00001] and 1000 nmol/kg [pooled MD = 3.60; 95\% CI = 2.66-4.54; P {\textless} 0.00001) significantly improved the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale score in rats and promoted the recovery of motor function. CONCLUSION: DHA can promote motor functional recovery after spinal cord injury in rats. The administration of DHA by intravenous or subcutaneous injection is more effective than oral administration of DHA. Intravenous injection of DHA at doses of 250 nmol/kg or 1000 nmol/kg is beneficial. Because of the small number and the low quality of the included studies, more high-quality research is needed in future to substantiate the results.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Portal vein occlusion and associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy techniques are in the spotlight of oncological liver surgery. Research involving animal models is indispensable to study the mechanisms of liver regeneration. Inaccurate reporting acts as a significant barrier during the correct interpretation of preclinical findings. Hence, we performed a systematic review to evaluate the status quo of the reporting standards and to assess the potential factors influencing reporting in animal studies, which are focusing on portal vein occlusion and/or associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was performed in the PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases. Baseline study characteristics were recorded, and quality assessment was performed using the Animals in Research: Reporting in vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) checklist. RESULTS: A total of 107 research articles were included for the comprehensive assessment. In the subgroup analysis, newer reports and studies from the post-ARRIVE era, and reports from Europe were all associated with significantly higher ARRIVE scores (P {\textless} 0.05). Univariable regression analysis confirmed these factors as predictors of higher reporting quality. However, in the multivariable analysis, only publishing in the post-ARRIVE era has been found as single independent predictor of higher reporting standards (P = 0.028 post-ARRIVE total score 75th percentile; P = 0.000 post-ARRIVE total score median). CONCLUSIONS: Although an improving trend has been observed in reporting quality over the past years, this effect was clearly insufficient. Our results emphasize the need for further measures to improve the methodical quality at all levels of planning, execution, and reporting of preclinical studies in liver regeneration research.},

The infection occurs through ingestion of contaminated food or water, and direct contact with feces of infected animal or human. Regardless of few local reports of Campylobacter and its antimicrobial susceptibility profile, there is no comprehensive data that show the burden of Campylobacter infection at national level in Ethiopia. This systemic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the pooled prevalence of Campylobacter and its resistance patterns in Ethiopia from different sources. Method: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Google scholar, Science direct and Google engine search was conducted for studies published from 2000 to July 30, 2020 on prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Campylobacter in human, animal and food. The study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Checklist. Data from articles was extracted using a standardized data extraction format. The quality of the studies was assessed based on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The Q test and I$^{\textrm{2}}$ test statistic were used to test heterogeneity across studies. The Pooled estimate of prevalence of Campylobacter species and its antimicrobial susceptibility profile was computed by a random effects model using STATA 16.0 software. Results were presented in forest plot, tables, funnel plot and figures with 95\% confidence interval.},

The aim of the present work was to assess the effect of probiotic addition on shrimp survival and growth performance through meta-analysis. PubMed, SciELO and Google Scholar search engines were searched for relevant studies published from 1980 to 2017 without language exclusion. We only selected the experiments from articles using penaeid shrimps without apparent disease, with the results published in peer-reviewed journals with any dispersion measure. Survival, specific growth rate (SGR) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were selected as outcomes. We evaluated experimental design, penaeid shrimp species, larval or postlarval stage, probiotic strain, modes of administration among others. A total of 100, 60 and 49 experiments were included to assess probiotic effects on survival, SGR and FCR, respectively. Probiotics increased survival compared to controls (SMD=3.068, 95\% CI 2.594 to 3.543) and improved SGR (SMD=3.811, 95\% CI 3.269 to 4.354) and FCR (SMD=-3.194, 95\% CI -3.469 to -2.920) in the pooled standardized mean difference random effect model, considering the source of heterogeneity and publication biases (i.e. where the decision to publish or not depends on the outcome of the experiment, e.g. withhold negative outcomes). Survival, SGR and FCR were improved in shrimps treated with probiotic. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a meta-analysis designed to investigate the effects of probiotics on shrimp survival and growth performance.},

	abstract = {1. Divergence in outcomes from studies on the effects of litter materials on body weight, feed intake, feed conversion and mortality in broilers has led to a need for a meta-analysis to quantify their effects.2. A systematic search of published quantitative research relating to wood shavings and alternative bedding litters was conducted using databases.3. Means, standard deviations and sample sizes were extracted from each study. The response variables were analysed using the standardised mean difference (SMD, control treatment minus alternative litters).4. The literature demonstrated that alternative materials have no impact on feed intake in broilers, compared to wood shavings (SMD = 0.064, 95\% CI = -0.101-0.229, P = 0.44).5. There was a positive overall effect of wood shavings on body weight (SMD = 0.253, 95\% CI = 0.073-0.433, P = 0.006), feed conversion (SMD = -0.169, 95\% CI = -0.327 - -0.012, P = 0.03) and mortality (SMD = -1.069, 95\% CI = -1.983 - -0.155, P = 0.02) of broilers, compared to other litter types.6. Subgroup meta-analysis revealed that straw, when used as an alternative litter material to wood shavings, may be responsible for lower body weight (SMD = 0.654, 95\% CI = 0.162-1.146, P = 0.009), worse feed conversion (SMD = -0.487, 95\% CI = -0.828 - -0.145, P = 0.005) and higher mortality rates of broilers (SMD = -3.25, 95\% CI = -5.681 - -0.819, P = 0.009). Rice husks impaired body weight compared to wood shavings (SMD = 0.535, 95\% CI = 0.065-1.004, P = 0.02).7. It was concluded that different litter types do not affect the broilers' feed intake. Conversely, broilers kept on straw showed lower body weights, worse feed conversion and higher mortality rates, in comparison to wood shavings. Rice husks decreased body weight compared to wood shavings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The zoonotic parasite Taenia saginata transmits between humans, the definitive host (causing taeniosis), and bovines as the intermediate host (causing cysticercosis). Central and western Asia and the Caucasus have large cattle populations and beef consumption is widespread. However, an overview of the extent of human T. saginata infection and bovine cysticercosis is lacking. This review aims to summarize the distribution of T. saginata in this region. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted, that gathered published and grey literature, and official data concerning T. saginata taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis in central and western Asia and the Caucasus published between January 1st, 1990 and December 31st, 2018. Where no data were available for a country within this period, published data from 1985-1990 were also accessed. RESULTS: From 10,786 articles initially scanned, we retrieved 98 full-text articles from which data were extracted. In addition, two unpublished datasets were provided on the incidence of human taeniosis. Data for human taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis were found for all countries except Turkmenistan. Human taeniosis prevalence varied from undetected to over 5.3\%, with regional variations. Where bovine cysticercosis was detected, prevalences varied from case reports to 25\%. CONCLUSIONS: The public health burden of T. saginata is assumed to be small as the parasite is of low pathogenicity to humans. However, this review indicates that infection continues to be widespread and this may result in a large economic burden, due to the resources utilized in meat inspection and condemnation or processing with subsequent downgrading of infected carcasses.},

Most of the in vivo studies did not include data that would allow exclusion of bias risks, according to SYRCLE's risk of bias tool. Both in vitro and in vivo data suggest anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative actions of resveratrol in models of diabetic retinopathy.

The lack of quantitative studies analysing these physiological changes from a comparative perspective limits our ability to explain and understand these adaptations. Herein, we present our meta-analysis of studies reporting changes in bone turnover and calcium homeostasis during pregnancy and lactation in 14 species of mammals. Our meta-analysis of 60 studies showed that all species have a similar pattern of physiological changes during pregnancy and lactation, which include: (1) decreased serum calcium concentrations; (2) bone tissue loss; (3) decreased serum calcitonin and parathyroid hormone concentrations; and (4) increased serum calcitriol concentration, regardless of changes in parathyroid hormone concentrations. In addition, we found a negative relationship between: (1) serum calcium concentrations and the number of teats; and (2) serum parathyroid hormone concentrations and litter mass.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted to elucidate the factors affecting drinking water intake (DWI) in order to develop new DWI empricial predictive models for lactating dairy cows and to compare with existing models. A large dataset, containing 262 experimental diets from 75 experiments published in 65 peer-reviewed papers was built. Selected explanatory variables were grouped into animal (body weight (BW); BW$^{\textrm{0.75}}$; milk yield), diet composition (dry matter; ash; sodium; potassium; crude protein (CP); neutral detergent fiber), dry matter intake (DMI) and environment (mean air temperature and relative humidity) inputs. To develop the predictive models, the dataset (peer-reviewed papers) was randomly divided into two subsets for statistical analyses. The first data subset was used to develop equations to predict DWI (41 peer-reviewed papers; 47 experiments; 157 experimental diets), and the second data subset was used to assess the adequacy of the predictive models (24 peer-reviewed papers; 28 experiments; 105 experimental diets). Ash was the main diet input affecting DWI in lactating dairy cows, while BW$^{\textrm{0.75}}$ affected DWI more than milk yield. Use of dietary characteristics (DM, ash and CP) and DMI as inputs could be enough to predict DWI as accurately as more complete models. Dry matter intake as predictive variable does not improve DWI prediction in models with only animal (BW$^{\textrm{0.75}}$ and milk yield) as input, but it substantially improves prediction of models without use of animal as input. Among the existing models evaluated, those developed from just one experiment (Castle and Thomas, 1975; Little and Shaw, 1978; Murphy et al., 1983; Stockdale and King, 1983; Dahlborn et al., 1998) had poor prediction quality. We proposed the use of two models (diet II and animal+diet models) that presented the lowest root mean square prediction error (RMSPE) to predict DWI in lactating dairy cows.},

However, inconsistent results are found in the literature. Ingredient composition of the diets is one of the most important sources of variation that may affect enzyme efficacy and consistency of results. A systematic review and a meta-analysis was therefore conducted to determine which exogenous enzymes with which diet type most consistently improve pig growth, nutrient digestibility and feed efficiency. Enzyme type and dietary cereal source were the main explanatory variables included in the models. The mean difference effects of enzyme supplementation on average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), gain to feed (G:F), apparent ileal digestibility (AiD) and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), and gross energy (GE) were calculated for each study and these were used as the effect size estimates in the meta-analysis. A dataset with 139 comparisons from 67 peer-reviewed publications was used in the meta-analysis. In response to enzyme supplementation, G:F was improved in 38 of the 120 comparisons reporting pig growth data, remained un-changed in 78 and deteriorated in 4. Overall, DM and GE AiD, and ATTD were improved by xylanase, xylanase+beta-glucanase, mannanase and protease dietary supplementation (P{\textless}0.05). Crude protein AiD was only improved by protease dietary supplementation (P{\textless}0.001). Dietary supplementation with xylanase alone improved ADG of maize - (P{\textless}0.05) and co-product - (P{\textless}0.05) based diets but had no effect on the G:F of grow-finisher pigs. Dietary supplementation with xylanase+beta-glucanase had no effect on ADG, ADFI and G:F. Protease supplementation tended to improve the ADG of grow-finisher pigs fed co-product-based diets (P=0.08) but had no effect on G:F. Dietary supplementation with multi-enzyme complexes improved the ADG (P{\textless}0.05) and G:F (P{\textless}0.01) of maize-, wheat-, barley- and co-product-based diets. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with all enzyme types improved nutrient digestibility depending on ingredient content, while mannanase and multi-enzyme complex supplementation most consistently improved growth and feed efficiency.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Consumption of lean fish and fish-derived proteins were effective for improving lipid profiles in published studies; however, evidence remains inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of lean fish or fish-derived protein on serum/plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels by conducting a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials (RCTs). DATA SOURCES: Medline (Ovid), Scopus, CINAHL, and Food and Nutritional Sciences databases were searched from the start date of each database to September 2019 to identify RCTs determining the effect of lean fish on lipid profile. STUDY SELECTION INCLUDED: RCTs investigated lean fish and fish-derived proteins intake and determined at least 1 major lipid or lipoprotein measurement. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently evaluated 1217 studies against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Relevant studies were assessed for risks of bias, and random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to generate average estimates of effect. RESULTS: A total of 24 studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of data from 18 to 21 eligible crossover and parallel-design RCTs with a total of 1392 to 1456 participants found triacylglycerol-lowering effects for lean fish compared with no fish consumption. Lean fish intake showed no significant differences related to total cholesterol or lipoprotein levels. Subanalysis showed that parallel-group RCTs tended to find greater reduction effects on circulating triacylglycerol than did crossover RCTs. CONCLUSION: Additional better-designed, longer, and larger RCTs, particularly crossover RCTs, are needed to clarify the impact of lean fish and fish proteins on the serum/plasma lipid profile. Findings from such studies would enable practitioners to provide their patients evidence-based recommendations to meet the American Heart Association guidelines for fish consumption to reduce cardiovascular disease risk.},

	abstract = {The global climate change brings about myriad of changes in the environment and ecosystem. The sea-level rise due to climate change results in salt-water intrusion into freshwater reservoirs of the coastal areas, increasing the salinity of the natural sources of potable water. People in the coastal areas consume saline water, exposing the intestinal tract to higher salt concentration on regular basis. This meta-analysis attempts to relate consumption of saline water to dysbiosis of rodent gut microbiome. Scientific reports were searched in PubMed/Medline, the Cochrane Library and Google Scholar. Original articles, abstracts and short communications were included depending on predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. A total of 8 original reports involving 124 rodents were included in this study. The pooled specificity and sensitivity of the reports were found to be 0.833 and 0.891 respectively by Meta Disc software v1.4. Pooled odds ratio and AUC were 20.056 and 0.896 respectively, implying a correlation between increased salt intake and gut microbiome dysbiosis (imbalance), measured from altered Firmicutes: Bacteroidetes ratio. Microbiome dysbiosis makes the intestine prone to enteric diseases. The outcomes of this meta-analysis indicates the dependence of mammalian gut microbiome on the amount of salt ingested, a condition aggravated by the global climate change and therefore necessitates similar studies on human populations living on coastal areas.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medicinal plants have been used traditionally since centuries for wound care and treatment of skin diseases both in human and animals. Skin diseases are one of the most common reasons for owners to take their dog to the veterinarian. The demands for treatment and prophylaxis of these diseases are broad. A wide range of bacteria including antibiotic-resistant bacteria can be involved, making the treatment challenging and bear an anthropo-zoonotic potential. The aim of this review is to systematically evaluate based on recent scientific literature, the potential of four medicinal plants to enrich the therapeutic options in pyoderma, canine atopic dermatitis, otitis externa, wounds and dermatophytosis in dogs. RESULTS: Based on four books and a survey among veterinarians specialized in phytotherapy, four medicinal plants were chosen as the subject of this systematic review: Calendula officinalis L. (Marigold), Hypericum perforatum L. agg. (St. John's Wort), Matricaria chamomilla L. (syn. Matricaria recutita L., Chamomile) and Salvia officinalis L. (Sage). According to the PRISMA statement through literature research on two online databases a total of 8295 publications was screened and narrowed down to a final 138 publications for which full-text documents were analyzed for its content resulting in a total of 145 references (21 clinical, 24 in vivo and 100 in vitro references). CONCLUSIONS: All four plants were proven to have antibacterial and antifungal effects of a rather broad spectrum including antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This makes them an interesting new option for the treatment of pyoderma, otitis externa, infected wounds and dermatophytosis. Marigold, St. John's Wort and Chamomile showed wound-healing properties and are thus promising candidates in line to fill the therapeutic gap in canine wound-healing agents. St. John's Wort and Chamomile also showed anti-inflammatory and other beneficial effects on healthy skin. Due to the wide range of beneficial effects of these medicinal plants, they should be taken into account for the treatment of dermatologic diseases in dogs at least in future clinical research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Taenia solium and Taenia saginata are food-borne parasites of global importance. In eastern Europe only fragmented information is available on the epidemiology of these zoonotic parasites in humans and animal populations. In particular for T. solium, on-going transmission is suspected. The aim of this systematic review was to collect the available data and describe the current knowledge on the epidemiology of T. solium and T. saginata in eastern Europe. METHODS: Literature published in international databases from 1990 to 2017 was systematically reviewed. Furthermore, local sources and unpublished data from national databases were retrieved from local eastern European experts. The study area included 22 countries. RESULTS: Researchers from 18 out of the 22 countries provided data from local and unpublished sources, while no contacts could be established with researchers from Belarus, Kosovo, Malta and Ukraine. Taeniosis and human cysticercosis cases were reported in 14 and 15 out of the 22 countries, respectively. Estonia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia reported cases of porcine cysticercosis. Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Ukraine reported bovine cysticercosis. CONCLUSIONS: There is indication that taeniosis and cysticercosis are present across eastern Europe but information on the occurrence of T. solium and T. saginata across the region remains incomplete. Available data are scarce and species identification is in most cases absent. Given the public health impact of T. solium and the potential economic and trade implications due to T. saginata, notification of taeniosis and human cysticercosis should be implemented and surveillance and notification systems in animals should be improved.},

	doi = {10.15167/2421-4248/jpmh2019.60.2.891},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Trichinellosis is a worldwide zooantroponosis caused by a nematode of the genus Trichinella that can pose a risk to human health. Among the species of Trichinella, T. Spiralis is the most common represented. The main source of human infection is the consumption of raw or undercooked meat (especially from pigs, wild boars and horses). Infection with Trichinella was one of the most frequent parasitic diseases in Italy until 1959 when obligatory screening for these parasites in slaughtered swines was introduced. As the last review on this topic was performed in 1989, the aim of our study was to describe the epidemiology of Trichinellosis in Italy from 1989 to 2017. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a systematic research in Pubmed (MEDLINE). METHODS: We included in our review studies that were published in the peer reviewed literature using the MESH terms "Trichinellosis" and "Italy". The only restrictions were the language (articles should be in English, Italian, Spanish or French) and the date of publication: from 1989 to March 2017. We excluded all the articles which referred to trichinellosis in the animals or which focused only on molecular biology of trichinella or on diagnostic techniques. RESULTS: We found 56 studies, but only 8 were considered eligible. During the study period, 764 cases of Trichinellosis occurred in Italy: 13.7\% caused by T. Britovi and 84.4\% by T. spiralis; in 14 cases the identification of the parasite was not performed. The outbreaks occurred in Umbria, Piedmont, Apulia (500 cases in 1990, by T. spiralis), Basilicata, Tuscany, Abruzzo, Emilia Romagna, Sardinia. In 2001 and in 2008 two outbreaks occurred in Lazio and Veneto respectively, but imported from abroad. The most important sources of infections were: horse meat (82.2\%); wild boar meat (11.9\%); pig meat (5.9\%). CONCLUSIONS: Trichinellosis is still present in Italy, but often forgotten by general practitioners and infectious diseases specialists. It's pivotal to improve awareness about this parasitic disease in Physicians and veterinarians. A strict surveillance, especially on meat products from endemic countries or from wild animals is necessary to considerably reduce the risk of acquiring the infection.},

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of Equine-Assisted Activities and Therapies (EAAT) in ASD patients based on a review of the literature. METHODS: A review of the literature and a meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PUBMED, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and PEDro databases were searched until July 20, 2017. Only articles published in English, in a journal with a review process, after 1999, with a control group or presentation of comparative pre-/post-therapy results in ASD patients, and clear inclusion/exclusion criteria were considered. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies (QATQS).The meta-analysis of three studies was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies with 390 participants (aged: 3-16 years) were included. The interaction between psychosocial functioning and EAAT was investigated in most studies. Improvement was reported in the following domains: socialization, engagement, maladaptive behaviors, and shorter reaction time in problem-solving situations after EAAT. The meta-analysis revealed no statistically significant differences for the investigated effects. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the need for further, more standardized research, the results of the studies included in this review allow us to conclude that EAAT may be a useful form of therapy in children with ASD.},

	abstract = {AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess the effects of the available coating methods against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) biofilm development on titanium implants. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases until May 18, 2019, for studies that used animal models of infections to evaluate various titanium implant coating methods to prevent S. aureus infection. Twenty-seven studies were eligible for inclusion in qualitative synthesis. Of those, twenty-three were considered in pair-wise meta-analysis. In addition, subgroup analysis of implant protection strategies relative to uncoated controls was performed, and any adverse events stemming from the coating applications were reported. Quality assessment was performed using SYRCLE's risk of bias tool for animal studies. RESULTS: Meta-analysis showed that active coating with antibiotics was favoured over uncoated controls (standardised mean differences [SMD] for MRSA and MSSA were - 2.71 [95\% CI, - 4.24 to - 1.18], p = 0.0005, and - 2.5 [- 3.79 to - 1.22], p = 0.0001, respectively). Likewise, large effect sizes were demonstrated when a combination of active and conventional non-degradable passive coatings was compared with controls (SMDs for MRSA and MSSA were - 0.62 [95\% CI, - 1.15 to - 0.08], p = 0.02, and - 1.93 [95\% CI, - 2.87 to - 0.98], p {\textless} 0.001, respectively). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: As a standalone prevention method, active titanium coating with antibiotics yielded promising results against both MSSA and MRSA. Combinations between active and non-degradable passive coatings, potentially allowing for sustained antimicrobial substance release, provided consistent hardware infection protection. Thus, we recommend that future research efforts focus on combined coating modalities against S. aureus biofilm infections in the presence of titanium implants.

We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis of standardized mean differences (SMD) with subgroup analysis linked to various protection strategies and we recorded complications. Quality was assessed with the SYRCLE's risk of bias tool. Twenty-five studies were included. Combined active coating (featuring organic antibacterial compound release) and degradable passive finishing (lipid- or polymer-based structure modification reducing bacterial adhesion) was favored over untreated controls (SMDs for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus [MSSA] and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] were -3.46, 95\% CI [-4.53 to -2.4], p {\textless} .001 [n = 4 head-to-head comparisons]; and -6.67, 95\% CI [-10.53 to -3], p {\textless} .001 [n = 5 head-to-head comparisons], respectively). Systemic vitamin D supplementation and systemic antibiotic administration with or without local antibiotics demonstrated favorable outcomes against MSSA infection. On the contrary, no benefit was seen following vaccination. Of note, no side effects were documented. On the basis of data gathered from eight studies, which comprised 294 animals, a bioresorbable polymer- or lipid-based surface modification supplemented with organic coating yielded improved infection-related outcomes against MSSA and MRSA stainless steel infections, and therefore, this strategy could be further investigated in human research.},

	abstract = {Background: There has been increased concern about the suitability of CO(2) as a method for euthanasia of laboratory mice and rats, including the potential discomfort, pain or distress that animals may experience prior to loss of consciousness; time to loss of consciousness; best methods for use of CO(2); and the availability of better alternatives. These discussions have been useful in providing new information, but have resulted in significant confusion regarding the acceptability of CO(2) for rodent euthanasia. In some cases, researchers and veterinarians have become uncertain as to which techniques to recommend or use for euthanasia of laboratory mice and rats. Methods: The International Association of Colleges of Laboratory Animal Medicine (IACLAM) convened a taskforce to examine the evidence for adverse welfare indicators in laboratory rats and mice undergoing CO(2) euthanasia using a SYRCLE-registered systematic review protocol. Of 3,772 papers identified through a database search (PubMed, Web of Science, CAB Direct, Agricola, and grey literature) from 1900 to 2017, 37 studies were identified for detailed review (some including more than one species or age group), including 15 in adult mice, 21 in adult rats, and 5 in neonates of both species. Experiments or reports were excluded if they only assessed parameters other than those directly affecting animal welfare during CO(2) induction and/or euthanasia. Results: Study design and outcome measures were highly variable and there was an unclear to high risk of bias in many of the published studies. Changes in the outcome measures evaluated were inconsistent or poorly differentiated. It is likely that repeated exposures to carbon dioxide inhalation are aversive to adult rats and mice, based on avoidance behavior studies; however, this effect is largely indistinguishable from aversion induced by repeated exposures to other inhalant anesthetic gasses. Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence to permit an unbiased assessment of the effect of CO(2) inhalation during euthanasia on welfare indicators in laboratory mice and rats. Additional well-designed, unbiased, and adequately powered studies are needed to accurately assess the welfare of laboratory mice and rats undergoing euthanasia via CO(2) gas.},

	abstract = {Milk and dairy products contribute ≤14\% of the caloric intake in developed countries. Recent evidence has shown controversial results with regard to the role of dairy products in deleterious processes such as inflammation. The increasing number of studies on the anti- and proinflammatory effects of milk and dairy products in the past 5 y reflects the growing interest in this area of research. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the scientific evidence provided in the past 5 y on the effects of milk and dairy products on inflammatory biomarkers provided by randomized clinical trials. The search strategy was conducted in Medline (via PubMed) and Scopus (which includes EMBASE and the Web of Science) databases and included articles from 1 January 2012 to 30 April 2018. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane methodology. The number of study participants, type of study, doses, and the key results are reported. The following primary outcomes were considered for inclusion: circulating concentrations of C-reactive protein, interleukins, cytokines, and vascular adhesion molecules or expression of proinflammatory genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells; however, the primary outcomes considered were not limited to these. Sixteen studies (15 articles) included in this systematic review reported on healthy individuals and subjects who were overweight or obese and who had metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes. The consumption of milk or dairy products did not show a proinflammatory effect in healthy subjects or individuals with metabolic abnormalities. The majority of studies documented a significant anti-inflammatory effect in both healthy and metabolically abnormal subjects, although not all the articles were of high quality.

	abstract = {Human alveolar echinococcosis (AE), caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis, is one of the most dangerous zoonoses in the Northern hemisphere. In Europe, the parasite's life cycle is sylvatic, involving small rodents as intermediate hosts and red foxes as the major definitive hosts. Given the severity of this disease in humans and the high levels of environmental contamination with E. multilocularis in endemic areas, it seems crucial to implement control measures in order to prevent human AE. This systematic review identifies previous anthelmintic control programs targeting E. multilocularis in wild and domestic carnivores and evaluates the effectiveness of the different strategies implemented. A search through six databases identified 302 scientific papers for the period 1950-2015, of which only 17 were retained according to the inclusion criteria set. These 17 papers focused on control of E. multilocularis by baiting foxes in highly endemic areas of Europe or Japan, with the exception of one study focused on dogs in Alaska. The papers highlighted differences in baiting types, baiting frequency, choice of control areas and length of treatment period. Overall, these studies resulted in a sharp and statistically significant decrease in parasite prevalence, confirmed by the absence of overlap between confidence intervals for the pooled risk differences of control and treated areas. A monthly baiting frequency was proven to be highly effective at decreasing E. multilocularis prevalence in foxes, even in highly endemic areas and in a short period of time. Nevertheless, when foxes were not fully dewormed, the parasite showed a strong capacity to rapidly recover its initial prevalence. The fox baiting approach appears to be the most useful method for controlling the sylvatic life cycle of E. multilocularis, but it require a cost/benefit analysis before it is likely to be accepted by stakeholders.},

	abstract = {Consumption of specific fatty acids (FA) that are synthesized in the mammary gland, namely de novo FA, has implications for human health. The objective of the present meta-analysis was to study the associations between milk fat content of de novo FA, with (1) diet composition, and (2) milk production and composition. Milk FA data from 96 peer-reviewed studies published between 1990 and 2016 that included 324 treatment means from 83 bovine experiments, 36 treatment means from 12 caprine experiments, and 40 treatment means from 12 ovine experiments were used in this analysis. Individual species models including the fixed effect of experiment were fitted using multiple regression to explain milk content of de novo FA as a function of diet composition and milk production and composition variables. We also evaluated replacing the effect of the experiment by the effect of the experiment nested in the laboratory at which the research had been conducted, and the effect of the laboratory. Butyric acid content in milk fat was positively but weakly related to dietary ether extract in does and ewes. Lauric, myristic, and palmitic acid contents in milk fat were negatively related to dietary ether extract in does and to a somewhat lesser extent in cows and ewes. The results confirm that the inclusion of lipids in the diet may not only affect the availability of preformed FA but also the profile of FA synthesized de novo in the mammary gland. Most of the variation in all prediction models was explained by the experiment or by the laboratory if the latter was included in the model. The ample variation in analytical methods reported by the different research groups suggests that differences in analytical protocols might explain a substantial proportion of the variation in de novo FA profile. A main conclusion of this study is the potential influence of differences in analytical procedures to explain the variation in de novo FA profile. Standardization of methods of FA analysis to improve reproducibility seems to be an aspect of importance to this area of research.},

Molds and their toxins have attracted much attention worldwide due to the important economic losses related to their effects on human health and domestic and international trade. Although more than 400 mycotoxins have been identified, most studies have focused on aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, fusarium toxins, zearalenone, patulin, and trichothecenes owing to their relationships with food safety and economic losses. In Turkey, the dramatic variations in climatic conditions among regions have facilitated the spread of various foodborne mycotoxins. Accordingly, in this systematic review, a summary of the occurrence and contamination levels of foodborne mycotoxins in Turkey was provided. Based on the literature review, mycotoxin levels were shown to exceed the limits designated by the European Union in apple juice (35\%), milk (21\%), dairy products (12\%), dried fruits and vegetables (11\%), herbs (10\%), cereal and cereal products (2\%), nuts (1\%), and feeds (1\%). Thus, there is a need for additional studies on the mycotoxin prevalence in all types of foods and feeds throughout Turkey, and education programs on mycotoxin management are important for reducing the prevalence of mycotoxin contamination.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture is currently one of the best prospects to help meet the growing need for protein in the human diet. However, aquaculture development and production result in consequences for the environment and also impact other productive activities. Salmon and trout cage culture has required the use of large quantities of pharmaceuticals in order to control outbreaks and the persistence of different pathogens, including sea lice (parasitic copepods), which cause economic losses of around 0.39 € Kg(-1) of salmon produced. The pharmaceuticals currently used for the control of sea lice (cypermethrin, deltamethrin, azamethiphos, hydrogen peroxide) are applied by in situ immersion treatments, enclosing net pens using tarpaulin and then bathing fish with the pharmaceutical. After treatment the pharmaceuticals are released into the surrounding environment, exposing non-target species. Although the effects of such pharmaceutical exposure has been studied in some species, to date a systematic and exhaustive review of these potential effects has not yet been performed. In this study, an exhaustive review of the literature evaluating lethal and sub-lethal effects of anti-sea lice pharmaceuticals on non-target crustaceans and bivalves was performed, in order to assess the extent of the effects, toxicity, variables affecting such toxicity and identify potential synergistic effects previously unexplored. Our results show clear negative effects at concentrations lower than those used in treatments against sea lice in all of the species studied. Likewise, this study demonstrates knowledge gaps that need to be addressed in order to improve our understanding of the effects of these pharmaceuticals on non-target species, ecosystems in general and other productive activities.},

Eight definitive articles were considered for the presentation of results and discussion (seven published in English and one in Spanish, between 1993 and 2019). From the information collected in the eight studies, it can be inferred that the response to treatment depends on the underlying disease, but that when a more chronic process occurs, it is difficult for the patient to respond to the management protocol, since bronchiectasis has no cure, and it is only possible, from the treatment, to delay its progression.},

	abstract = {Learning anatomy traditionally has depended on traditional techniques like human cadaveric dissection and the use of textbooks. As technology advances at an ever-rapid speed, there are revolutionary ways to learn anatomy. A number of technologies, techniques and methodologies are utilised in anatomical education, but ones specifically receiving a lot of interest and traction is that of augmented reality and virtual reality. Although there has been a surge in interest in the use of these technologies, the literature is sparse in terms of its evaluation as to the effectiveness of such tools. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine in greater detail the literature specifically to see what the best practice in this field could be. By undertaking a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched for articles in both Web of Science and PubMed. Using the terms "augmented reality and teaching anatomy" yielded 88 articles. We then used "virtual reality and teaching anatomy" which resulted in 200 articles. We examined these articles, including that on augmented reality and virtual reality used to teach anatomy to undergraduate and postgraduate students, residents, dentistry, nursing and veterinary students. Articles were excluded if they were systematic reviews, literature reviews, review articles, news articles, articles not written in English and any literature that presented how a virtual model was created without the evidence of students testing it. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for virtual reality were the same as augmented reality. In addition, we examined the articles to identify if they contained data which was quantitative, qualitative or both. The articles were further separated into those which were pro, neutral or against for the use of these digital technologies. Of the 288 articles, duplicate articles totalling 67 were removed and 134 articles were excluded according to our exclusion criteria. Of the 31 articles related to augmented reality, 30 were pro, one neutral and no articles against the use of this technology. Fifty-six articles related to virtual reality were categorised resulted in 45 pro, eight neutral and three against the use of this technology. Overall, the results indicate most articles identified related to both virtual and augmented reality were for the use of those technologies, than neutral or against. This systemic review highlights the recent advances of both augmented reality and virtual reality to implementing the technology into the anatomy course.},

We used an existing tourism classification schema to categorise each article based on the situation reported, with the new addition of one context. We classified 92 separate animal reports in 46 articles into four (of six possible) contexts: mammals as attractions (n = 40 animal reports), mammals as commodities (n = 33), mammals as threats (n = 2), and unusual sightings of mammals (n = 17). Shortage of food, in danger of losing home, having an enriched/relaxed environment, spatial expansion, disease transmission, and poaching are the major impacts or events reported in these contexts.We suggest changes for each context with respect to how people interface with mammals, with the goal of improving the lives of mammals and the people dependent on them.},

However, in the literature, different positivity classifications/scoring were used in the evaluation of HER-2 status, and there is no consensus in terms of scoring of HER-2 expression in canine mammary tumors. In this study, it was aimed to estimate the HER-2 positivity rate by evaluating the results of the study using different positivity classifications by meta-analysis. In this context, by using "HER-2 canine mammary tumor" keywords, Pubmed and Web of Science electronic databases were scanned until February 2019, and a total of 97 related studies were found. However, 20 of these studies were used for the analysis. Two different meta-analyses were performed to evaluate the HER-2 positivity status with "2+ and 3+" and "3+" scores. As a result, HER-2 positivity rates were determined at 25.87\% and 25.99\% for the studies using "2+/3+" scores and "3+" respectively for HER-2 positivity. Therefore, this result suggests that the rate of HER-2 positivity is similar between humans and dogs.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to systematically review and critically analyze the published data of in vitro studies testing the effect of root canal sealers on the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed by using the Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Open Grey databases. A hand search of the reference lists of identified articles was also performed. Two reviewers critically assessed the studies for eligibility against inclusion and exclusion criteria and performed data extraction. Evaluation of the risk of bias of the studies was performed. RESULTS: A total of 48 studies were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 20 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. All studies had a medium or high risk of bias. Although the majority of the studies reported that the use of root canal sealers increased the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth, conflicting evidence was found for the reinforcing effect of resin, glass ionomer, and calcium silicate-based sealers while there was moderate evidence for zinc oxide eugenol-based sealers in favor of no reinforcing effect. CONCLUSION: On the basis of available evidence, the use of root canal sealer increases the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth. However, included studies presented considerable risk of bias. Regarding the comparisons among the sealers, no conclusions could be drawn for the superiority of one sealer type to another. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A considerable heterogeneity was found in the methodologies of included studies. Therefore, this review strongly suggests the development of standardized methods to test the reinforcement effect of root canal filling materials in in vitro studies.},

Therefore, this systematic and meta-analytic study was conducted to determine the prevalence of cystic echinococcosis in slaughtered livestock in Iran. METHODS: The present study was conducted as a systematic review and meta-analysis. The SID \& Magiran, MEDLINE (PubMed), ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were searched with a view to selecting relevant research works. As a result, 31 articles published from April 1970 to April 2020 were selected. The heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using the I(2) index. Data analysis was conducted within the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (CMA) v.3.0 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA) and Arc map (ArcGIS 10.3) software. RESULTS: The heterogeneity of the studies was evaluated using the I(2) test which value was 99\% showing a high heterogeneity in the studies. The results of publication bias in studies were evaluated by the Egger test, which were not statistically significant (P = 0.144). The overall prevalence of cystic echinococcosis in slaughtered livestock in Iran is 13.9\% (95\%CI: 10.7-17.7\%). The results of the meta-regression analysis indicate the increasing trend of the hydatid cyst prevalence with the increase of sample size and publication year (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study and the relatively high prevalence of cystic echinococcosis in slaughtered livestock in Iran, health policy makers should make effective decisions in this regard, and implement careful inspections and interventions by experts and health authorities.},

	abstract = {Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease. Despite ongoing improvements in the initial surgical repair, there are lingering concerns regarding the long-term outcomes that may be complicated by right ventricular dysfunction, right ventricular dyssynchrony, and sudden cardiac death. The mechanisms leading to these late complications remain incompletely understood. Experimental animal models have been developed as preclinical steps to gain better insight into the pathophysiology of diseases and to develop new therapeutic strategies. This article summarizes the various types of experimental animal models of repaired tetralogy of Fallot published to date in the literature, with the aim of achieving a greater understanding of the deleterious mechanisms that may lead to these known late and sometimes lethal complications. In addition to analysing the type of animals that can be used according to a given study's objectives, needs, and constraints, the present review also evaluates the type of dysfunction that can be reproduced in our model according to the research objectives, as well as the different types of studies in which these models can be used. In view of all that, we propose a decision algorithm to create an animal model of repaired tetralogy of Fallot. This synthesis should furthermore help in the development of future studies and in the design of new experimental models, thus allowing greater insight into this disease, while not forgetting the ultimate goal of broadening future therapeutic measures to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this prevalent congenital heart disease.},

The search terms were "leishmaniasis" AND "risk factors" using Google Scholar, PudMed, and Scielo. We reviewed 177 articles, 95 studies for VL, 75 for CL, and 7 on both forms. We identified 14 categories of risk factors which were divided into three groups: socioeconomic (7), environmental (5), and climate (2) variables. Socioeconomic factors were also associated with disease incidence in vulnerable human populations of arid and tropical developing regions. Environmental and climate factors showed significant associations with the incidence of VL and CL in all the studies that considered them. Proximity to natural vegetation remnants increased disease risk in both the New and Old World while the climate conditions favorable for disease transmission differed among regions. We propose a common conceptual framework for both clinical forms that highlights networks of interaction among risk factors. In both clinical forms, the interplay of these factors played a major role in disease incidence. Although there are similarities in environmental and socioeconomic conditions that mediate the transmission cycle of tropical, arid, and Mediterranean regions, the behavior of vector and reservoirs in each region is different. Special attention should be given to the possibility of vector adaptation to urban environments in developing countries where populations with low socioeconomic status are particularly vulnerable to the disease.},

Success in the clinic is nevertheless still limited, due to unfavourable biodistribution and poor cellular uptake of AONs. Extensive research is currently being conducted into the formulation of AONs to improve delivery, but thus far there is no consensus on which of those strategies will be the most effective. This systematic review was designed to answer in an unbiased manner which delivery strategies most strongly enhance the efficacy of AONs in animal models of heritable neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. In total, 95 primary studies met the predefined inclusion criteria. Study characteristics and data on biodistribution and toxicity were extracted and reporting quality and risk of bias were assessed. Twenty studies were eligible for meta-analysis. We found that even though the use of delivery systems provides an advantage over naked AONs, it is not yet possible to select the most promising strategies. Importantly, standardisation of experimental procedures is warranted in order to reach conclusions about the most efficient delivery strategies. Our best practice guidelines for future experiments serve as a step in that direction.},

To evaluate and/or predict the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of scabies interventions, disease transmission modelling can be used. OBJECTIVE: To review published scabies models and data to inform the design of a comprehensive scabies transmission modelling framework to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of scabies interventions. METHODS: Systematic literature search in PubMed, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library identified scabies studies published since the year 2000. Selected papers included modelling studies and studies on the life cycle of scabies mites, patient quality of life and resource use. Reference lists of reviews were used to identify any papers missed through the search strategy. Strengths and limitations of identified scabies models were evaluated and used to design a modelling framework. Potential model inputs were identified and discussed. FINDINGS: Four scabies models were published: a Markov decision tree, two compartmental models, and an agent-based, network-dependent Monte Carlo model. None of the models specifically addressed crusted scabies, which is associated with high morbidity, mortality, and increased transmission. There is a lack of reliable, comprehensive information about scabies biology and the impact this disease has on patients and society. DISCUSSION: Clinicians and health economists working in the field of scabies are encouraged to use the current review to inform disease transmission modelling and economic evaluations on interventions against scabies.},

This systematic review summarizes the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes after ACS therapy in animal models. METHODS: An electronic search strategy incorporating MeSH and keywords was performed using all known literature databases and in accordance with PRISMA guidance (PROSPERO CRD42019119663). RESULTS: Of the 669 studies identified, eventually 64 were included. The majority of studies utilized dexamethasone at relative high dosages and primarily involved rodents. There was a high risk of bias, mostly due to lack of randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding. The main outcomes reported on was neuropathological, particularly glucocorticoid receptor expression and neuron densities, and neurobehavior. Overall there was an upregulation of glucocorticoid receptors with lower neuron densities and a dysregulation of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. This coincided with various adverse neurobehavioral outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In animal models, ACSs consistently lead to deleterious long-term neurocognitive effects. This may be due to the specific agents, i.e., dexamethasone, or the repetitive/higher total dosing used. ACS administration varied significantly between studies and there was a high risk of bias. Future research should be standardized in well-characterized models.},

	abstract = {Large carnivores are persecuted globally because they threaten human industries and livelihoods. How this conflict is managed has consequences for the conservation of large carnivores and biodiversity more broadly. Mitigating human-predator conflict should be evidence-based and accommodate people's values while protecting carnivores. Despite much research into human and large-carnivore coexistence strategies, there have been few attempts to document the success of conflict-mitigation strategies on a global scale. We conducted a meta-analysis of global research on conflict mitigation related to large carnivores and humans. We focused on conflicts that arise from the threat large carnivores pose to livestock. We first used structured and unstructured searching to identify replicated studies that used before-after or control-impact design to measure change in livestock loss as a result of implementing a management intervention. We then extracted relevant data from these studies to calculate an overall effect size for each intervention type. Research effort and focus varied among continents and aligned with the histories and cultures that shaped livestock production and attitudes toward carnivores. Livestock guardian animals most effectively reduced livestock losses. Lethal control was the second most effective control, although its success varied the most, and guardian animals and lethal control did not differ significantly. Financial incentives have promoted tolerance of large carnivores in some settings and reduced retaliatory killings. We suggest coexistence strategies be location-specific, incorporate cultural values and environmental conditions, and be designed such that return on financial investment can be evaluated. Improved monitoring of mitigation measures is urgently required to promote effective evidence-based policy.},

A reference check and quality assessment were performed. RESULTS: A total of 32 articles were included. TBI patients with DAI had a favourable outcome in 62\%. The risk of unfavourable outcome in TBI with DAI was three times higher than in TBI without DAI. Odds ratio (OR) for unfavourable outcome was 2.9 per increase of DAI grade on MRI. Lesions located in the corpus callosum were associated with an unfavourable outcome. Other specific lesion locations and lesions count showed inconsistent results regarding outcome. Lesion volume was predictive for outcome only on apparent diffusion coefficient and fluid attenuation inversion recovery MRI sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of DAI on MRI in patients with TBI results in a higher chance of unfavourable outcome. With MRI grading, OR for unfavourable outcome increases threefold with every grade.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent experimental studies suggest that currently used anesthetics have neurotoxic effects on young animals. Clinical studies are increasingly publishing about the effects of anesthesia on the long-term outcome, providing contradictory results. The selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist dexmedetomidine has been suggested as an alternative nontoxic sedative agent. AIMS: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the potential neuroprotective and neurobehavioral effects of dexmedetomidine in young animals and children. METHODS: Systematic searches separately for preclinical and clinical studies were performed in Medline Ovid and Embase on February 14, 2018. RESULTS: The initial search found preclinical (n = 661) and clinical (n = 240) studies. A total of 20 preclinical studies were included. None of the clinical studies met the predefined eligibility criteria. Histologic injury by dexmedetomidine was evaluated in 11 studies, and was confirmed in three of these studies (caspase-3 activation or apoptosis). Decrease of injury caused by another anesthetic was evaluated in 16 studies and confirmed in 13 of these. Neurobehavioral tests were performed in seven out of the 20 studies. Of these seven rodent studies, three studies tested the effects of dexmedetomidine alone on neurobehavioral outcome in animals (younger than P21). All three studies found no negative effect of dexmedetomidine on the outcome. In six studies, outcome was evaluated when dexmedetomidine was administered following another anesthetic. Dexmedetomidine was found to lessen the negative effects of the anesthetic. CONCLUSION: In animals, dexmedetomidine was found not to induce histologic injury and to show a beneficial effect when administered with another anesthetic. No clinical results on the long-term effects in children have been identified yet.},

	abstract = {The therapeutic application of human-animal interaction has gained interest recently. One form this interest takes is the use of service dogs as complementary treatment for veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Many reports on the positive effect of PTSD Service Dogs (PSDs) on veterans exist, though most are indirect, anecdotal, or based on self-perceived welfare by veterans. They therefore only give a partial insight into PSD effect. To gain a more complete understanding of whether PSDs can be considered an effective complementary treatment for PTSD, a scoping literature review was performed on available studies of PSDs. The key search words were 'dog', 'canine', 'veteran', and 'PTSD'. This yielded 126 articles, of which 19 matched the inclusion criteria (six empirical studies). Recurrent themes in included articles were identified for discussion of methodology and/or results. It was found that results from most included studies were either applicable to human-animal interaction in general or other types of service animals. They therefore did not represent PSDs specifically. Studies which did discuss PSDs specifically only studied welfare experience in veterans, but used different methodologies. This lead us to conclude there is currently no undisputed empirical evidence that PSDs are an effective complementary treatment for veterans with PTSD other than reports on positive welfare experience. Additionally, the lack of development standardization and knowledge regarding welfare of PSDs creates risks for both human and animal welfare. It is therefore recommended that a study on the effect of PSDs be expanded to include evaluation methods besides self-perceived welfare of assisted humans. Future studies could include evaluations regarding human stress response and functioning, ideally conducted according to validated scientific methodologies using objective measurement techniques to identify the added value and mechanisms of using PSDs to assist treatment of PTSD in humans.},

	abstract = {Feather pecking (FP) is a significant issue in laying hens, which impacts societal acceptance of poultry farming, farm productivity, and bird welfare. Environmental enrichment-modifications of the environment to stimulate biological functioning and psychological well-being of animals-is one management strategy farmers can use to mitigate FP. However, inconsistent results of environmental enrichment are reported across studies questioning its value. A meta-analysis was used to determine the effect of environmental enrichment on FP and feather damage (FD) in laying hens. A systematic review of published literature from 4 databases resulted in 23 publications that met inclusion criteria. Feather pecking and FD outcomes were standardized between studies using different scoring systems. Driving variables included the presence of enrichment, production period when the enrichment started, housing type, beak trimming, bird strain, and age of the birds when FP and FD was measured. Considering the experiment as a random effect, linear mixed model analysis was used in a 2-step approach, whereby variables with a P {\textless} 0.30 in univariate analysis were included within the subsequent multivariate analysis. Variables with P {\textless} 0.05 in the multivariate analysis were retained in the final models. Model selection and evaluation were based on corrected Akaike information criteria, the root mean square prediction errors, and concordance correlation coefficients. A higher frequency of FP was observed in flocks lacking enrichment (P {\textless} 0.001), with increased age (P = 0.001), and in cage housing systems (P = 0.002). Similarly, FD increased in flocks lacking enrichment (P = 0.018), with increased age (P {\textless} 0.001), in the absence of beak trimming (P = 0.001) and in cage housing systems (P = 0.042). This meta-analysis confirmed the effectiveness of environmental enrichment in reducing FP and FD. Nevertheless, the modest ability of enrichment to dampen FD (-0.14 ± 0.06, 1-4 scale) suggests that other management strategies must be implemented in conjunction with environmental enrichment to successfully manage FP and resulting FD.},

	abstract = {Soybean meal and poultry offal meal are protein ingredients commonly used in the formulation of commercial diets for dogs. However, there remains great variability in the data on the digestibility of each protein source. This systematic review study aimed to examine the intake, apparent nutrient digestibility coefficients and fecal output of protein sources (soybean meal and poultry offal meal) in adult dog food as reported in published studies. The article search was conducted in August 2018 in the PUBMED, SciELO, Science Direct and AGRIS indexing databases. The literature search was performed using "digestibility", "source protein" and "dog" as the main key terms combined with sub-terms to broaden the scope of the search. Criteria were defined for readability, exclusion and inclusion of articles. Results were organized in groups according to the search in the indexing databases, totaling 1,414 articles. After the works were selected following the inclusion criteria, 17 articles were evaluated in this review. According to most studies, plant-based ingredients have a less variable nutritional composition than animal-derived ingredients and poultry offal meal increases the digestibility coefficients of nutrients and energy and reduces fecal dry matter production. Factors inherent to raw-material origin, ingredient and food processing, as well as the high heterogeneity of the methodologies evaluated in the studies are directly related to the obtained results. To ensure a more accurate evaluation of the quality and of effects on the digestibility of protein sources, we recommended that articles include ingredient processing data and that the variables be evaluated under standardized study conditions.},

Twenty-three peer-reviewed in vivo studies, comprising 50 trials, were identified between January 2010 and January 2017. The pDFA in these studies could be grouped in 5 classes: antimicrobial peptides, chitosan, lysozyme, medium chain fatty acids/ triglycerides and plant extracts. Mixed-effect meta-analyses with type of pDFA as fixed effect were performed for the growth parameters 'average daily gain' (ADG) and 'feed conversion ratio' (FCR), which are the two most important and used economic performance parameters for farmers. For each class of pDFA, results of the meta-analysis showed significantly higher average daily gain in the group with pDFA compared to the negative control group, while no significant difference with the positive control group was observed. Furthermore, a positive effect on FCR was found, i.e. significantly less feed was needed to gain 1 kg of body weight in the group with pDFA compared to the negative control group. No significant differences with positive control groups were observed for each class of pDFA, except for plant extracts, where the FCR was also significantly reduced in the treatment group. These results suggest that pDFA could reduce the use of antimicrobials without significant negative effects on performance indicators.},

	abstract = {A fracture-related infection (FRI) is an important complication that can lead to an increase in morbidity, mortality and economic costs. Preclinical in vivo models are critical in the evaluation of novel prevention and treatment strategies, yet it is important that these studies recapitulate the features of an FRI that make it such a clinical challenge. The aim of this systematic review was to survey the available preclinical models of FRIs and assess which of the key FRI-specific parameters are incorporated in these models. A comprehensive search was performed on July 1st 2017 in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. Overall, 75 preclinical studies were identified, 97.3 \% (n = 73) of which use Staphylococcus aureus as the causative microorganism. The most common mode for creation of bone instability is an osteotomy (n = 30; 40 \%), followed by the creation of a defect (n = 26; 34.7 \%). An actual fracture is created in only 19 studies (25.3 \%). 12 (16 \%) of the models include a time gap between bacterial inoculation and fixation to mimic the time-to-treatment in clinical open fracture scenarios. This systematic review reveals that animal models used in translational research on prevention and treatment of FRIs rarely incorporate all key clinical features in one model and that there is an over-representation of S. aureus in comparison to actual clinical epidemiology. To improve the relevance of these studies, existing preclinical models should be adapted or new models developed that better recapitulate the clinical condition of FRI.},

	abstract = {Background: Social dominance status (e.g., dominant or subordinate) is often associated with individual differences in behavior and physiology but is largely neglected in experimental designs and statistical analysis plans in biomedical animal research. In fact, the extent to which social dominance status affects common experimental outcomes is virtually unknown. Given the pervasive use of laboratory mice and culminating evidence of issues with reproducibility, understanding the role of social dominance status on common behavioral measures used in research may be of paramount importance. Methods: To determine whether social dominance status-one facet of the social environment-contributes in a systematic way to standard measures of behavior in biomedical science, we conducted a systematic review of the existing literature searching the databases of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Experiments were divided into several domains of behavior: exploration, anxiety, learned helplessness, cognition, social, and sensory behavior. Meta-analyses between experiments were conducted for the open field, elevated plus-maze, and Porsolt forced swim test. Results: Of the 696 publications identified, a total of 55 experiments from 20 published studies met our pre-specified criteria. Study characteristics and reported results were highly heterogeneous across studies. A systematic review and meta-analyses, where possible, with these studies revealed little evidence for systematic phenotypic differences between dominant and subordinate male mice. Conclusion: This finding contradicts the notion that social dominance status impacts behavior in significant ways, although the lack of an observed relationship may be attributable to study heterogeneity concerning strain, group-size, age, housing and husbandry conditions, and dominance assessment method. Therefore, further research considering these secondary sources of variation may be necessary to determine if social dominance generally impacts treatment effects in substantive ways.},

METHODS: We searched Medline, Web of Science, ProQuest and Google Scholar using PRISMA guidelines. Reference lists and grey literature were hand-searched. Meta-analyses were conducted in the R package 'metafor' using published odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals. RESULTS: We identified 325 articles, from which we included 10 that described case-control studies. Four risk factors were statistically significant in the meta-analysis: eating undercooked poultry (OR=4.28, 95\%CI 3.09-5.93); eating poultry cooked outside the home (OR=2.13, 95\%CI 1.66-2.72); having pet chickens (OR=3.29, 95\%CI 2.12-5.10); and overseas travel (OR=5.55, 95\%CI 3.20-9.63). Among children, having pet dogs showed elevated but not significant risk (OR=1.57, 95\%CI 0.99-2.49). CONCLUSIONS: We identified consumption of chicken meat and contact with domestic chickens as important risk factors for campylobacteriosis in Australia and New Zealand. Implications for public health: While consumption of chicken meat is a well-known risk factor for campylobacteriosis, zoonotic transmission is often overlooked. This research indicates a greater need for public health awareness surrounding zoonotic campylobacteriosis, especially for young children.},

English-language studies from the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Sciences were searched through April 2018 for observational and interventional studies reporting diagnostic characteristics of handheld and mobile phone microscopy devices as compared to field-established gold standard reference tests. Seventeen studies were included in the analysis. Findings included the high performance of the Newton Nm1 microscope in the diagnosis of Plasmodium species, Schistosoma mansoni, and soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), exhibiting sensitivity and specificity values often greater than 90\%. Similarly, the CellScope was shown to have excellent diagnostic characteristics in the detection of Loa loa and Schistosoma species. Fluorescent microscopy was found to have high specificity and sensitivity in the diagnosis of Plasmodium species. Mobile phone technologies and handheld microscopes hold significant promise in the rapid and effective diagnosis of malaria and NTDs in areas where accurate diagnosis is vital.

	abstract = {Background: Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) is the main causative agent of bovine zoonotic tuberculosis. The aim of this systematic review is to highlight the occupational exposure to bovine tuberculosis due to M. bovis. Methodology/Principal findings: A computer based literature search was carried out to identify papers published between January 2006 and March 2017. "PubMed, Cochrane Library and Science Direct" databases were searched systematically. Articles presenting the following properties were included: (i) focusing on M. bovis; (ii) concerning occupational exposure to bovine tuberculosis. A quality assessment was performed after selection of studies. Our search strategy identified a total of 3,264 papers of which 29 studies met the inclusion criteria. Of the 29 articles, 17 were cross-sectional studies (6 were of high quality and scored in the range of 6-7, 11 were of moderate quality and scored in the range 3-5), 10 were case reports, and 2 were reviews. Different occupational fields exposing to the disease were described: livestock sector, particularly in contact with dairy cattle (farmers, veterinaries and assistants, abattoir workers) and working in contact with wildlife (hunters, taxidermists). Conclusions: A specific guideline for occupational practitioners taking care of employees exposed to bovine tuberculosis is warranted and should be tailored to level of exposure. This review was intended to be the first step of such a project. Articles were identified from various continents and countries with different socio-economic situations, broadening our understanding of the worldwide situation. Published data on occupational exposure in developed countries are scarce. We had to extrapolate findings from countries with higher prevalence of the disease.},

	doi = {10.4103/1673-5374.266068},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Peripheral nerve repair is required after traumatic injury. This common condition represents a major public health problem worldwide. Recovery after nerve repair depends on several factors, including the severity of the injury, the nerve involved, and the surgeon's technical skills. Despite the precise microsurgical repair of nerve lesions, adequate functional recovery is not always achieved and, therefore, the regeneration process and surgical techniques are still being studied. Pre-clinical animal models are essential for this research and, for this reason, the focus of the present systematic review (according to the PRISMA statement) was to analyze the different animal models used in pre-clinical peripheral nerve repair studies. DATA SOURCES: Original articles, published in English from 2000 to 2018, were collected using the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases. DATA SELECTION: Only preclinical trials on direct nerve repair were included in this review. The articles were evaluated by the first two authors, in accordance with predefined data fields. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes included functional motor abilities, daily activity and regeneration rate. Secondary outcomes included coaptation technique and animal model. RESULTS: This review yielded 267 articles, of which, after completion of the screening, 49 studies were analyzed. There were 1425 animals in those 49 studies, being rats, mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, cats and dogs the different pre-clinical models. The nerves used were classified into three groups: head and neck (11), forelimb (8) and hindlimb (30). The techniques used to perform the coaptation were: microsuture (46), glue (12), laser (8) and mechanical (2). The follow-up examinations were histology (43), electrophysiological analysis (24) and behavioral observation (22). CONCLUSION: The most widely used animal model in the study of peripheral nerve repair is the rat. Other animal models are also used but the cost-benefit of the rat model provides several strengths over the others. Suture techniques are currently the first option for nerve repair, but the use of glues, lasers and bioengineering materials is increasing. Hence, further research in this field is required to improve clinical practice.},

	abstract = {In humans, proof of long-term efficacy of ketamine treatment in neuropathic pain is lacking. To improve our understanding of ketamine behavior under various administration conditions, we performed a systematic review and meta-analyses of controlled studies on the efficacy of ketamine in mice and rats with a disease model of nerve injury on relief of allodynia. Searches in PubMed and EMBASE identified 31 unique studies. Four meta-analyses were conducted. The first analysis included 19 comparisons on a single ketamine dose and measurement of effect within 3 hours of dosing and showed an appreciable effect (standardized mean difference 1.6, 95\% confidence interval 1.1-2.1). Subgroup analyses showed no effect of species, administration route, or dose. A single administration was insufficient to sustain relief of allodynia at 24 or 72 hours after dosing, as observed in our second analysis (7 comparisons) with similar effects in ketamine-treated and control animals. Chronic ketamine administration (9 comparisons) caused profound relief of allodynia when tested during ketamine exposure (effect size 5.1, 3.7-6.5). The final analysis (6 comparisons) showed that chronic administration caused a slow loss of relief of allodynia with 70\% loss of effect 24 days after end of treatment. No subgroups analyses were possible in the last 3 meta-analyses due to small group sizes. These results indicate long-term ketamine anti-allodynic effects after chronic exposure ({\textgreater}3 days) but not after a single administration. Given several limitations, extrapolation of the animal data to the human condition is tenuous.},

	abstract = {Acute or degenerative meniscus tears are the most common knee lesions. Meniscectomy provides symptomatic relief and functional recovery only in the short- to mid-term follow-up but significantly increases the risk of osteoarthritis. For this reason, preserving the meniscus is key, although it remains a challenge. Allograft transplants present many disadvantages, so during the last 20 years preclinical and clinical research focused on developing and investigating meniscal scaffolds. The aim of this systematic review was to collect and evaluate all the available evidence on biosynthetic scaffolds for meniscus regeneration both in vivo and in clinical studies. Three databases were searched: 46 in vivo preclinical studies and 30 clinical ones were found. Sixteen natural, 15 synthetic, and 15 hybrid scaffolds were studied in vivo. Among them, only 2 were translated into clinic: the Collagen Meniscus Implant, used in 11 studies, and the polyurethane-based scaffold Actifit®, applied in 19 studies. Although positive outcomes were described in the short- to mid-term, the number of concurrent procedures and the lack of randomized trials are the major limitations of the available clinical literature. Few in vivo studies also combined the use of cells or growth factors, but these augmentation strategies have not been applied in the clinical practice yet. Current solutions offer a significant but incomplete clinical improvement, and the regeneration potential is still unsatisfactory. Building upon the overall positive results of these "old" technologies to address partial meniscal loss, further innovation is urgently needed in this field to provide patients better joint sparing treatment options.},

	abstract = {Musculoskeletal diseases involving loss of tissue usually require management with bone grafts, among which autografts are still the gold standard. To overcome autograft disadvantages, the development of new scaffolds is constantly increasing, as well as the number of in vivo studies evaluating their osteoinductivity in ectopic sites. The aim of the present systematic review is to evaluate the last 10 years of osteoinduction in vivo studies. The review is focused on: (a) which type of animal model is most suitable for osteoinduction evaluation; (b) what are the most used types of scaffolds; (c) what kind of post-explant evaluation is most used. Through three websites (www.pubmed.com, www.webofknowledge.com and www.embase.com), 77 in vivo studies were included. Fifty-eight studies were conducted in small animal models (rodents) and 19 in animals of medium or large size (rabbits, dogs, goats, sheep, and minipigs). Despite the difficulty in establishing the most suitable animal model for osteoinductivity studies, small animals (in particular mice) are the most utilized. Intramuscular implantation is more frequent than subcutis, especially in large animals, and synthetic scaffolds (especially CaP ceramics) are preferred than natural ones, also in combination with cells and growth factors. Paraffin histology and histomorphometric evaluations are usually employed for postimplantation analyses.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: One of the major risk factors for OA is meniscectomy (Mx) that causes a rapid and progressive OA. Mx has been employed in various animal models, especially in large ones, to study preclinical safety and strategy effectiveness to counteract OA. The aim of the present study is to review in vivo studies, performed in sheep and published in the last ten years. METHODS: The search strategy was performed in three websites: www.scopus.com, www.pubmed.com, and www.webofknowledge.com, using "Meniscectomy and osteoarthritis in sheep" keywords. RESULTS: The 25 included studies performed unilateral total medial Mx (MMx), unilateral partial MMx, bilateral MMx, unilateral total lateral Mx (LMx), unilateral partial LMx, and bilateral LMx and MMx combined with anterior cruciate ligament transaction. The most frequently performed is the unilateral total MMx that increases changes in cartilage and subchondral bone more than the other techniques. Gross evaluations, histology, radiography, and biochemical tests are used to assess the degree of OA. The most widely tested treatments are related to scaffolds with or without mesenchymal stem cells. CONCLUSION: OA therapeutic strategies require the use of large animal models due to similarities with human joint anatomy. A protocol for future in vivo studies on post-traumatic OA is clarified.},

Simultaneously, this study identified the potential hantaviruses based on the phylogenetic diversity (PD) of hantaviruses reported in the Americas in hosts with the distribution in Mexico. A total 3862 rodents belonging to 82 species have been tested since 1999 to 2017. Overall, 392 individuals representing 43 rodent species were seropositive, and the seroprevalence ranged from 0 to 69.22\%. Seven hantaviruses genotypes have been described in Mexico and three are zoonotic. Four host species of rodents are widely distributed in Mexico harboring the highest PD of viruses. According to the hosts distribution, 16 genotypes could be circulating in Mexico and some of these represent a potential risk for public health.

The database containing information on the effects heat stress has on the productive and reproductive performance of lactating sows was composed by 20 articles published in international journals from 2000 to 2016, totalizing 2222 lactating sows. The duration of lactation was corrected to 21d. In the studies analyzed, the most representative variables were piglet weight at 21 days (kg) and litter weight at 21 days (kg). Daily ambient temperature (T°C) ranged from 15.0° to 32.0 °C. Rectal temperature and respiratory rate were higher in lactating sows maintained in hot conditions compared to those maintained in the thermal comfort range. The nutrient intake by the lactating sows was inversely proportional to the ambient temperature. The piglets weaned of lactating sows were kept in thermal comfort 90.84 heavier percentage point after 21 days of the piglets of lactating sows kept in heat stress environment. Piglet weight gain exhibited a high and negative correlation with ambient temperature. At 1 °C above the thermal comfort range (from 15° to 25°C) leads to a decrease in food intake (kg/d) and milk yield (kg/d), which represents a high and negative correlation with at room temperature, that is, as the ambient temperature increases, there is less consumption of nutrients, resulting in reduced milk production (less mobilization of nutrients to the mammary gland). Increased respiratory rate is an efficient parameter for evaluating the intensity of heat stress in lactating sows.},

For this purpose, we performed a systematic search on PubMed and Scopus databases to retrieve original studies published until August 2016. Thirty-one studies were selected using Prisma strategy, which were then submitted to data extraction and methodological bias analysis. Half of the studies showed that the number of erythrogram decreased in infected animals, indicating anaemia. In 68.2\% of the studies, the total amount of leukogram values increased, suggesting infection. The main methodological limitations were insufficient information for T. cruzi strains identification, inoculation routes and parasitological characterization. Most of the mammalian species analysed showed the same pattern of haematological changes following T. cruzi infection, indicating that haematological parameters might direct the diagnosis of Chagas disease in the initial phase.},

	abstract = {Currently, the types and distribution of the lesions induced in the central nervous system (CNS) by Trypanosoma cruzi remain unclear as the available evidence is based on fragmented data. Therefore, we developed a systematic review to analyse the main characteristics of the CNS lesions in non-human hosts infected. From a structured search on the PubMed/Medline and Scopus platforms, 32 studies were retrieved, subjected to data extraction and methodological bias analysis. Our results show that the most frequent alterations in the CNS are the presence of different forms of T. cruzi and intense lymphocytes infiltrates. The encephalon is the main target of T. cruzi, and inflammatory changes in the CNS are more frequent and severe in the acute phase of infection. The parasite's genotype and phenotype are associated with the tropism and severity of the CNS lesions. The methodological limitations found in the studies were divergences in inoculation pathways, under-reporting of animal age and weight, sample calculation strategies and histopathological characterization. Since the changes were dependent on the pathogenicity and virulence of the T. cruzi strains, the genotype and phenotype characterization of the parasite are extremely relevant to predict changes in the CNS and the neurological manifestations associated with Chagas' disease.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13071-020-04144-9},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) infection is generally diagnosed through parasitological identification of microfilariae (mf) in the blood. Although historically the most commonly used technique for counting mf is the thick blood smear based on 20 µl blood (TBS20), various other techniques and blood volumes have been applied. It is therefore a challenge to compare mf prevalence estimates from different LF-survey data. Our objective was to standardise microfilaraemia (mf) prevalence estimates to TBS20 as the reference diagnostic technique. METHODS: We first performed a systematic review to identify studies reporting on comparative mf prevalence data as measured by more than one diagnostic test, including TBS20, on the same study population. Associations between mf prevalences based on different diagnostic techniques were quantified in terms of odds ratios (OR, with TBS20 blood as reference), using a meta-regression model. RESULTS: We identified 606 articles matching our search strategy and included 14 in our analyses. The OR of the mf prevalences as measured by the more sensitive counting chamber technique (≥ 50 µl blood) was 2.90 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.60-5.28). For membrane filtration (1 ml blood) the OR was 2.39 (95\% CI: 1.62-3.53), Knott's technique it was 1.54 (95\% CI: 0.72-3.29), and for TBS in ≥ 40 µl blood it was 1.37 (95\% CI: 0.81-2.30). CONCLUSIONS: We provided transformation factors to standardise mf prevalence estimates as detected by different diagnostic techniques to mf prevalence estimates as measured by TBS20. This will facilitate the use and comparison of more datasets in meta-analyses and geographic mapping initiatives across countries and over time.},

METHODS: We compiled characteristics and findings of diet induced MetS with high-fat, high-carbohydrate, high-fat/high-carbohydrates and cafeteria diet from PubMed and Science Direct databases published in the last 5 years. RESULTS: The results on the principal determinants for the syndrome, published in the reviewed articles, were chosen to propose reference values in the rat models of food induction. CONCLUSION: The values obtained will serve as reference cut-of points in the development of the disease; in addition, the compilation of data will be useful in planning and executing research protocols in animal models.},

	abstract = {Canine and human bladder cancer present similar anatomical, morphological, and molecular characteristics, and dogs can be considered a model for human bladder cancer. However, the veterinary literature lacks information regarding cross-validation analysis between human and canine large-scale data. Therefore, this research aimed to perform a meta-analysis of the canine literature on bladder cancer, identifying genes and proteins previously evaluated in these studies. In addition, we also performed a cross-validation of the canine transcriptome data and the human data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify potential markers for both species. The meta-analysis was performed using the following indexing terms: "bladder" AND "carcinoma" AND "dog" in different international databases, and 385 manuscripts were identified in our initial search. Then, several inclusion criteria were applied, and only 25 studies met these criteria. Among these studies, five presented transcriptome data, and 20 evaluated only isolated genes or proteins. Regarding the studies involving isolated protein analysis, the HER-2 protein was the most studied (3/20), followed by TAG-72 (2/20), COX-2 (2/20), survivin (2/20), and CK7 (2/20), and the remaining nine studies evaluated one isolated protein each. Regarding the cross-validation analysis of human and canine transcriptome data, we identified 35 dysregulated genes, including ERBB2, TP53, EGFR, and E2F2. Our results demonstrate that the canine literature on bladder cancer previously focused on the evaluation of isolated markers with no association with patient survival. This limitation may be related to the lack of a homogenous protocol for treating patients and the lack of follow-up during treatment. In addition, the lack of information regarding tumor muscle invasion can be considered an important limitation when comparing human and canine bladder tumors. Our in silico analysis involving canine and human transcriptome data provided several genes with the potential to be markers for both human and canine bladder tumors, and these genes should be considered for future studies on canine bladder cancer.},

It is attracted by artificial light from urban and rural buildings, raising the risk of transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi. Despite the wide body of published information on P. geniculatus, many knowledge gaps exist about its biology and epidemiological potential. For this reason, we analysed the literature for P. geniculatus in Scopus, PubMed, Scielo, Google Scholar and the BibTriv3.0 databases to update existing knowledge and provide better information on its geographic distribution, life cycle, genetic diversity, evidence of intrusion and domiciliation, vector-related circulating discrete taxonomic units, possible role in oral T. cruzi transmission, and the effect of climate change on its biology and epidemiology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lyme borreliosis, a tick-borne disease, is endemic to some parts of North America and is an emerging disease in other parts of the world. Vaccination is an increasingly common, although controversial, method used in the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs; the reported efficacies of Borrelia burgdorferi vaccines in dogs are highly variable, ranging from 50\% to 100\%. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of vaccines for prevention of Lyme disease in dogs in North America. METHODS: Experimental and observational study designs were eligible for inclusion. The outcome of interest was the reduction of incidence of clinical illness after exposure to B. burgdorferi. Electronic databases searched were MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Centre for Agricultural Biosciences Abstracts. Clinical signs were extracted as dichotomous outcomes: lameness, anorexia, pyrexia, depression, and lymphadenopathy. Study quality was assessed using tools from the Cochrane collaboration. RESULTS: In total, 3 observational studies and 13 challenge trials were included. None of the challenge trials assessed lymphadenopathy, but for each of the remaining 4 clinical signs, a meta-analysis was performed. Compared to unvaccinated dogs, vaccinated dogs had a reduced odds of developing lameness, depression, pyrexia, and anorexia (odds ratio: 0.15-0.23). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Based on the quantitative synthesis of results from challenge studies, vaccinated dogs are less likely to develop clinical signs after exposure to B. burgdorferi compared to unvaccinated dogs. These results should be interpreted with caution, however, as several shortcomings related to quality and study design were identified. Future studies should focus on larger sample sizes in field conditions.},

	abstract = {Honey has a history of medicinal use that predates written records. In recent decades, there has been renewed interest in the use of honey in human medicine, particularly for the treatment of burns and other wounds. Several recent systematic reviews in the human literature have demonstrated the efficacy of honey in the treatment of a number of conditions, including burns, wounds and oral mucositis. The goal of this scoping review was to describe the nature and extent of the current body of evidence addressing the medicinal use of natural honey and/or its derivatives in animals. Although the focus of this review was the veterinary literature, all animal species except insects and humans were eligible, including animals used for biomedical research. Electronic databases searched were MEDLINE, CAB Abstracts, AGRICOLA, Web of Science Core Collection, and Web of Science SciELO Citation Index. A total of 397 articles reporting 436 primary research studies were included in this review. The majority of the articles were biomedical research articles (n = 350); fewer veterinary research articles were identified (n = 47). Apart from one systematic review, all biomedical studies were challenge trials. Most veterinary studies were case reports/series (n = 23), followed by challenge trials (n = 18) and controlled trials (n = 8). The animal species examined within veterinary articles consisted primarily of dogs, horses, cats and cattle, whereas the majority of biomedical research articles examined rats and mice. Wound healing was the most common indication examined; other indications examined included the prevention or treatment of gastric ulcers, bacterial and parasitic infections, toxic exposures, metabolic conditions (e.g., diabetes) and neoplasia. The majority of interventions consisted of non-medical grade honey (n = 412/436), followed by medical-grade honey (n = 29/436) and derivatives of natural honey (n = 9/436). With much of the current veterinary literature consisting of case reports and case series, high-quality primary veterinary research in the form of controlled trials or challenge trials is needed to advance this field, as well as to provide sound data for evidence-based assessments of the efficacy of honey in clinical veterinary practise.},

	abstract = {Emerging viral infections represent a public health risk pointed out by the spreading of pathogens with potential zoonotic risk. Moreover, the risk of zoonosis has probably been underestimated in occupational settings. A literature review between 2007 and 2018 was performed to identify evidences concerning the epidemiological associations between some emerging viruses and occupational diseases. Observational studies and case-reports were selected and analyzed. West Nile Virus (WNV) disease, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) disease and Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection were included in the review for their potential zoonotic transmission. The most important risk factor for acquiring WNV infection and CCHF infection is the exposure to infected mosquitoes and ticks, respectively; therefore, outdoor workers are at risk of infection. HEV is responsible for epidemics and endemics of acute hepatitis in humans, that can become infected through waterborne, foodborne and zoonotic transmission routes. A total of 10, 34 and 45 eligible studies for WNV, CCHF virus (CCFHV) and HEV, respectively, were analyzed by year, country, study design, risk group and outcomes. The occupational risk groups mainly included farm and agricultural workers, veterinarians, slaughterers, animal handlers, healthcare workers and soldiers. These findings support the need to develop effective interventions to prevent transmission of emerging viruses.},

Few articles investigated both health and performance outcomes (only health: n = 418; only performance: n = 701; both health and performance: n = 103). Most of the reviews (67.6\%, n = 1208/1787) described a meta-analysis but did not state in the title or abstract that a systematic review was also conducted, which is potentially problematic. Adherence to reporting guidelines is recommended for all systematic reviews and meta-analyses. For research areas with many reviews, an evidence repository is recommended.

Thirty-eight relevant reviews were identified. Quality assessment was based on the AMSTAR 2 framework for the critical appraisal of systematic reviews. The quality of most of the reviews captured was classified as critically low (84.2\%, n = 32/38), and only a small percentage of the evaluated reviews did not contain critical weaknesses (7.9\%, n = 3/38). Particularly, a small number of reviews reported the development of an a priori protocol (15.8\%, n = 6/38), and few reviews stated that key review steps were conducted in duplicate (study selection/screening: 26.3\%, n = 10/38; data extraction: 15.8\%, n = 6/38).

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) has recently emerged as an attractive target for neuromodulation therapy since primary sensory neurons and their soma in DRGs are important sites for pathophysiologic changes that lead to neuropathic pain. Our aim was to create evidence synthesis about the effects of electrical stimulation of DRG in the context of pain from in vitro and in vivo animal models, analyze methodology and quality of studies in the field. METHODS: For conducting systematic review we searched three data bases: MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science. The quality of included studies was assessed with the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation risk of bias tool for animal studies. The study was registered in the Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies data base. RESULTS: We included six in vitro and eight in vivo animal studies. All included in vitro studies combined neurostimulation with substances or drugs and reported an improvement in pain-related parameters due to neurostimulation. Among in vivo studies, six used pulsed radiofrequency, while two used electrical field stimulation. All in vivo studies reported improvement in pain-related behavior following stimulation. Meta-analysis was not possible because of heterogeneity and missing data. The quality of included studies was suboptimal since all had an unclear risk of bias in multiple domains. CONCLUSIONS: Limited data from in vitro and in vivo animal studies indicate that electrical stimulation of DRG has a positive therapeutic effect in the context of pain-related outcomes. Further studies with a standardized methodological approach and outcomes will provide useful information about electrical stimulation of DRG in animal models.},

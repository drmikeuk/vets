	abstract = {Common routine management practices in cattle, such as castration and disbudding, are recognized as being painful. In the United States (U.S.), these procedures are frequently performed without pain mitigation and there are currently no drugs federally approved for such use. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as meloxicam, flunixin meglumine and aspirin, are the most commonly used analgesics in U.S. food-animal production systems. However, the body of research investigating the effectiveness of these pharmaceuticals to control pain in cattle at castration and disbudding has not been comprehensively evaluated. Therefore, this review examined existing literature to summarize meloxicam, flunixin and aspirin (1) pharmacokinetics (PK) and (2) administration outcome in regard to pain control during castration and disbudding procedures, in cattle. Following systematic searches and screening, 47 PK and 44 publications were extracted for data and are presented. The sample size contained notable variability and a general deficiency of validated and replicated methodologies for assessing pain in cattle remain substantial challenges within this research area. Future research should prioritize replication of pain assessment methodologies across different experimental conditions to close knowledge gaps identified by the present study and facilitate examination of analgesic efficacy.},

	abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance in companion animals is a major public health concern worldwide due to the animals' zoonotic potential and ability to act as a reservoir for resistant genes. We report on the first use of meta-analysis and a systematic review to analyze the prevalence of vancomycinresistant Enterococcus (VRE) in companion animals. Databases such as MedLib, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched. The information was extracted by two independent reviewers and the results were reviewed by a third. Two reviewers independently assessed the study protocol using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analysis (PRISMA) checklist and the study quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist for prevalence data. OpenMeta analyst and comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) were used for the meta-analysis. The random effect model was used, and publication bias was assessed using the Eggers test and funnel plot. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed, and the sources were analyzed using the leave-one-out meta-analysis, subgroup analysis and metaregression. Twenty-two studies met the eligibility criteria, but because some studies reported the prevalence of VRE in more than one companion animal, they were considered as individual studies, and 35 studies were therefore added to the final meta-analysis. Sampling period of the included studies was from 1995-2018. Of the 4288 isolates tested in the included studies, 1241 were VRE. The pooled prevalence of VRE in companion animals was estimated at 14.6\% (95\% CI; 8.7-23.5\%; I$^{\textrm{2}}$ = 97.10\%; p {\textless} 0.001). Between-study variability was high (t$^{\textrm{2}}$ = 2.859; heterogeneity I$^{\textrm{2}}$ = 97.10\%) with heterogeneity chi-square (Q) = 1173.346, degrees of freedom (df) = (34, and p {\textless} 0.001). The funnel plot showed bias, which was confirmed by Eggers test (t-value = 3.97165; p = 0.00036), and estimates from the leave-one-out forest plot did not affect the pooled prevalence. Pooled prevalence of VRE in dogs and cats were 18.2\% (CI = 9.4-32.5\%) and 12.3\%, (CI = 3.8-33.1\%), respectively. More studies were reported in Europe than in any other continent, with most studies using feces as the sample type and disc diffusion as the detection method. With the emergence of resistant strains, new antimicrobials are required in veterinary medicine.},

	abstract = {Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) supplementation has been widely discussed as a strategy for improving meat quality in pig production, but the effects are inconsistent. This meta-analysis was performed to comprehensively evaluate its effects on the meat quality and growth performance of pigs. We searched the PubMed and the Web of Science databases (articles published from January 1, 2000 to October 16, 2020) and compared PUFAs-supplemented diets with control diets. We identified 1,670 studies, of which 14 (with data for 752 pigs) were included in our meta-analysis. The subgroup analysis was classified as PUFA source [conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) or linseed], concentration (high or low concentration), and initial stage (growing or finishing pigs). Our analysis found that PUFA supplementation increased the intramuscular fat (IMF) content (WMD = 0.467\%, 95\% CI: 0.312-0.621, p {\textless} 0.001), decreased the meat color L(*) (WMD = -0.636, 95\% CI: -1.225 to -0.047, p = 0.034), and pH 24 h (WMD = -0.021, 95\% CI: -0.032 to -0.009, p {\textless} 0.001) but had no influence on drip loss, meat color a(*) and b(*), pH 45 min, and growth performance. CLA supplementation improved IMF content (WMD = 0.542\%, 95\% CI: 0.343-0.741, p {\textless} 0.001) and reduced meat color b(*) (WMD = -0.194, 95\% CI: -0.344 to -0.044, p = 0.011). Linseed supplementation increased IMF content (WMD = 0.307\%, 95\% CI: 0.047-0.566, p = 0.021), decreased meat color L(*) (WMD = -1.740, 95\% CI: -3.267 to -0.213, p = 0.026), and pH 24 h (WMD = 0.034, 95\% CI: -0.049 to -0.018, p {\textless} 0.001). We discovered an increase on the IMF content in both high and low concentration PUFA supplementation (WMD = 0.461\%, 95\% CI: -0.344 to -0.044, p {\textless} 0.001; WMD = 0.456\%, 95\% CI: 0.276-0.635, p {\textless} 0.001). Furthermore, we also found the effects of PUFA supplementation on meat color L(*) and pH 24 h are concentration- and stage-dependent. PUFA supplementation can improve the meat quality of pigs, which mainly emerges in greatly increasing IMF content.},

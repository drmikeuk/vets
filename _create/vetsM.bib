	abstract = {Knowledge about acute pancreatitis has increased recently in both the medical and veterinary fields. Despite this expansion of knowledge, there are very few studies on treatment interventions in naturally occurring disease in dogs. As a result, treatment recommendations are largely extrapolated from experimental rodent models or general critical care principles. General treatment principles involve replacing fluid losses, maintaining hydrostatic pressure, controlling nausea and providing pain relief. Specific interventions recently advocated in human medicine include the use of neurokinin-1 antagonists for analgesia and early interventional feeding. The premise for early feeding is to improve the health of the intestinal tract, as unhealthy enterocytes are thought to perpetuate systemic inflammation. The evidence for early interventional feeding is not supported by robust clinical trials to date, but in humans there is evidence that it reduces hospitalisation time and in dogs it is well tolerated. This article summarises the major areas of management of acute pancreatitis in dogs and examines the level of evidence for each recommendation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to systematically review randomized, controlled trials of fluid resuscitation in animal models of uncontrolled hemorrhage and to explore potential sources of heterogeneity. METHODS: We conducted an electronic bibliographic search of published research, reviewed reference lists of included trials, and contacted authors about unpublished studies. We included all unconfounded, randomized, controlled trials of fluid resuscitation (timing, volume, or resuscitation targets) in animal models of uncontrolled hemorrhage. The outcome measure was mortality at the end of the scheduled follow-up period of the trial. Two reviewers independently applied the selection criteria to the trial reports. A third reviewer resolved disagreements. RESULTS: Forty-four trials compared fluid versus no fluid resuscitation. There was marked heterogeneity in the effect of fluid resuscitation on the risk of death, much of which was explained by the hemorrhage model used. In aortic injury models, the adjusted relative risk of death with fluid resuscitation was 0.48 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-0.71). In organ incision models, the adjusted relative risk of death was 0.76 (95\% CI, 0.49-1.18). In tail resection models, the adjusted relative risk of death was 0.69 (95\% CI, 0.38-1.25) if 50\% or more was removed and 1.86 (95\% CI, 1.13-3.07) if less than 50\% was removed. In other vascular injury models, the adjusted relative risk of death with fluid resuscitation was 1.70 (95\% CI, 1.01-2.85), respectively. Nine trials compared hypotensive versus normotensive resuscitation. The relative risk of death with hypotensive resuscitation was 0.37 (95\% CI, 0.27-0.50). CONCLUSION: Fluid resuscitation appears to reduce the risk of death in animal models of severe hemorrhage but increases the risk of death in those with less severe hemorrhage. Excessive fluid resuscitation could therefore be harmful in some situations. Hypotensive resuscitation reduced the risk of death in all the trials investigating it. An evaluation of the potential impact of hypotensive resuscitation in humans could now be warranted.},

	abstract = {Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is considered one of the most important infectious diseases of livestock because of the devastating economic consequences that it inflicts in affected regions. The value of critical parameters, such as the duration of the latency or the duration of the infectious periods, which affect the transmission rate of the FMD virus (FMDV), are believed to be influenced by characteristics of the host and the virus. Disease control and surveillance strategies, as well as FMD simulation models, will benefit from improved parameter estimation. The objective of this study was to quantify the distributions of variables associated with the duration of the latency, subclinical, incubation, and infectiousness periods of FMDV transmission. A double independent, systematic review of 19 retrieved publications reporting results from experimental trials, using 295 animals in four reference laboratories, was performed to extract individual values related to FMDV transmission. Probability density functions were fitted to data and a set of regression models were used to identify factors associated with the assessed parameters. Latent, subclinical, incubation, and infectious periods ranged from 3.1 to 4.8, 2 to 2.3, 5.5 to 6.6, and 3.3 to 5.7 days, respectively. Durations were significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) associated independently with route of exposure, type of donor, animal species, strains, characteristics of sampling, and clinical signs. These results will contribute to the improvement of disease control and surveillance strategies and stochastic models used to simulate FMD spread and, ultimately, development of cost-effective plans to prevent and control the potential spread of the disease in FMD-free regions of the world.},

	abstract = {The role of the horse in Coxiella burnetii infection has not been defined. Accordingly, a twofold approach was taken to further our knowledge on this topic: (1) conduct a systematic review of the literature to establish available evidence of C. burnetii infection in the horse; (2) undertake a biomolecular investigation of 122 cases of equine abortion, stillbirth and neonatal foal death, for the presence of C. burnetii using a PCR test targeting the IS1111 gene of C. burnetii. A review of the literature turned up seven studies that identified C. burnetii DNA in equine specimens, especially aborted fetuses, while an additional 34 studies sought to determine seroprevalence of the infection in the horse. A meta-analytical approach was taken to calculate a pooled mean seroprevalence in equines based on published studies. A seroprevalence of 15.8\% (95\% confidence interval: 9.6-23.0\%) was obtained. This figure is comparable to those previously reported in other species, especially ruminants. None of the 122 cases of equine abortion, stillbirth or neonatal foal death were positive for C. burnetii DNA. C. burnetii has rarely been looked for in equine specimens in previous studies. Cases of equine abortion should be comprehensively investigated to assess the risk of abortion in a pregnant mare infected with C. burnetii. Consideration should also be given to the possible role of the horse as a source of the organism for other animal species including humans.},

Specific veterinary telemedicine applications have been in use since the early 1980s, but little research has been undertaken in this field. The Pubmed and CAB International databases were searched for the following Boolean logic-linked keywords; veterinary and telemedicine, veterinary and telecare, animal and telemedicine, animal and telecare and veterinary and e-mail and an additional search was made of the worldwide web, using Google Scholar. This returned 25 papers which were reviewed. Of these only 2 report research. Sixteen papers had no references and 1 author was associated with 13 papers. Several themes emerge in the papers reviewed. These include remarks about the use of telemedicine, the benefits that can and are derived from the use of telemedicine, areas of practice in which telemedicine is being used, ethical and legal issues around the practice of telemedicine, image standards required for telemedicine, the equipment that is required for the practice of telemedicine, advice on ways in which digital images can be obtained and educational aspects of telemedicine. These are discussed. Veterinary practice has lagged behind its human counterpart in producing research on the validity and efficacy of telemedicine.

	volume = {99},
	issn = {1525-3198},
	doi = {10.3168/jds.2015-10427},
	abstract = {The effects of casein infusion have been investigated extensively in ruminant species. Its effect on responses in dry matter intake (DMI) has been reviewed and indicated no significant effect. The literature reviewed in the current meta-analysis is more extensive and limited to dairy cows fed ad libitum. A total of 51 studies were included in the meta-analysis and data were fitted to a multilevel model adjusting for the correlated nature of some studies. The effect size was the mean difference calculated by subtracting the means for the control from the casein-infused group. Overall, casein infusion [average of 333g of dry matter (DM)/d; range: 91 to 1,092g of DM/d] tended to increase responses in DMI by 0.18kg/d (n=48 studies; 3 outliers). However, an interaction was observed between the casein infusion rate (IR) and the initial metabolizable protein (MP) balance [i.e., supply minus requirements (NRC, 2001)]. When control cows were in negative MP balance (n=27 studies), responses in DMI averaged 0.28kg/d at mean MP balance (-264g/d) and casein IR (336g/d), and a 100g/d increment in the casein IR from its mean increased further responses by 0.14kg/d (MP balance being constant), compared with cows not infused with casein. In contrast, when control cows were in positive MP balance (n=22 studies; 2 outliers), responses in DMI averaged -0.20kg/d at mean casein IR (339g/d), and a 100g/d increment in the casein IR from its mean further decreased responses by 0.33kg/d, compared with cows not infused with casein. Responses in milk true protein yield at mean casein IR were greater (109 vs. 65g/d) for cows in negative vs. positive MP balance, respectively, and the influence of the casein IR on responses was significant only for cows in negative MP balance. A 100g/d increment in the casein IR from its mean increased further responses in milk true protein yield by 25g/d, compared with cows not infused with casein. Responses in blood urea concentration increased in casein studies (+0.59mM) and the influence of the casein IR was greatest for cows in positive MP balance (0.26 vs. 0.11mM per 100g/d increment). Responses in DMI were also correlated negatively with responses in blood urea concentration only for cows in positive MP balance. Together, these results suggest an association between satiety and deamination and oxidation of AA supplied in excess of requirements for cows in positive MP balance. Therefore, casein stimulated appetite in cows fed MP-deficient diets possibly via the supply of orexigenic AA or through a pull effect in response to an increased metabolic demand. Conversely, casein induced satiety in cows fed diets supplying MP in excess of requirements. Not precluding other factors involved in satiety (e.g., insulin, gut peptides), casein could have increased the supply of AA (e.g., Ser, Thr, Tyr), which might depress appetite at the brain level or increase the deamination and the oxidation of AA in oversupply in agreement with the hepatic oxidation theory.},

Although only half of the experiments of the initial meta-analysis reported concentrations of plasma AA and could be used in the current meta-analysis, lactational responses to CM feeding were similar to those reported previously. In the current meta-analysis, CM feeding increased plasma concentrations of total AA, total essential AA (EAA) and all individual EAA, but decreased concentrations of blood and milk urea-N.

The study included 49 comparisons of isonitrogenous (+/- 1.0\% dietary CP content) dietary treatments published since 1975 (27 experiments). The CM intake ranged from 1.0 to 4.0 kg/d (standard deviation = 0.65). Regressions were forced through the origin, weighted by sample size, and controlled for changes in dry matter intake and in dietary concentrations of CP and ether extract. Milk yield and milk protein yield responded positively to the substitution of a protein source by CM. The response in milk protein yield was affected by the type of protein source that was substituted; the positive response was half less when CM was substituted for soybean meal compared with substitution of CM for other protein sources. The latter effect was in part related to a positive response on milk protein percentage when CM replaced protein sources other than soybean meal. The response in efficiency of N utilization (milk N yield/N intake) was positive to the substitution of a protein source by CM. Negative changes in supply of metabolizable protein (MP) estimated from the 2001 National Research Council model were associated with positive responses in milk protein yield with CM substitution, a finding contrary to the expected positive relationship between supply of MP and milk protein yield. In conclusion, a protein supplement can be substituted by CM with positive effects on milk and milk protein production. These data also indicate an underestimation of MP supply associated with CM inclusion in dairy rations using the National Research Council model.},

	abstract = {Decrease of N intake (NI) with the aim of increasing efficiency of N utilization and decreasing the negative environmental effects of animal production requires assessment of the forms in which N is absorbed. A meta-analysis was conducted on 68 publications (90 experiments and 215 treatments) to study the effect of NI on net portal appearance (NPA) of nitrogenous nutrients [amino acids (AA), ammonia, and urea] in ruminants. In addition, the effect of several dietary energy and protein factors on this relationship was investigated. These factors were: dry matter intake; proportion of concentrate; diet concentrations and intakes of nonfiber carbohydrates and neutral detergent fiber (NDF); diet concentrations of total digestible nutrients (TDN) and crude protein; rumen-degradable protein and rumen-undegradable protein, as percent dry matter or percent crude protein. The effect of species and physiological stage was also investigated. Within-experiment analyses revealed that the NPA of AA-N and ammonia-N increased linearly, whereas the NPA of urea-N decreased (or recycling of urea-N increased) linearly with NI. Besides NI, many significant covariates could be introduced in each NPA model. However, only TDN and neutral detergent fiber intake (NDFi) were common significant covariates of NI in each NPA model. In this database, ruminants converted 60\% of incremental NI into NPA of AA-N with no species effect on that slope. However, at similar NI, TDN, and NDFi, sheep absorbed more AA-N than did cattle and dairy cows. On the other hand, species tended to affect the slope of the relationship between NPA of ammonia-N and NI, which varied from 0.19 for the sheep to 0.38 for dairy cows. On average, the equivalent of 11\% of incremental NI was recycled as urea-N to the gut through the portal-drained viscera, which excludes salivary contribution, and no species difference was detected. Overall, at similar TDN and NDFi, sheep and cattle increased their NPA of AA-N relative to NI increment by a similar magnitude. The higher absorption of AA-N observed in sheep compared with cattle, at similar NI, TDN, and NDFi, might result from lower losses of AA through portal-drained viscera metabolism.},

SOURCES OF DATA: A search of PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, DH data and Embase databases was performed using the keywords 'ultrasound' and 'fracture healing'. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: The evidence in vitro and animal studies suggests that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) produces significant osteoinductive effects, accelerating the healing process and improving the bone-bending strength. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: The evidence in human trials is controversial in fresh, stress fractures and in limb lengthening. LIPUS is effective in delayed unions, in smokers and in diabetic population. GROWING POINTS: LIPUS is an alternative, less invasive form of treatment for complicated fractures, in patients with poor bone healing and may play a role in the management of large-scale bone defects producing substantial cost savings and decreasing associated disability. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: There is heterogeneity among in vitro, animal studies and their application to human studies. Further randomized controlled trials of high methodological quality are needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Canine distemper virus (CDV) is the etiological agent of one of the most infectious diseases of domestic dogs, also known as a highly prevalent viral infectious disease of carnivores and posing a conservation threat to endangered species around the world. To get a better panorama of CDV infection in different Orders, a retrospective and documental systematic review of the role of CDV in different non-dog hosts was conducted. The bibliographical data were collected from MedLine/PubMed and Scopus databases. Data related to Order, Family, Genus and Species of the infected animals, the presence or absence of clinical signs, mortality, serological, molecular or antigenic confirmation of CDV infection, geographic location, were collected and summarized. RESULTS: Two hundred seventeen scientific articles were considered eligible which includes reports of serological evaluation, and antigenic or genomic confirmation of CDV infection in non-dog hosts. CDV infects naturally and experimentally different members of the Orders Carnivora (in 12 Families), Rodentia (four Families), Primates (two Families), Artiodactyla (three Families) and Proboscidea (one Family). The Order Carnivora (excluding domestic dogs) accounts for the vast majority (87.5\%) of the records. Clinical disease associated with CDV infection was reported in 51.8\% of the records and serological evidence of CDV infection in apparently healthy animals was found in 49.5\% of the records. High mortality rate was showed in some of the recorded infections in Orders different to Carnivora. In non-dog hosts, CDV has been reported all continents with the exception of Australasia and in 43 different countries. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic review demonstrate that CDV is able to infect a very wide range of host species from many different Orders and emphasizes the potential threat of infection for endangered wild species as well as raising concerns about potential zoonotic threats following the cessation of large-scale measles vaccination campaigns in the human population.},

	abstract = {Mastitis is the first cause of economic loss in the dairy sector. The efficacy of the existing vaccines against mastitis is questioned by several authors. It is the aim of this paper to shed some light on this question. A meta-analysis was conducted on 15 field research trials, which included a total of 7941 cows (4317 vaccinated and 3624 used as control). A random-effects model was adjusted and found significant (P{\textless}0,01). The unit used was the rate ratio between vaccinated cows and controls and was found to have a value of 0,604 with a 95\% confidence interval of [0,373; 0,979], after correction for publication bias. It was concluded that vaccination to control mastitis has a slight advantage, but the economics of its use depends on the weighting between its cost and its benefit, and therefore traditional preventive measures still have an important role to play; Mastitis vaccines can be used as a complement of all the other preventive measures but not as a substitute of these.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: No systematic review has previously been carried out on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of veterinary homeopathy in which the control group was an intervention other than placebo (OTP). For eligible peer-reviewed RCTs, the objectives of this study were to assess the risk of bias (RoB) and to quantify the effect size of homeopathic intervention compared with an active comparator or with no treatment. METHODS: Our systematic review approach complied fully with the PRISMA 2009 Checklist. Cochrane methods were applied to assess RoB and to derive effect size using standard meta-analysis methods. Based on a thorough and systematic literature search, the following key attributes of the published research were distinguished: individualised homeopathy (n = 1 RCT)/non-individualised homeopathy (n = 19); treatment (n = 14)/prophylaxis (n = 6); active controls (n = 18)/untreated controls (n = 2). The trials were highly diverse, representing 12 different medical conditions in 6 different species. RESULTS: No trial had sufficiently low RoB to be judged as reliable evidence: 16 of the 20 RCTs had high RoB; the remaining four had uncertain RoB in several domains of assessment. For three trials with uncertain RoB and without overt vested interest, it was inconclusive whether homeopathy combined with conventional intervention was more or was less effective than conventional intervention alone for modulation of immune response in calves, or in the prophylaxis of cattle tick or of diarrhoea in piglets. CONCLUSION: Due to the poor reliability of their data, OTP-controlled trials do not currently provide useful insight into the effectiveness of homeopathy in animals.},

For all medical conditions and species collectively, we tested the hypothesis that the outcome of homeopathic intervention (treatment and/or prophylaxis, individualised and/or non-individualised) is distinguishable from corresponding intervention using placebos. METHODS: All facets of the review, including literature search strategy, study eligibility, data extraction and assessment of risk of bias, were described in an earlier paper. A trial was judged to comprise reliable evidence if its risk of bias was low or was unclear in specific domains of assessment. Effect size was reported as odds ratio (OR). A trial was judged free of vested interest if it was not funded by a homeopathic pharmacy. Meta-analysis was conducted using the random-effects model, with hypothesis-driven sensitivity analysis based on risk of bias. RESULTS: Nine of 15 trials with extractable data displayed high risk of bias; low or unclear risk of bias was attributed to each of the remaining six trials, only two of which comprised reliable evidence without overt vested interest. For all N = 15 trials, pooled OR = 1.69 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.12 to 2.56]; P = 0.01. For the N = 2 trials with suitably reliable evidence, pooled OR = 2.62 [95\% CI, 1.13 to 6.05]; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis provides some very limited evidence that clinical intervention in animals using homeopathic medicines is distinguishable from corresponding intervention using placebos. The low number and quality of the trials hinders a more decisive conclusion.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Systematic review of the research evidence in veterinary homeopathy has never previously been carried out. This paper presents the search methods, together with categorised lists of retrieved records, that enable us to identify the literature that is acceptable for future systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in veterinary homeopathy. METHODS: All randomised and controlled trials of homeopathic intervention (prophylaxis and/or treatment of disease, in any species except man) were appraised according to pre-specified criteria. The following databases were systematically searched from their inception up to and including March 2011: AMED; Carstens-Stiftung Homeopathic Veterinary Clinical Research (HomVetCR) database; CINAHL; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; Embase; Hom-Inform; LILACS; PubMed; Science Citation Index; Scopus. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty records were retrieved; 38 satisfied the acceptance criteria (substantive report of a clinical treatment or prophylaxis trial in veterinary homeopathic medicine randomised and controlled and published in a peer-reviewed journal), and were thus eligible for future planned systematic review. Approximately half of the rejected records were theses. Seven species and 27 different species-specific medical conditions were represented in the 38 papers. Similar numbers of papers reported trials of treatment and prophylaxis (n=21 and n=17 respectively) and were controlled against placebo or other than placebo (n=18, n=20 respectively). Most research focused on non-individualised homeopathy (n=35 papers) compared with individualised homeopathy (n=3). CONCLUSION: The results provide a complete and clarified view of the RCT literature in veterinary homeopathy. We will systematically review the 38 substantive peer-reviewed journal articles under the main headings: treatment trials; prophylaxis trials.},

However, this is a vastly under-researched area, and the research to date has been largely descriptive, in the form of case studies, or has used only small groups of participants with no control condition. Remarkably few studies have utilized gold standard randomized controlled designs. The aim of the present review was to examine the current state of the literature in regard to only randomized controlled trials (RCts) examining the psychosocial benefits of aaIs, which is a necessary step in order to move the field forward. A search of relevant databases was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and meta-analyses (PRISma) guidelines. A total of 66,180 articles were identified at the outset; this was reduced to eight articles (involving 7 studies), following the removal of duplicates (39,377), unrelated titles (26,525), and those that did not meet inclusion criteria (270). Findings from the present review suggest that aaIs may be of benefit to a wide range of individuals, including children with autism, and adults with psychological disorders, including schizophrenia. However, further research using well-designed RCts is required to more definitively explore what specific types of aaI are beneficial for specific populations.

In this study, we aim at summarizing the current knowledge on the influence of GIN infections on sheep production by conducting a systematic review. A subsequent meta-analysis of relevant studies was performed to provide an estimate of the effect of GIN infections on weight gain, wool production and milk yield. METHODS: A literature search was performed on the CAB, Pubmed and Web of Science database for the period 1960-2012. Inclusion criteria were: 1) Measurement of at least one production parameter. 2) Comparison between groups of sheep with different nematode burdens. 3) Same conditions regarding all aspects except parasite burden between groups. 4) Quantitative measurements of one or more production traits. RESULTS: Altogether, 88 studies describing 218 trials were included in this review. The majority of studies (86\%) reported that GIN infections had a negative effect on production but this was reported to be statistically significant in only 43\% of the studies. Meta-analysis indicated that performances of sheep infected with nematodes was 85, 90 and 78\% of the performance in uninfected individuals for weight gain, wool production and milk yield respectively. Our results suggest a possible reporting bias or small study effect for the estimation of the impact of GIN infections on weight gain. Finally, a general linear model provided an estimate for the decrease in weight gain in relation to the increase in faecal egg count of nematodes. CONCLUSION: This study underlines the importance of GIN infections for sheep production and highlights the need to improve parasite management in sheep, in particular in face of challenges such as anthelmintic resistance.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The EC Regulation for Organic Farming states that organic livestock should be treated preferably with phytotherapeutic products. In spite of the high importance of organic livestock in Europe, primarily ruminants, today almost no phytotherapeutic product is registered for livestock. Also, information regarding veterinary phytotherapy is rare. The aim of this paper is to find approaches to cope with health problems of organic ruminants in Europe on the basis of findings from the European ethnoveterinary medicine (EuEVM). METHODS: A systematic review of ethno-biomedicinal papers was conducted with the aid of the Scopus database, and 75 papers, from European countries were analyzed regarding ethnoveterinary information. RESULTS: A total of 590 plant species referring to 102 different plant families are reported to be used for animal treatment, with Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Lamiaceae being the most important families. The traditional use of some plant species (e.g. mallow, chamomile, wormwood) corresponds with findings from recent scientific literature. The large number of less studied plant species, such as white lupin as an antiparasitic herb, and Helleborus spp. as potential immunostimulatory agent, opens an interesting field for future research. CONCLUSIONS: In general, EuEVM provides interesting treatment approaches for gastrointestinal and dermatological disorders as well as parasitosis. Findings regarding disorders of female genital or respiratory tract are less consistent. Nevertheless, EuEVM offers a solid basis for stimulating research in veterinary phytotherapy in Europe with a perspective to solve animal health problems in organic or even nonorganic ruminant production.

	abstract = {Bovine paratuberculosis is a disease characterized by chronic granulomatous enteritis causing protein-losing enteropathy. Adverse effects on animal productivity are key drivers in the attempt to control paratuberculosis at the farm level. Economic models require an accurate estimation of the production effects associated with paratuberculosis. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of paratuberculosis on milk production. A total of 20 effect estimates from 15 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Substantial between-study heterogeneity was observed. Subgroup analysis by case definition and study design was carried out to investigate heterogeneity. The majority of between-study variation was attributed to studies that defined cases on serology. Calculation of a pooled effect estimate was only appropriate for studies that defined cases by organism detection. A reduction in milk yield, corrected for lactation number and herd of origin of 1.87kg/d, equivalent to 5.9\% of yield, was associated with fecal culture or PCR positivity in individual cows.},

We systematically reviewed published literature for evidence of a relationship between antimicrobial use in agricultural animals and drug-resistant foodborne campylobacteriosis in humans. Based on publications from the United States (U.S.), Canada and Denmark from 2010 to July 2014, 195 articles were retained for abstract review, 50 met study criteria for full article review with 36 retained for which data are presented. Two publications reported increase in macrolide resistance of Campylobacter coli isolated from feces of swine receiving macrolides in feed, and one of these described similar findings for tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones. A study in growing turkeys demonstrated increased macrolide resistance associated with therapeutic dosing with Tylan(R) in drinking water. One publication linked tetracycline-resistant C. jejuni clone SA in raw cow's milk to a foodborne outbreak in humans. No studies that identified farm antimicrobial use also traced antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter from farm to fork. Recent literature confirms that on farm antibiotic selection pressure can increase colonization of animals with drug-resistant Campylobacter spp. but is inadequately detailed to establish a causal relationship between use of antimicrobials in agricultural animals and prevalence of drug-resistant foodborne campylobacteriosis in humans.},

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Research questions relating to the accuracy of diagnostic techniques for meniscal injury and the effects of meniscal treatment were defined. An electronic database search of PubMed and CAB Abstracts was performed during March 2015. Data were extracted for study participants, design, intervention, outcome measures and results. Studies were evaluated using a validated instrument for assessing methodological quality and assigned a Quality Index score. A level of evidence was then assigned to each study. RESULTS: Eighty-nine studies were identified. The median Quality Index score was 14 out of a possible 26. Twenty-seven studies were prospective case series, 31 retrospective case series, 16 animal research and 15 cadaveric studies. There were no class I or class II studies, 27 class III and 62 class IV studies. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a large number of publications the quality of evidence was generally low. No one study or combination of studies provided high quality evidence to support one diagnostic or surgical intervention over another for meniscal injuries in dogs with cranial cruciate ligament failure.},

Here we examine post hunter-gatherer LUC as a driver of infectious disease in one biogeographical region with a compressed and documented history--continental Australia. We do this by examining land-use and native vegetation change (LUCC) associations with infectious disease emergence identified through a systematic (1973-2010) and historical (1788-1973) review of infectious disease literature of humans and animals. We find that 22\% (20) of the systematically reviewed EIDs are associated with LUCC, most frequently where natural landscapes have been removed or replaced with agriculture, plantations, livestock or urban development. Historical clustering of vector-borne, zoonotic and environmental disease emergence also follows major periods of extensive land clearing. These advanced stages of LUCC are accompanied by changes in the distribution and density of hosts and vectors, at varying scales and chronology. This review of infectious disease emergence in one continent provides valuable insight into the association between accelerated global LUC and concurrent accelerated infectious disease emergence.},

	abstract = {With the recent increase in interest in personality in dogs, behavioral assays of their behavior have proliferated. There has been particularly strong interest in predicting adult behavior from puppy tests. As a result, researchers and practitioners seeking to measure personality in puppies are faced with a bewildering array of options and no clear guide as to what behavioral assays have been developed or which personality dimensions those assays measure effectively. To address this issue, we used an 'expert-categorization' procedure-a standardized method often used in the course of meta-analyses-to identify the subset of those assays consensually judged to measure major personality dimensions effectively. We used this procedure to identify all relevant puppy tests and to categorize them in terms of their ability to measure nine personality dimensions identified in previous research (activity, aggressiveness, boldness/self-assuredness, exploration, fearfulness/nervousness, reactivity, sociability, submissiveness, trainability/responsiveness). Specifically, we identified 264 assay subtests, derived from 47 studies, which were subjected to a standardized categorization procedure undertaken independently by six expert judges. These procedures yielded a set of behavioral tests judged to measure the nine dimensions effectively and also demonstrated a widely applicable method for developing and evaluating behavioral test batteries.

	abstract = {The objective of this review was two-fold. First, a series of meta-analyses (analyses of treatment effects across studies) were performed on available data from scientific literature to determine whether sow behaviour, performance, or physiology differed for sows in group pens or individual stalls. Second, research publications in areas of performance and health, physiology, and behaviour of pregnant gilts and sows in studies that directly compared gestation sow housing systems were summarized. Common systems were stalls, tethers, and various types of group housing systems. Results of meta-analyses showed that the average levels of productivity, oral-nasal-facial behaviors (ONF), and blood cortisol were statistically similar for sows in group pens and stalls. For the review, in some studies, circulating cortisol concentrations were greater among gestating females kept in tethers compared with other systems; however, overall cortisol was not altered by housing system. Immune parameters were largely not influenced by housing system. Housing system did not alter heart rate. Gestation housing system may influence sow behaviour including stereotypic ONF, postural locomotory, feeding behaviors, or social behaviors. Overall, total ONF behaviors were comparable between gestation sow housing systems. However, tethered and stalled sows exhibited more stereotypic ONF compared with sows in group or outdoor systems. Compared with group housing, individually confining sows during gestation resulted in postural and movement restrictions. Stall size and design can impact postural adjustments and inter-stall aggression of individually housed sows. Inconsistent performance and health results were found among sow housing studies. Sows in stalls consistently had equal or greater reproductive performance compared with sows in other systems. Farrowing rate for sows in individual stalls was equal to or superior to sows in other systems. Farrowing rate was clearly superior among sows in stalls compared with group systems, where dynamic social groups were employed. However, tethered sows may have reduced litter size and increased piglet birth weight. Sows in group housing systems, particularly electronic sow feeder (ESF) systems, had injury scores greater than sows in either stalls or tethers. Gestation housing system (individual vs group) may impact sow welfare in the farrowing area (using stalls or pens). In conclusion, although individual studies found significant housing system effects, subjected to the overall evidence from adequately designed studies meta-analyses revealed that gestation stalls (non-tethered) or well-managed pens generally (but not in all cases) produced similar states of welfare for pregnant gilts or sows in terms of physiology, behaviour, performance, and health. More research is needed to develop and evaluate the efficacy of sow housing systems, including studies that directly compare sow housing systems using a multi-disciplinary approach.},

In Part II, a critical review of the economic impacts of the disease, risk factors, and important control measures are presented to enable Canadian bovine practitioners to successfully implement control strategies and participate in control programs. In cattle positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay, there is a 2.4 times increase in the risk of their being culled, and their lactational 305-day milk production is decreased by at least 370 kg. Reduced slaughter value and premature culling account for losses of CDN dollars 1330 per year per infected 50-cow herd. Research has failed to show a consistent association between Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis test status and reduced fertility or risk of clinical or subclinical mastitis. Host level factors include age and level of exposure, along with source of exposure, such as manure, colostrum, or milk. Agent factors involve the dose of infectious agent and strains of bacteria. Environmental management factors influence the persistence of the bacteria and the level of contamination in the environment. Emphasizing a risk factor approach, various control strategies are reviewed, including a number of national control programs currently in place throughout the world, specifically Australia, The Netherlands, and the United States. By reviewing the scientific literature about Johne's disease, control of the disease could be pursued through informed implementation of rational biosecurity efforts and the strategic use of testing and culling.},

CONCLUSIONS: Results from the 2 analyzers are not directly comparable and extrapolation of the results from one machine to the other should be avoided. Standardization of the preanalytical variables (eg, blood collection, holding time, and temperature during holding) is strongly recommended. It is recommended that each site create their own "site specific" reference values for each machine and that test samples be compared only to the standardized reference values established at that center. Start-up and consumable costs vary between countries and local comparisons should be performed. Decisions should be made based on the expected use of the machine and if multiple operators will be using it.},

CONCLUSIONS: Of the questions evaluated, only the association between anesthesia-related cardiopulmonary arrest and better outcomes was supported by strong evidence. There is some evidence from the human literature that the use of cognitive aids, standardized didactic, and hands-on training with high-fidelity simulators, team and leadership training, and post-cardiac arrest debriefing improve adherence to cardiopulmonary resuscitation guidelines and, in some cases, patient outcomes.

Forty-three publications from 1982 to 2004 with consistent intramuscular fat data were evaluated. Two studies were undertaken: 1) with fat thickness as a covariate and 2) with BW as a covariate. The intercept-slope covariance estimate was not statistically different from 0 for LM area (P = 0.11), KPH (P = 0.19), and intramuscular fat (P = 0.74) in study 1, and for LM area (P = 0.44), fat thickness (P = 0.11), KPH (P = 0.19), and intramuscular fat (P = 0.74) in study 2; therefore, a reduced model without a covariance component was fitted for these carcass characteristics. A covariance component was fitted for HCW (P = 0.01, study 1 and P = 0.05, study 2) and for intramuscular fat (P = 0.05, study 2). In study 1, the results for maturity indicated differences between early-moderate and late maturity for HCW (P {\textless} 0.01) and LM area (P {\textless} 0.01) but no differences for KPH (P = 0.26) and intramuscular fat (P = 0.50); for implant status, an estrogenic or combination implant increased HCW by 2.9\% (P = 0.27) or 4.8\% (P {\textless} 0.01), increased LM area by 3.2\% (P = 0.23) or 6.3\% (P {\textless} 0.01), decreased intramuscular fat by 8.1\% (P {\textless} 0.01) or 5.4\% (P {\textless} 0.01), respectively, and decreased KPH by 7.6\% (P = 0.34) for estrogenic implants but increased KPH by 1.1\% (P = 0.36) for combination implants, compared with nonimplanted steers. In study 2, the results at 600 kg of BW for implant status (implant or nonimplant) indicated no differences for HCW (P = 0.63) and LM area (P = 0.73), but there were differences for fat thickness (P {\textless} 0.01), KPH (P {\textless} 0.01), and intramuscular fat (P {\textless} 0.01); the results for maturity (early-moderate or late maturity) indicated no differences for HCW (P = 0.94), but there were differences for LM area (P {\textless} 0.01), fat thickness (P {\textless} 0.01), KPH (P {\textless} 0.01), and intramuscular fat (P {\textless} 0.01). The difference between early-moderate and late maturity (studies 1 and 2) confirmed that frame size accounts for a substantial portion of the variation in carcass composition. Studies 1 and 2 also indicate that implant status had significant effects on carcass quality.},

Forty-three publications reporting 51 studies (21 controlled studies (CS) and 30 challenge studies (ChS)) and 85 unique treatment comparisons were included in the review. The alternative treatment categories were nutraceuticals (28 studies), breeding for genetic resistance (12), nutritional manipulation (6), homeopathies (2), administration of copper oxide wire particles (2), and biological control (1). Random effect meta-analyses (MA) and meta-regression were performed with the natural logarithm of the difference in means (lnMD) between the control and treatment groups, for fecal egg counts per gram of wet feces (FEC), worm counts (WC) or fecal egg counts per gram of dry matter (FECDM) as the outcome. Treatment effect estimates (lnMD) were back-transformed to their count ratios (CR), a relative measure of effect for controlled versus treated groups, for presentation of results. Significant heterogeneity was observed for both CS and ChS that evaluated nutraceuticals, genetic resistance and nutrition treatments. MA of ChS that investigated nutraceuticals resulted in a significant overall CR of 1.62 (P{\textless}0.01) and 1.64 (P{\textless}0.01) for FEC and FECDM, respectively and a marginal significant CR of 1.14 (P=0.06) for WC, all favoring the treated groups. MA of CS and ChS that investigated genetic resistance resulted in a significant overall CR of 5.89 and 15.42, respectively (P{\textless}0.01), again favoring treated groups. MA of CS that investigated homeopathies with FEC as an outcome were homogenous (I(2)=0.0\%) and resulted in a non-significant pooled CR of 1.61. ChS investigating copper oxide wire particle treatments and WC as an outcome, were homogenous (I(2)=0.0\%) and had a marginally significant pooled CR of 1.68 (P=0.06). Publication bias was observed for ChS with WC outcomes, indicating that small size studies reporting non-significant CR, were less likely to be published than similar studies that found a significant CR. In a meta-regression, randomization (6.2\%) and study size (29.2\%) were the main factors contributing to the total variation when the outcome was FEC, and none of the variables contributed to between study heterogeneity. When the outcome was WC, type of treatment was the only significant covariate, explaining 6\% of the heterogeneity and 38.5\% of the total variation. The methodological soundness and reporting of primary research in the selected studies were low. Our results indicate that from the studied alternative treatments, nutraceuticals and use of genetically resistant sheep might be more promising for control of GINs in sheep.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to review systematically the range of assessment tools used in cats to detect the behavioural expression of pain and the evidence of their quality; and to examine behavioural metrics (considering both the sensory and affective domains) used to assess pain. METHODS: A search of PubMed and ScienceDirect, alongside articles known to the authors, from 2000 onwards, for papers in English was performed. This was followed by a manual search of the references within the primary data sources. Only peer-reviewed publications that provided information on the assessment tool used to evaluate the behavioural expression of pain in cats, in conscious animals (not anaesthetised cats), were included. RESULTS: No previous systematic reviews were identified. One hundred papers were included in the final assessment. Studies were primarily related to the assessment of pain in relation to surgical procedures, and no clear distinction was made concerning the onset of acute and chronic pain. Ten broad types of instrument to assess pain were identified, and generally the quality of evidence to support the use of the various instruments was poor. Only one specific instrument (UNESP-Botucatu scale) had published evidence of validity, reliability and sensitivity at the level of a randomised control trial, but with a positive rather than placebo control, and limited to its use in the ovariohysterectomy situation. The metrics used within the tools appeared to focus primarily on the sensory aspect of pain, with no study clearly discriminating between the sensory and affective components of pain. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Further studies are required to provide a higher quality of evidence for methods used to assess pain in cats. Furthermore, a consistent definition for acute and chronic pain is needed. Tools need to be validated that can detect pain in a range of conditions and by different evaluators (veterinary surgeons and owners), which consider both the sensory and emotional aspects of pain.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research regarding zoonotic diseases often focuses on infectious diseases animals have given to humans. However, an increasing number of reports indicate that humans are transmitting pathogens to animals. Recent examples include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, influenza A virus, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Ascaris lumbricoides. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of published literature regarding reverse zoonoses and highlight the need for future work in this area. METHODS: An initial broad literature review yielded 4763 titles, of which 4704 were excluded as not meeting inclusion criteria. After careful screening, 56 articles (from 56 countries over three decades) with documented human-to-animal disease transmission were included in this report. FINDINGS: In these publications, 21 (38\%) pathogens studied were bacterial, 16 (29\%) were viral, 12 (21\%) were parasitic, and 7 (13\%) were fungal, other, or involved multiple pathogens. Effected animals included wildlife (n = 28, 50\%), livestock (n = 24, 43\%), companion animals (n = 13, 23\%), and various other animals or animals not explicitly mentioned (n = 2, 4\%). Published reports of reverse zoonoses transmission occurred in every continent except Antarctica therefore indicating a worldwide disease threat. INTERPRETATION: As we see a global increase in industrial animal production, the rapid movement of humans and animals, and the habitats of humans and wild animals intertwining with great complexity, the future promises more opportunities for humans to cause reverse zoonoses. Scientific research must be conducted in this area to provide a richer understanding of emerging and reemerging disease threats. As a result, multidisciplinary approaches such as One Health will be needed to mitigate these problems.},

	abstract = {Cereal beta-glucan may be detrimental in pig production because of negative effects on nutrient digestibility, but they may act as functional ingredients by stimulating the intestinal microbiota. This study primarily aimed to investigate relations between dietary beta-glucan and nutrient digestibility, intestinal fermentation, and manure NH3 emission in weaned, growing, and finishing pigs. Effects of dietary xylose, NDF, and CP, and pig's BW on animal responses were also evaluated. A meta-analytical approach, accounting for inter- and intra-experiment variations, was used to compute prediction models. Data from 26 studies including 107 different dietary treatments with appropriate dietary and physiological measurements were used to parameterize these models. Dietary beta-glucan concentration ranged from 0 to 6.7\%. Increasing dietary beta-glucan reduced apparent ileal (AID) and total tract digestibility (ATTD) of CP and energy (R2 = 0.12 to 0.29; P {\textless} 0.05), whereas the ATTD of DM was reduced by 10\% up to a threshold beta-glucan level of 3.5\%, above which the response became asymptotic (R2 = 0.34; P {\textless} 0.01). Increasing dietary NDF content decreased ATTD of DM and energy, and increasing xylose concentration reduced ATTD of energy and CP (R2 = 0.24 to 0.85; P {\textless} 0.05). Broken-line model indicated that cecal total VFA and butyrate concentrations increased up to a threshold of 2.5 and 1.4\% beta-glucan in the diet, respectively, above which these responses became asymptotic (R2 = 0.77 to 0.96; P {\textless} 0.05). Ileal butyrate was negatively and colonic iso-butyrate was positively linked to increasing beta-glucan concentration (R2 = 0.17 to 0.41; P {\textless} 0.05). Greater beta-glucan concentration were negatively related (R2 = 0.86; P {\textless} 0.01) to NH3 emission, indicating a reduction in NH3 emission by half with 6\% beta-glucan. Backward elimination analysis indicated that greater BW of pigs counteracted (P {\textless} 0.05) the negative effect of beta-glucan on AID of CP and energy and ATTD of DM and CP. Pig's BW also enhanced effects of beta-glucan on cecal total VFA, colonic iso-butyrate, ileal butyrate, and NH3 emission (P {\textless} 0.05). Dietary CP level potentiated (P {\textless} 0.01) the beta-glucan effects on cecal total VFA, cecal butyrate, and colonic iso-butyrate. In conclusion, this study indicates that beta-glucan can stimulate cecal butyrate and ameliorate manure NH3 emission, thereby, decreasing nutrient digestibility. Because greater BW ameliorates beta-glucan effects, finishing diets may be formulated to contain more beta-glucan than weaner diets.},

Although extensive trypanosomiasis and tsetse (T\&T) control operations have been running since the beginning of the 20th century, Animal African Trypanosomiasis is still a major constraint of livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a systematic review of the existing literature describing T\&T control programmes conducted in a selection of five African countries, namely Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Uganda and Zambia, between 1980 and 2015. Sixty-eight documents were eventually selected from those identified by the database search. This was supplemented with information gathered through semi-structured interviews conducted with twelve key informants recruited in the study countries and selected based on their experience and knowledge of T\&T control. The combined information from these two sources was used to describe the inputs, processes and outcomes from 23 major T\&T control programmes implemented in the study countries. Although there were some data gaps, involvement of the target communities and sustainability of the control activities were identified as the two main issues faced by these programmes. Further, there was a lack of evaluation of these control programmes, as well as a lack of a standardised methodology to conduct such evaluations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Past experiences demonstrated that coordinated and sustained control activities require careful planning, and evidence of successes, failures and setbacks from past control programmes represent a mine of information. As there is a lack of evaluation of these programmes, these data have not been fully exploited for the design, analyses and justification of future control programmes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews can serve as a tool in translation of basic life sciences research from laboratory to human research and healthcare. The extent to which reviews of animal research are systematic and unbiased is not known. METHODS: We searched, without language restrictions, Medline, Embase, bibliographies of known reviews (1996-2004) and contacted experts to identify citations of reviews of basic science literature which, as a minimum, performed search of a publicly available resource. From these we identified reviews of animal studies where laboratory variables were measured or where treatments were administered to live animals to examine their effects, and compared them with reviews of bench studies in which human or animal tissues, cell systems or organ preparations were examined in laboratories to better understand mechanisms of diseases. RESULTS: Systematic reviews of animal studies often lacked methodological features such as specification of a testable hypothesis (9/30, 30\%); literature search without language restriction (8/30, 26.6\%); assessment of publication bias (5/30, 16.6\%), study validity (15/30, 50\%) and heterogeneity (10/30, 33.3\%); and meta-analysis for quantitative synthesis (12/30, 40\%). Compared to reviews of bench studies, they were less prone to bias as they specified the question (96.6\% vs. 80\%, p = 0.04), searched multiple databases (60\% vs. 26.6\%, p = 0.01), assessed study quality (50\% vs. 20\%, p = 0.01), and explored heterogeneity (33.3\% vs. 2.2\%, p = 0.001) more often. CONCLUSION: There seems to be a gradient of frequency of methodological weaknesses among reviews: Attempted systematic reviews of whole animal research tend to be better than those of bench studies, though compared to systematic reviews of human clinical trials they are apparently poorer. There is a need for rigour when reviewing animal research.},

It remains difficult, however, to draw general conclusions about the effect of chronic heat stress on performance and its relationship with genetic and environmental factors, as these studies have been done under varying experimental conditions and using various experimental designs. A meta-analysis enabled us to make a quantitative review of the results from 131 published papers. The relative effects of four factors (genotype, age, group size, and amplitude of temperature variation) and their interactions with temperature were analyzed for 13 traits. After pre-correcting the data for a random study effect, the best model for each trait was selected in a stepwise procedure based on its residual sum of squares. Shell strength, daily feed intake, egg mass, and hen-day egg production were found to be more sensitive to heat stress than the other traits as they dropped by 9.0 to 22.6\% between thermo-neutrality (15 to 20 degrees C) and heat stress (30 to 35 degrees C) while yolk and albumen proportions or Haugh units showed nearly no variation with temperature ({\textless}1.2\% between thermo-neutrality and heat stress). Many interactions (17) were found between temperature and one or more factors in the 13 traits studied here, which reinforces the interest of using a meta-analysis to summarize data from the literature. This study highlighted that the impact of heat stress in laying hens depends on the genotype, age, and group size, some of which have rarely been investigated.},

	abstract = {Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the most important and widespread avian pests. In Africa, backyard poultry production systems are an important source of protein and cash for poor rural livelihoods. ND mortality in these production systems is important and seriously disrupts benefits derived from it. This study undertook an African continental approach of ND epidemiology in backyard poultry. After a systematic literature review of studies published from 1980 to 2009, a meta-analysis of spatio-temporal patterns of serological prevalence and outbreak occurrence was performed. Average ND serological prevalence was estimated at 0.67 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.58-0.75] in regions characterized by humid ecosystems, high human and poultry densities and low altitudes; 0.36 (95\% CI 0.30-0.41) in dry ecosystems at intermediate altitude where human and poultry densities are low and 0.27 (95\% CI 0.19-0.38) in mountain ecosystems where human and poultry densities are intermediate. In terms of seasonality, ND outbreaks occur mostly during the dry seasons in Africa, when environmental conditions are likely to be harshest for backyard poultry. In addition, a phylogeographical analysis revealed the regionalization of ND virus strains, their potential to evolve towards a higher pathogenicity from the local viral pool and suggests a risk for vaccine strains to provide new wild strains. These results present for the first time a continent-wide approach to ND epidemiology in Africa. More emphasis is needed for ND management and control in rural African poultry production systems.},

Materials and methods: A combined analysis (meta-analysis) was performed using all available, relevant data in a data set based on published and unpublished data. A total of 54 comparisons were made (pigs fed Bio-Mos or no Bio-Mos). The response to Bio-Mos throughout the experimental period was examined with either one or several independent variables in the model. Independent variables included weaning age, length of experiment, dietary Bio-Mos inclusion level, publication status, growth performance during the first nursery stage, antimicrobials in the diet, site of the experiment, and complexity of the first-stage diet. Analysis of variance was used to detect differences in the performance response to Bio-Mos between levels of a variable. Results: Overall, performance was better in pigs fed Bio-Mos than in the controls. The data indicate that pigs with a slow growth rate during the first 1 to 2 weeks postweaning have a more pronounced response to Bio-Mos than do pigs with a normal or accelerated growth rate. Dietary inclusion of Bio-Mos appears to be most effective immediately after weaning, but a smaller response may persist for several weeks. Implications: On the basis of this comprehensive analysis of all known available data, we conclude that Bio-Mos has potential as an acceptable growth promoter for nursery pigs.},

	abstract = {Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is a slow growing bacterium that can infect ruminants and remain latent for years without development of any clinical signs or disease. Diagnosis is often based on detection of MAP antibodies in milk or serum samples or culture of bacteria from faeces; however, these diagnostic tools are often not applicable until years after infection. Detection of MAP specific cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses can serve as an alternative and be implemented in a diagnostic tool. CMI responses can be measured at an early stage of infection, prior to development of antibodies and shedding of detectable amounts of MAP. At present, available diagnostic assays are limited by the lack of MAP specific antigens included in these assays resulting in poor specificity. The objective of this review is to provide a systematic overview of diagnostic MAP antigen candidates described to date with special emphasis on antigen candidates tested for CMI responses. Relevant information on 115 different MAP antigens was systematically extracted from literature and summarized in 6 tables of CMI antigens, secreted antigens, cell wall and membrane antigens, lipoprotein antigens, heat shock antigens and hypothetical antigens. Strategies for evaluation of novel antigen candidates are discussed critically. Relatively few of the described antigens were evaluated for their use in CMI based diagnostic assays and so far, no obvious candidate has been identified for this application. Most of the novel diagnostic candidates were evaluated in few animals and it is recommended that an appropriate sample size is included for evaluation of antigen candidates in future studies.},

	abstract = {Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis), the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis, has been identified in nine geographically distinct wildlife populations in North America and Hawaii and is endemic in at least three populations, including members of the Bovidae, Cervidae, and Suidae families. The emergence of M. bovis in North American wildlife poses a serious and growing risk for livestock and human health and for the recreational hunting industry. Experience in many countries, including the USA and Canada, has shown that while M. bovis can be controlled when restricted to livestock species, it is almost impossible to eradicate once it has spread into ecosystems with free-ranging maintenance hosts. Therefore, preventing transmission of M. bovis to wildlife may be the most effective way to mitigate economic and health costs of this bacterial pathogen. Here we review the status of M. bovis infection in wildlife of North America and identify risks for its establishment in uninfected North American wildlife populations where eradication or control would be difficult and costly. We identified four common risk factors associated with establishment of M. bovis in uninfected wildlife populations in North America, (1) commingling of infected cattle with susceptible wildlife, (2) supplemental feeding of wildlife, (3) inadequate surveillance of at-risk wildlife, and (4) unrecognized emergence of alternate wildlife species as successful maintenance hosts. We then propose the use of integrated and adaptive disease management to mitigate these risk factors to prevent establishment of M. bovis in susceptible North American wildlife species.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with alteration of the gut microbiota. In order to clarify the effect of Lactobacillus-containing probiotics (LCP) on weight we performed a meta-analysis of clinical studies and experimental models. We intended to assess effects by Lactobacillus species. METHODS: A broad search with no date or language restriction was performed. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and comparative clinical studies in humans and animals or experimental models assessing the effect of Lactobacillus-containing probiotics on weight. We primarily attempted to extract and use change from baseline values. Data were extracted independently by two authors. Results were pooled by host and by Lactobacillus species and are summarized in a meta-analysis of standardized difference in means (SMDs). RESULTS: We identified and included 17 RCTs in humans, 51 studies on farm animals and 14 experimental models. Lactobacillus acidophilus administration resulted in significant weight gain in humans and in animals (SMD 0.15; 95\% confidence intervals 0.05-0.25). Results were consistent in humans and animals. Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus ingluviei were associated with weight gain in animals. Lactobacillus plantarum was associated with weight loss in animals and Lactobacillus gasseri was associated with weight loss both in obese humans and in animals. CONCLUSIONS: Different Lactobacillus species are associated different effects on weight change that are host-specific. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of Lactobacillus species in the human energy harvest and weight regulation. Attention should be drawn to the potential effects of commonly marketed lactobacillus-containing probiotics on weight gain.},

	abstract = {Feline urine spraying inside the home is a common problem behaviour that owners seek advice for from veterinarians. Individual trials relating to a variety of interventions produce variable results, and to date, no consensus on the value of different treatments has emerged. This study therefore aimed to meta-analyse, current data from appropriate published clinical trials that evaluate treatments for feline urine spraying.Inclusion and exclusion criteria for study selection were predefined and methodological quality was assessed by two independent reviewers. Ten studies in nine publications that either evaluated pharmacotherapy or pheromonatherapy (the use of a synthetic analogue of the F3 facial fraction in the cat) were suitable for analysis. There was a significant (P{\textless}0.001) association between the use of any intervention and the number of cats that ceased or reduced urine spraying by at least 90\%. Analysis by intervention type indicated that fluoxetine, clomipramine and pheromonatherapy may each assist in managing urine spraying beyond a placebo based intervention.This is the first time meta-analytical techniques have been used and reported to evaluate the efficacy of interventions used in veterinary behavioural medicine, and it has established confidence in the value of both conventional treatments (pharmacotherapy) and a more recently developed treatment modality (pheromonatherapy) as an adjunct to the management of this problem. It is suggested that future research into treatment efficacy for this problem uses the benchmark standard of randomised, controlled trials lasting for at least 8 weeks, with the outcome criteria of cessation of feline urine spraying or reduction by at least 90\%.},

Considering the high prevalence of brucellosis, the aim of the current study was to systematically review published data about the annual incidence rate of this infection from different parts of Iran and provide an overall relative frequency (RF) for Iran using meta-analysis. We searched several databases including PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, google scholar, IranMedex and Iranian Scientific Information Database (SID) by using the following keywords: "Brucella", "Brucellosis", "Malta fever", "Mediterranean fever", "undulant fever", "zoonosis" and "Iran" in Title/Abstract/Keywords fields. Articles/Abstracts, which used clinical specimens and reported the incidence of brucellosis, were included in this review. Quality of studies was assessed by STROB and PRISMA forms. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA 11.0 (STATA Corp, College Station, TX) and P-values under 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Out of the 8326 results, we found 34 articles suitable, according to inclusion and exlusion criteria, for inclusion in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled incidence of brucellosis was estimated 0.001\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.0005-0.0015\%) annually. Relative frequency of brucellosis in different studies varied from 7.0/100000 to 276.41/100000 in Qom and Kermanshah provinces, respectively. This systematic-review and meta-analysis study showed that the highest incidences of brucellosis are occurred in west and northwest regions of Iran. Totally, the incidence of the disease in Iran is in the high range.},

There were 194 animals from 17 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, of which 173 received a known dose of MAP and 21 were exposed naturally. Results from parametric time-to-event models indicated that challenging older calves or using multiple-exposure experimental systems resulted in a smaller proportion and shorter duration of early shedding as well as slower transition to late shedding from latent compartments. Calves exposed naturally showed variable infection progression rates, not dissimilar to other infection routes. The log-normal distribution was most appropriate for modelling infection-progression events. The infection pattern revealed by the modelling allowed better understanding of low-grade endemicity of MAP in cattle, and the parameter estimates are the basis for future transmission dynamics modelling.},

Legislation issues on burn experiments are discussed. CONCLUSION: The hot water was the main method to induce burns those of third degree on the back, with anesthesia using ketamine and xylazine, after depilation. These were evaluated microscopically, without using analgesia or an antibiotic during the postoperative period. The studies were not very reproducible.},

	abstract = {Previously observed relationships between dietary composition and production of a small number of individual milk fatty acids were the motivation to examine whether equations could be developed to predict production of all the major individual milk fatty acids. Such equations could be incorporated into ration formulation programs and used to examine factors that influence milk fat composition. Data from 29 published experiments on Holstein cows that provided 120 dietary treatments were entered into CPM-Dairy to obtain estimates of amounts of individual long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) absorbed from the intestines. These derived data and other dietary and animal data including the reported fatty acid composition of milk fat were entered into a spreadsheet. Descriptors of diet included daily intake of dry matter, total fermentable carbohydrate, total fatty acids, and profile of dietary fatty acids, intake of neutral detergent fiber, supplemental fish-oil, buffer, and magnesium oxide. Cow data included body weight and days in milk (DIM). Multiple linear regression was used to develop equations to predict the production (g/d) of each of 26 major LCFA. The equations developed generally had R(2) values in excess of 0.5. Production (g/d) of total de novo fatty acids (C4:0 to C15:0) (PTdenovo) was found to be positively related to the intake of fermentable carbohydrate, and negatively related to the intake of fish oil fatty acids and the estimated total amount of unsaturated fatty acids absorbed from the intestines. The PTdenovo was greater in pasture-fed cows than total mixed ration-fed cows and was negatively related to the square root of DIM. Production of each individual de novo fatty acid was described by a fixed proportion of PTdenovo. These proportions were 0.12 +/- 0.006 (C4:0), 0.083 +/- 0.0039 (C6:0), 0.0516 +/- 0.0025 (C8:0), 0.111 +/- 0.003 (C10:0), 0.134 +/- 0.0037 (C12:0), 0.441 +/- 0.007 (C14:0), 0.046 +/- 0.0024 (C14:1), and 0.0432 +/- 0.0017 (C15:0). Separate independent equations were developed to describe the daily production of C16:0, C16:1, and the main individual preformed fatty acids ({\textgreater}C16). The productions of each of the main individual pre-formed fatty acids were generally strongly related to the corresponding estimated amount (g/d) of specific fatty acids absorbed from the intestines. Percentage estimates for the direct transfer of the major absorbed LCFA to their corresponding LCFA in milk were 42\% (C16:0); 9.5\% (C18:0); 47.5\% (cis-9 C18:1); 16.1\% (all isomers of trans-C18:1), 38\% (cis-9, cis-12 C18:2); and 31\% (cis-9, cis-12, cis15 C18:3). High dietary intake of fish oil fatty acids was negatively associated with the production of all of the major individual preformed fatty acids with the exception of C20:5 and C22:6. In some instances, particular dietary factors were found to have positive influences on production of one fatty acid and negative influences on another. For example, high levels of dietary magnesium oxide were positively associated with production of C17 fatty acids but negatively associated with production of C18:0 and cis-9, trans-11 C18:2 (conjugated linoleic acid). This analysis quantified effects of major dietary and cow factors on production of individual fatty acids in milk.},

The influence of diet type (total mixed ration- vs. pasture-based diet) on concentrations of individual fatty acids was examined. Pairwise correlations for concentrations (g/kg) of individual fatty acids in milk showed that almost all of the individual de novo fatty acids were significantly correlated with each other and with the total concentration of de novo fatty acids. Concentrations of individual unsaturated preformed fatty acids were generally positively correlated with each other but were negatively correlated with concentrations of total de novo fatty acids. Substantial variation was found in the concentrations of individual milk fatty acids and, apart from those synthesized de novo, concentrations of individual fatty acids did not vary in concert. The adequacy of literature data for the development of a model to predict the production of the major individual fatty acids in milk is discussed. The limitations associated with the currently available studies that may be used in a predictive model are 1) failure of many publications to adequately describe dietary details, 2) reporting poorly defined milk fatty acids, 3) aggregating a number of closely related fatty acids under a single category, and 4) the selective reporting of only those fatty acids that are present in milk fat in appreciable quantities. Despite these limitations, the data are sufficient to enable development of a model to predict the concentrations and production of major individual fatty acids in milk fat. The extreme variability in concentrations of individual milk fatty acids and the complex matrix of positive and negative correlations among the concentrations of many individual fatty acids suggest that separate equations will be needed to predict the production of each individual milk fatty acid.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Q fever is a main zoonotic disease around the world. The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the overall seroprevalence of Coxiella burnetii among human and animal population in Iran. METHODS: Major national and international databases were searched from 2005 up to August 2016. We extracted the prevalence of Q fever antibodies (IgG) as the main primary outcome. We reported the prevalence of the seropositivity as point and 95\% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of IgG phase I and II antibodies of Q fever in human was 19.80\% (95\% CI: 16.35-23.25\%) and 32.86\% (95\% CI: 23.80-41.92\%), respectively. The herd and individual prevalence of C. burnetii antibody in goat were 93.42\% (95\% CI: 80.23-100.00) and 31.97\% (95\% CI: 20.96-42.98\%), respectively. The herd and individual prevalence of Q fever antibody in sheep's were 96.07\% (95\% CI: 89.11-100.00\%) and 24.66\% (95\% CI: 19.81-29.51\%), respectively. The herd and individual prevalence of C. burnetii antibody in cattle were 41.37\% (95\% CI: 17.88-64.86\%) and 13.30\% (95\% CI: 2.98-23.62\%), respectively. Individual seropositivity of Q fever in camel and dog were 28.26\% (95\% CI: 21.47-35.05) and 0.55\% (0.03-2.68), respectively. CONCLUSION: Seroprevalence of Q fever among human and domestic animals is considerable. Preventative planning and control of C. burnetii infections in Iran is necessary. Active surveillance and further research studies are recommended, to more clearly define the epidemiology and importance of C. burnetii infections in animals and people in Iran.},

We reviewed 117 field estimates of parasite-induced nestling mortality in birds, showing that there was significant consistency in mortality among host and parasite taxa. Virulence increased towards the tropics in analyses of both species-specific data and phylogenetic analyses. We found evidence of greater parasite prevalence being associated with reduced virulence. Furthermore, bird species breeding in open nest sites suffered from greater parasite-induced mortality than hole-nesting species. By contrast, parasite specialization and generation time of parasites relative to that of hosts explained little variation in virulence. Likewise, there were little or no significant effects of host genetic variability, host sociality, host migration, host insular distribution or host survival on parasite virulence. These findings suggest that parasite-induced nestling mortality in birds is mainly determined by geographical location and to a smaller extent nest site and prevalence.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted to summarize the results of studies which have described the profiles of hormones during the oestrous cycle in buffalo using a fixed effect model and a random effect model. Plasma progesterone concentrations were lowest (0.30+or-0.06 ng/ml) during the peri-oestrous phase and increased (p=0.067) through the early luteal phase to a maximum concentration (1.94+or-0.03 ng/ml) during the mid-luteal phase. Circulating plasma inhibin and estradiol concentrations were lowest (0.31+or-0.01 and 11.04+or-0.13 ng/ml) during the mid-luteal phase, increased through the late luteal phase to maximum concentrations (0.44+or-0.02 and 22.48+or-0.32 ng/ml) during the peri-oestrous phase. Plasma FSH concentrations were lowest during the early luteal phase and increased through the mid-luteal phase to a maximum concentration during the peri-oestrous phase. Peripheral prolactin concentrations were lowest during the late luteal phase and increased to a maximum concentration during the peri-oestrous phase which then declined (p=0.716) during the early luteal phase. Peripheral plasma cortisol concentrations decreased from 2.68+or-0.14 ng/ml during the early luteal phase to 1.43+or-0.27 ng/ml during the mid-luteal phase (p{\textless}0.001) which then increased to 2.06+or-0.17 ng/ml during the late luteal phase. Plasma T3 concentrations decreased from the late luteal phase to the peri-oestrous phase (p{\textless}0.001) which then increased during the early luteal phase. T4 concentrations increased from the late luteal phase to the peri-oestrous phase which then decreased during the early luteal phase.},

	abstract = {The aim of this systematic review was to identify, assess, and critically evaluate the quality of evidence of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced adverse effects in dogs. Original prospective studies published in peer-reviewed journals in English (1990-2012) that reported data on the safety of NSAIDs administration in dogs were searched. For each study, design type (I, II, III, or IV) and assessment of quality (+, O, -) were rated. For each drug, quantity and consistency rating (***, **, *) and strength of evidence (high, moderate, low, or extremely low) were identified and evaluated. The strength of evidence was defined in terms of how applicable and relevant the conclusions were to the target population. Sixty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-five (55\%) research studies and 29 (45\%) clinical trials were identified. A high strength of evidence existed for carprofen, firocoxib, and meloxicam; moderate for deracoxib, ketoprofen, and robenacoxib; and low for etodolac. Quality and consistency rating were as follows: carprofen (***/***), deracoxib (**/***), etodolac (*/unable to rate), firocoxib (***/**), ketoprofen (**/***), meloxicam (***/***), and robenacoxib (**/**), respectively. Adverse effects were detected in 35 studies (55\%) and commonly included vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia. Three studies (5\%) reported a power analysis related to adverse effects of {\textgreater}/=80\%. In randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded studies (n = 25, 39\%), the incidence of adverse effects was not statistically different between treated and control dogs. Finally, most studies were not appropriately designed to determine the safety of NSAIDs, and involved a healthy nongeriatric population of research dogs.},

	abstract = {Bovine Leukemia virus (BLV) is a ubiquitous retrovirus that affects mainly cattle. Knowledge of the precise moment of infection is fundamental for identification and evaluation of factors related to BLV transmission. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide good evidence on the effects of medical interventions. The objectives were to estimate time to sero-conversion after experimental infection using data from retrieved literature and to detect factors that may influence the length of that interval using survival analysis on pooled data. An analysis using aggregate data from 36 studies totalling 438 observations was performed. From this, four sets were created and analysed by interval-censored accelerated failure time models (AFT) with different distributions (exponential, Weibull, log-logistic, lognormal and generalized gamma), and some variants of the Cox model (Andersen-Gill, smoothing splines) with and without a frailty effect. The AFT gamma model fit best and the estimated median time to sero-conversion in the null model was 57 days (95\% confidence interval (CI): 49; 75) using all data and 47 days (95\% CI: 39; 55) when only studies using experimental inoculation were considered. Some factors were consistently associated with time to sero-conversion. These included exposure by animal-to-animal contact (resulting in a seven-fold increase in time to sero-conversion compared to direct inoculation), diagnostic method to detect sero-conversion (time to sero-conversion was 1.4 times shorter when AGID was used compared to ELISA), and transmission by insect bites (biological media) delayed sero-conversion 2.3 times compared transmission via needles or other inanimate media. After fitting a frailty Cox model, results showed that sero-conversion in susceptible animals after infection using donors, in which presence of virus before the experiment started was confirmed, increased the hazard of sero-conversion two times in comparison with donors in which virus presence was not confirmed before start of the experiment. Inoculation with blood decreased the hazard 2.5 times in comparison with lymphocyte suspensions. Heterogeneity due to different research groups was also present. Finally, a Cox model with smoothing splines contained three variables: research group, route of inoculation and a non-linear spline for infective dose. In conclusion, it can be stated some factors that influence the time to sero-conversion were identified and quantified and that a moderate influence of research centre existed. These results may contribute to the estimation of the most probable times of infection in field conditions and in a better evaluation of control measures.},

The recent emergence of multidrug-resistant S. pseudintermedius isolates, in particular methicillin-resistant strains (MRSP) is a threat to small animal health and highlights the need for antimicrobial resistance surveillance to detect trends and potentially perform timeous interventions. We systematically reviewed 202 published articles to investigate temporal changes in antimicrobial resistance in clinical and commensal S. pseudintermedius isolated from dogs in 27 countries between 1980 and 2013. Resistance to the most common antimicrobials tested for in published studies and important for the treatment of staphylococcal infections in dogs were assessed separately for methicillin resistant (MRSP) and methicillin susceptible (MSSP) isolates. Stratified by MSSP and MRSP, no significant increases in antimicrobial resistance were observed over time, except for the penicillinase-labile penicillins (penicillin and ampicillin) among MSSP. However, in recent years, a few studies have reported higher-level of resistance to amikacin, gentamicin and enrofloxacin amongst MSSP. The review highlights inconsistencies between studies as a result of several factors, for example the use of different antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods and interpretation criteria. We recommend that data on susceptibility in important companion animal pathogens are collected and presented in a more harmonized way to allow more precise comparison of susceptibility patterns between studies. One way to accomplish this would be through systematic surveillance either at the country-level or at a larger scale across countries e.g. EU level.},

	abstract = {Early detection of cancers, although essential for treatment effectiveness, can be difficult to achieve, and some tests introduce additional health risks. New, non-invasive detection methods with greater sensitivity and specificity are needed. Several authors have published research suggesting that dogs may be able to detect lung, breast, prostate, ovarian, and melanoma cancers by smelling skin lesions, urine, exhaled breath, and surgically extracted tumors. We conducted a systematic search using the PubMed and EMBASE databases to identify all known published data on canine scent detection of cancers. Of 531 potentially relevant publications, 11 full text articles were examined, and 5 were selected for inclusion in the review. Two studies involved dogs detecting breast cancer (sensitivity 88\% using exhaled breath and 22\% using urine; specificity was 98\% and 20\%, respectively), 1 involved bladder cancer (41\% of urine samples detected), 1 involved melanoma (75-85.7\% of in situ tumors detected), 1 involved lung cancer (sensitivity 99\% and specificity 99\% using exhaled breath), 1 involved ovarian cancer (sensitivity 100\% and specificity 97.5\% using thawed frozen tumor samples), and 1 involved prostate cancer (18\% of urine samples detected). One study on ovarian cancer is in progress. Early successes with canine scent detection suggest chemical analysis of exhaled breath may be a valid method for cancer detection. Tests using exhaled breath showed better sensitivity and specificity than with urine. Future research should target other tumor types, and seek to identify what exhaled compounds may signal a cancer diagnosis.},

Sixty-eight articles/reports from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia were reviewed. The majority of these articles were from Tanzania. There is an increasing trend in the incidence of antibiotic resistance; of major concern is the increase in multidrug- resistant Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholera, non-typhoid Salmonella and other pathogens responsible for nosocomial infections. The increase in methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers in the countries under review confirms the spread of these clones worldwide. Clinical microbiology services in these countries need to be strengthened in order to allow a coordinated surveillance for antimicrobial resistance and provide data for local treatment guidelines and for national policies to control antimicrobial resistance. While the present study does not provide conclusive evidence to associate the increasing trend in antibiotic resistance in humans with the use of antibiotics in animals, either as feed additives or veterinary prescription, we strongly recommend a one-health approach of systematic surveillance across the public and animal health sectors, as well as the adherence to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization)-OIE (World Organization of animal Health) -WHO(World Health Organization) recommendations for non-human antimicrobial usage.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews of preclinical studies, in vivo animal experiments in particular, can influence clinical research and thus even clinical care. Dissemination bias, selective dissemination of positive or significant results, is one of the major threats to validity in systematic reviews also in the realm of animal studies. We conducted a systematic review to determine the number of published systematic reviews of animal studies until present, to investigate their methodological features especially with respect to assessment of dissemination bias, and to investigate the citation of preclinical systematic reviews on clinical research. METHODS: Eligible studies for this systematic review constitute systematic reviews that summarize in vivo animal experiments whose results could be interpreted as applicable to clinical care. We systematically searched Ovid Medline, Embase, ToxNet, and ScienceDirect from 1st January 2009 to 9th January 2013 for eligible systematic reviews without language restrictions. Furthermore we included articles from two previous systematic reviews by Peters et al. and Korevaar et al. RESULTS: The literature search and screening process resulted in 512 included full text articles. We found an increasing number of published preclinical systematic reviews over time. The methodological quality of preclinical systematic reviews was low. The majority of preclinical systematic reviews did not assess methodological quality of the included studies (71\%), nor did they assess heterogeneity (81\%) or dissemination bias (87\%). Statistics quantifying the importance of clinical research citing systematic reviews of animal studies showed that clinical studies referred to the preclinical research mainly to justify their study or a future study (76\%). DISCUSSION: Preclinical systematic reviews may have an influence on clinical research but their methodological quality frequently remains low. Therefore, systematic reviews of animal research should be critically appraised before translating them to a clinical context.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cutaneous infections with bacteria and yeasts are common in small animal practice. Treatment with systemic antibiotics or antifungal agents may not be ideal, because of the increasing development of multiresistant organisms, the cost and the possible adverse effects. Topical antimicrobials may be used as adjunctive therapy to systemic treatment or as sole therapy instead of systemic treatment. OBJECTIVE: This literature review evaluated studies on topical antimicrobial treatment of skin infections. METHODS: In vitro and in vivo studies evaluating topical antimicrobial agents were identified using a number of electronic and manual searches of textbooks and articles. Studies were evaluated, and the evidence for or against the use of the topical agents was extracted. RESULTS: There is good evidence for the efficacy of chlorhexidine and, to a lesser degree, benzoyl peroxide in canine bacterial skin infections. There is limited evidence for the efficacy of silver sulfadiazine and medical honey against bacterial skin infections in the dog, and for the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide and stannous fluoride in the horse. Good evidence supports the use of a combination of chlorhexidine and miconazole in dogs with cutaneous Malassezia infections. There is insufficient evidence to recommend any other topical therapy for use in cutaneous infections. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Although many antimicrobial topicals are marketed in veterinary dermatology, the efficacy has been reported for only a minority of agents. Randomized controlled trials evaluating various topical treatments are therefore urgently needed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of the veterinary literature investigating IV fluid therapy in dogs, cats, horses, and cattle. DESIGN: Systematic review. PROCEDURES: The preferred reporting of items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA-P) was employed for systematic review of all relevant IV fluid therapy manuscripts published from January 1969 through December 2016 in the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux International (CABI) database. Independent grading systems used to evaluate manuscripts included the updated CONsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials 2012 checklist, risk of bias for animal intervention studies, criteria for levels of evidence, and methodological quality (Jadad scale). The quality of articles published before and after 2010 was compared. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-nine articles (63 dogs, 7 cats, 39 horses, 30 cattle) from 7,258 met the inclusion criteria. More than 50\% of the manuscripts did not comply with minimal requirements for reporting randomized controlled trials. The most non-compliant items included identification of specific predefined objectives or a hypothesis, identification of trial design, how sample size was determined, randomization, and blinding procedures. Most studies were underpowered and at risk for selection, performance, and detection bias. The overall quality of the articles improved for articles published after 2010. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Most of the veterinary literature investigating the administration of IV fluid therapy in dogs, cats, horses, and cattle is descriptive, does not comply with standards for evidence, or provide adequate translation to clinical practice. Authors should employ and journal editors should enforce international consensus recommendations and guidelines for publication of data from animal experiments investigating IV fluid therapy.},

	abstract = {The use of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS; also known as "drones") for professional and personal-leisure use is increasing enormously. UAS operate at low altitudes ({\textless}500 m) and in any terrain, thus they are susceptible to interact with local fauna, generating a new type of anthropogenic disturbance that has not been systematically evaluated. To address this gap, we performed a review of the existent literature about animals' responses to UAS flights and conducted a pooled analysis of the data to determine the probability and intensity of the disturbance, and to identify the factors influencing animals' reactions towards the small aircraft. We found that wildlife reactions depended on both the UAS attributes (flight pattern, engine type and size of aircraft) and the characteristics of animals themselves (type of animal, life-history stage and level of aggregation). Target-oriented flight patterns, larger UAS sizes, and fuel-powered (noisier) engines evoked the strongest reactions in wildlife. Animals during the non-breeding period and in large groups were more likely to show behavioral reactions to UAS, and birds are more prone to react than other taxa. We discuss the implications of these results in the context of wildlife disturbance and suggest guidelines for conservationists, users and manufacturers to minimize the impact of UAS. In addition, we propose that the legal framework needs to be adapted so that appropriate actions can be undertaken when wildlife is negatively affected by these emergent practices.},

METHODS: A search using PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar was performed, followed by secondary searches of veterinary trade journals, bibliographies of relevant articles, manufacturer websites, and technical reference guides. Randomized experimental trials in healthy horses were considered that included both a treatment and control group. The endpoint required was euthanasia or laparoscopy to identify adhesion formation. A meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model, with the effect size calculated as an odds ratio (OR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical significance was set at P{\textless}.05. RESULTS: Out of 354 peer reviewed publications that met the search criteria, a total of 9 relevant studies were identified and investigated the use of sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) solutions, sodium hyaluronate/carboxymethylcellulose (HA/CMC) membranes, hyaluronate (HA), and fucoidan solutions. The odds of adhesions in horses treated with an adhesion barrier were significantly lower than untreated controls (OR=0.102; 95\% CI [0.041, 0.254]; P{\textless}.001). When analyzed as subsets for each type of barrier, horses treated with HA/CMC membranes and CMC solutions had significant OR for fewer adhesions (OR=0.061; 95\% CI [0.013, 0.292]; OR=0.119; 95\% CI [0.034, 0.415], respectively; P{\textless}.001). CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis demonstrated adhesion barriers provide a positive effect on the odds of adhesion formation. These results are tempered by the limitations of the study, including the small sample size and a bias towards publication of studies with only positive findings.},

Eight databases were searched for peer-reviewed original Arabic, English, French and Persian journal articles; the search was conducted on June 2014. Two reviewers evaluated articles for inclusion based on pre-defined criteria. Of 451 research articles, only 87 articles passed the screening process and provided bacteriological and serological evidence for brucellosis in all Middle Eastern countries. Brucella melitensis and B. abortus have been identified in most countries in the Middle East, supporting the notion of widespread presence of Brucella spp. especially B. melitensis across the region. Of the 87 articles, 49 were used to provide evidence of the presence of Brucella spp. but only 11 provided new knowledge on the frequency of brucellosis in humans and ruminants or on human risk factors for seropositivity and were deemed of sufficient quality. Small ruminant populations in the region show seroprevalence values that are among the highest worldwide. Human cases are likely to arise from subpopulations occupationally exposed to ruminants or from the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products. The Middle East is in need of well-designed observational studies that could generate reliable frequency estimates needed to assess the burden of disease and to inform disease control policies.},

In order to clarify whether any correlation between human and animal bioavailability exist, an extensive analysis of the published literature data was conducted. Due to the complex nature of bioavailability calculations inclusion criteria were applied to ensure integrity of the data. A database of 184 compounds was assembled. Linear regression for the reported compounds indicated no strong or predictive correlations to human data for all species, individually and combined. The lack of correlation in this extended dataset highlights that animal bioavailability is not quantitatively predictive of bioavailability in human. Although qualitative (high/low bioavailability) indications might be possible, models taking into account species-specific factors that may affect bioavailability are recommended for developing quantitative prediction.},

	abstract = {Bovine leukemia is a chronic, progressive, contagious tumor disease characterized by malignant lymphoid cell hyperplasia and systemic lymphadenopathy, and is caused by bovine leukemia virus (BLV). The disease affects almost all countries and regions where livestock are raised, and may even be a potential zoonotic disease. Monitoring and early prevention of bovine leukemia is very important. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis, the first of its type in the country, to estimate the prevalence of bovine leukemia in 1983-2019 in China. We included a total of 35 publications reported in 1983-2019 from the PubMed, ScienceDirect, Chinese Web of Knowledge (CNKI), VIP Chinese, and Wan Fang databases. In those articles, a total of 34,954 cattle had been tested, of which 4701 were positive for BLV infection. The estimated pooled BLV prevalence was 10.0\% (4701/34,954). Subgroup analysis showed that there were significant differences for sampling years, detection methods, and age. BLV prevalence was highest in the following subgroups: sampled before 1985 (38.5\%, 437/1134), age 3-5 years (22.5\%, 231/1044), and detected by PCR (17.9\%, 1228/5100). Regarding geographic factors, there were significant differences in the latitude and elevation subgroups. BLV prevalence was lowest in the subgroups of 20-30° latitude (3.3\%, 255/5069) 200-1000 m altitude (2.2\%, 560/11,990). We also analyzed other subgroups such as region, variety, breeding method, precipitation, humidity, and temperature, however, the differences were not significant. Our research indicated that the BLV was still prevalent in some of areas in China. We recommend strengthening the testing of cattle aged {\textgreater}1 year and using flexible testing methods such as PCR to control the prevalence of bovine leukemia and to prevent persistent infection.},

Previous studies reported that R. rosea L. improves learning and memory function in animal models. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis for preclinical studies to assess the current evidence for R. rosea L. effect on learning and memory function. Ultimately, 36 studies involving 836 animals were identified by searching 6 databases from inception to May 2018. The primary outcome measures included the escape latency in Morris water maze (MWM) test on behalf of learning ability, the frequency and the length of time spent on the target quadrant in MWM test representing memory function, and the number of errors in step down test, dark avoidance test and Y maze test on behalf of memory function. The secondary outcome measures were mechanisms of R. rosea L. for learning and/or memory function. Compared with control, the pooled results of 28 studies showed significant effects of R. rosea L. for reducing the escape latency (P {\textless} 0.05); 23 studies for increasing the frequency and the length of time spent on the target quadrant (P {\textless} 0.05); and 6 studies for decreasing the number of errors (P {\textless} 0.01). The possible mechanisms of R. rosea L. are largely through antioxidant, cholinergic regulation, anti-apoptosis activities, anti-inflammatory, improving coronary blood flow, and cerebral metabolism. In conclusion, the findings suggested that R. rosea L. can improve learning and memory function.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Cerebral ischemia can cause severe harm to people's health with the characteristics of high incidence, high disability, and high mortality. Xingnaojing injection (XNJI) is widely used in the treatment of cerebral ischemia. The aim of this review is to evaluate the efficacy and mechanism of XNJI in animal models of cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Total seven electronic databases in English or Chinese (CNKI, Wanfang, VMIS, PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) about most experiments and studies which came out before June 2018 of XNJI for cerebral ischemia have been searched. Data extraction, quality assessment, and meta-analysis are conducted according to the Cochrane standards and RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: We have identified 23 eligible studies and made a meta-analysis based on these studies. Meta-analysis shows that XNJI contributes significantly to reduction in neurological deficit score (P = 0.0002, MD = -1.25, 95\% CI: -1.92, -0.58) compared with the control group of cerebral ischemia. Subgroup analytic results demonstrate that XNJI has been more effective in animal model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (P = 0.009, MD = -1.35, 95\%CI: -2.36, -0.34) than that of permanent cerebral ischemia (P = 0.0002, MD = -1.08, 95\%CI: -1.66, -0.51). Compared with control group, XNJI could remarkably reduce cerebral infarction area (P {\textless} 0.00001, MD = -14.98, 95\%CI: -21.36, -8.59), brain edema (P {\textless} 0.00001, MD = -4.64, 95\%CI: -5.38, -3.90), and neuronal cell apoptosis (P {\textless} 0.0001, MD = -12.21, 95\%CI: 18.05, -6.37). Meanwhile, the meta-analysis shows that XNJI has a significant anti-inflammatory effect, and the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β are significantly reduced by XNJI (P = 0.001, MD = -4.13, 95\%CI:-6.68, -1.58; P {\textless} 0.00001, MD = -119.23, 95\%CI: -138.04, -100.43; P = 0.21, MD = -228.69, 95\% CI: -586.20, 128.83). Additionally, XNJI could raise the body's antioxidant function and the level of SOD and GSH-Px (P = 0.002, MD = 53.02, 95\% CI: -20.52, 85.78; P = 0.01, MD = 8.65, 95\% CI: 1.77, 15.48) and decrease the level of MDA (P {\textless} 0.00001, MD = -4.16, 95\% CI: -5.50, -2.82). CONCLUSION: XNJI might be effective in cerebral ischemia by regulating oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction.},

The screening of the studies published was performed in 4 databases (PubMed-Web of Science-Lilacs-The Cochrane Library). Among the 1428 studies, only 20 studies had sufficient data to be included in the systematic review. Literature shows that ginger may have important effects on energy metabolism and obesity in animal models via decreased carbohydrate and lipids oxidation, increased nerve activity, changes in hormone (leptin, insulin) and enzymes (amylase, lipase). Some human studies also show positive effects; however, the results are conflicting because of difference in active ingredients, low dose, and short administration period (single dose, 24 hours). In meta-analysis of studies showed that ginger significantly decrease BMI (95\% CI:1.33 -4.02 to 1.84, p=.003). In conclusion, the association of ginger with energy metabolism and obesity may have positive effects.

The datasets for rhesus macaques exposure to mixed neutron:gamma radiation are used herein as a species comparative reference to the canine database. The selection of data cohorts was made from the following sources: Ovid Medline (1957-present), PubMed (1954-present), AGRICOLA (1976-present), Web of Science (1954-present), and US HHS RePORT (2002-present). The total number of hits across all search sites was 3,077. Several referenced, unpublished, non-peer reviewed government reports were unavailable for review. Primary published studies using canines, beagles, and mongrels were evaluated to provide an informative and consistent review of mixed neutron:gamma radiation effects to establish the DRRs for the H-ARS. Secondary and tertiary studies provided additional information on the hematologic response or the effects on hematopoietic progenitor cells, radiation dosimetry, absorbed dose, and organ dose. The LD50/30 values varied with neutron quality, exposure aspect, and mixed neutron:gamma ratio. The reference radiation quality varied from 250 kVp or 1-2 MeV x radiation and Co gamma radiation. A summary of a published review of a data set describing the DRR in rhesus macaques for mixed neutron:gamma radiation exposure in the H-ARS is included for a comparative reference to the canine dataset. The available evidence provided a reliable and extensive database that characterized the DRR for the H-ARS in canines and young rhesus macaques exposed to mixed neutron:gamma radiations of variable energy relative to 250 kVp, 1-2 MeV x radiation and Co gamma, and uniform and non-uniform total-body irradiation without the benefit of medical management. The mixed neutron:gamma radiation showed an energy-dependent RBE of {\textasciitilde} 1.0 to 2.0 relative to reference radiation exposure within both species. A marginal database described the DRR for the gastrointestinal (GI)-ARS. Medical management showed benefit in both species relative to the mixed neutron:gamma as well as exposure to reference radiation. The DRR for the H-ARS was characterized by steep slopes and relative LD50/30 values that reflected the radiation quality, exposure aspect, and dose rate over a range in time from 1956-2012.},

	abstract = {The 2013 global farmed shrimp production totalled 4.3 million tons, whereas the production of Litopenaeus vannamei as non-native species represented the 64\% of that amount. The risks of introducing non-native or exotic species are a growing environmental concern. Therefore, the objective of this study was to discuss updated information about the introduction of non-native species and to evaluate the efficiency indicators of non-native species in contrast to native ones. The results of a systematic revision of the publications about shrimp farming are presented, comparing the zootechnical performance of native and non-native species, with the use of meta-analysis tools. The conducted search returned 4680 results, corresponding to the articles that included one of the criteria previously established by the present work. Seven publications, which included 22 studies, met the requirements for the meta-analysis. The effect size calculated was positive, meaning that, according to the considered data, the use of non-native species resulted generally in higher values of growth rate in relation to the native species observed. Other aspects like the emergence and dissemination of the main viral diseases affecting global shrimp farming were also revised. We conclude that, although the advantages of using non-native species, especially L. vannamei, over native species are clear, there are enough compelling evidences to support the viability of small-scale native species farming. We also discussed why big companies, governments and associations related to the production and commerce of farmed shrimp should finance and support the development of native species farming.},

	abstract = {In general, bone fractures are able of healing by itself. However, in critical situations such as large bone defects, poor blood supply or even infections, the biological capacity of repair can be impaired, resulting in a delay of the consolidation process or even in non-union fractures. Thus, technologies able of improving the process of bone regeneration are of high demand. In this context, ceramic biomaterials-based bone substitutes and photobiomodulation (PBM) have been emerging as promising alternatives. Thus, the present study performed a systematic review targeting to analyze studies in the literature which investigated the effects of the association of ceramic based bone substitutes and PBM in the process of bone healing using animal models of bone defects. The search was conducted from March and April of 2019 in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases. After the eligibility analyses, 16 studies were included in this review. The results showed that the most common material used was hydroxyapatite (HA) followed by Biosilicate associated with infrared PBM. Furthermore, 75\% of the studies demonstrated positive effects to stimulate bone regeneration from association of ceramic biomaterials and PBM. All studies used low-level laser therapy (LLLT) device and the most studies used LLLT infrared. The evidence synthesis was moderate for all experimental studies for the variable histological analysis demonstrating the efficacy of techniques on the process of bone repair stimulation. In conclusion, this review demonstrates that the association of ceramic biomaterials and PBM presented positive effects for bone repair in experimental models of bone defects.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this up-to-date comprehensive systematic review was to evaluate and summarize all research studies in the field in order to clarify the magnitude of Nigella sativa (N. sativa) effects on the management of Diabetes mellitus (DM) and its complications. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in a Cochrane style and in accordance PRISMA checklist using the published studies in PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and EMBASE databases that were searched up to January 2019. Abstracts that met PICO criteria for qualitative studies underwent dual review for data extraction to evaluate study quality and details. RESULTS: Dietary supplementation with N. sativa preparations can improve various secondary complications of diabetic patients. N. sativa preparations possess antidiabetic, hypoglycemic, anti-hyperlipidemic, antihypertensive, and anti-obesity effects. Beneficial effects of N. sativa preparations include the restoration of the antioxidant defense systems, the increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes, the decrease of inflammatory biomarkers, the suppression of the production pro-inflammatory mediators, improvement of endothelial dysfunction, and hepatic, kidney, heart and immune system functions. They have key roles in managing diabetes-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. CONCLUSION: N. sativa preparations have key roles in herbal medicine as an adjuvant in the treatment and management of patients with DM and its complications. Moreover, the beneficial effects of N. sativa preparations were differently based on dosage forms, active ingredients, and duration of intervention. The best dosage to improve glycemic indices and lipid and lipoprotein profiles is 2 g daily powdered N. sativa for at least 12 weeks.},

The most common and presumed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detected in the Growth Differentiation Factor 9 gene is c.1189G{\textgreater}A (rs637044681, Ensembl) which results in an altered sequence of the encoded protein. In some studies, there was no effect of this SNP on litter size, while in other studies there was an effect. In the present study there was a meta-analysis conducted by pooling results from 11 eligible published studies to investigate effects of c.1189G{\textgreater}A polymorphism on litter size using four different genetic models including dominant (AA + AG compared with GG), recessive (AA compared with AG + GG), additive (AA compared with GG) and co-dominant (AA + GG compared with AG). Data were analyzed using fixed and random-effect models based on the I-squared value. Results indicate the c.1189G{\textgreater}A polymorphism is positively associated with litter size with use of the dominant model (SMD = 0.093, 95\% CI = 0.028 to 0.158, P-Value = 0.005). There, however, was no effect of the c.1189G{\textgreater}A polymorphism using the recessive (SMD = 0.065, 95\% CI = -0.164 to 0.295, P-Value = 0.577), additive (SMD = 0.172, 95\% CI = -0.169 to 0.513, P-Value = 0.324) and co-dominant (SMD = -0.083, 95\% CI = -0.200 to 0.034, P-Value = 0.164) genetic models. Results from use of the sensitivity analysis indicate the GG genotype affect litter size with use of the additive model (P {\textless} 0.01).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Echinococcosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the larval stages of taeniid cestodes of the genus Echinococcus. The two major types of infection in humans are cystic echinococcosis (CE) or hydatidosis and alveolar echinococcosis (AE). It is endemic in some parts of the world, such as the Middle East, with Iran being a part of it. This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to determine the prevalence of CE and AE echinococcosis and their epidemiological and clinical aspects in Iran. METHODS: Electronic databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), SCOPUS, Web of Science, SID and Mag Iran (two Persian scientific search engines) were searched from 1 January 1990 to 8 August 2017. The prevalence of CE and AE echinococcosis was estimated using the random effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was evaluated by subgroup analysis. Data were analyzed by STATA version 12. RESULTS: Of the 2051 records identified in the mentioned electronic databases, Seventy-eight articles met our eligibility criteria, with a total of 214124individuals. The meta-analysis was performed on only 37 out of 78 included studies. The pooled prevalence of CE and AE in Iran was 5\% [95\% confidence interval )CI(: 3-6\%] and 2\% [95\% CI: 0-5\%], respectively. Subgroup meta-analysis revealed that the prevalence of CE was significantly higher in North [9\%, 95\% CI: 4-18\%] and West of Iran [6\%, 95\% CI: 3-11\%], patients younger than 40 years of age [7\%, 95\% CI: 4-12\%], villagers and nomads [6\%, 95\% CI: 2-12\%], and studies that used the combination of serological, clinical, and imaging diagnostic methods [7\%, 95\% CI: 5-9\%]. There were no significant differences between the prevalence of CE among low and high-quality studies. Housewives were the most affected group by hydatidosis (n=24/77, 31\%), followed by illiterate people (n=11/77, 14\%) and farmers (n= 9/77, 12\%). Liver [55\%, 95\% CI: 46-65\%] and lung [28\%, 95\% CI, 22-35\%] were the most common sites of cyst formation. CONCLUSIONS: Given to the importance of echinococcosis on human health and domestic animals industry, it is necessary to implement monitoring and control measures in this regard.},

A systematic search was carried out using three databases with key words "Animal models", "Imaging", "Lung disease", and "Drugs". A total of 5749 articles were found, and, based on inclusion criteria, 284 papers were selected for final data extraction, resulting in 182 out of the 284 papers, based on eligibility. Twelve different animal species occurred and nine various imaging modalities were used, with two-thirds of the studies being longitudinal. The inducing agents and exposure (dose and duration) differed from non-physiological to clinically relevant doses. The majority of studies reported other biomarkers and/or histological confirmation of the imaging results. Summary of radiotracers and examples of imaging biomarkers were summarized, and the types of animal models and the most used imaging modalities and applications are discussed in this review.

Together with glucosinolate hydrolysis products (GSHPs), they have recently gained much attention due to their biological activities and mechanisms of action. We review herein the health benefits of GSs/GSHPs, approaches to improve the plant contents, their bioavailability and bioactivity. In this review, only literature published between 2010 and March 2020 was retrieved from various scientific databases. Findings indicate that these compounds (natural, pure, synthetic, and derivatives) play an important role in human/animal health (disease therapy and prevention), plant health (defense chemicals, biofumigants/biocides), and food industries (preservatives). Overall, much interest is focused on in vitro studies as anti-cancer and antimicrobial agents. GS/GSHP levels improvement in plants utilizes mostly biotic/abiotic stresses and short periods of phytohormone application. Their availability and bioactivity are directly proportional to their contents at the source, which is affected by methods of food preparation, processing, and extraction. This review concludes that, to a greater extent, there is a need to explore and improve GS-rich sources, which should be emphasized to obtain natural bioactive compounds/active ingredients that can be included among synthetic and commercial products for use in maintaining and promoting health. Furthermore, the development of advanced research on compounds pharmacokinetics, their molecular mode of action, genetics based on biosynthesis, their uses in promoting the health of living organisms is highlighted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is essential to further improve outcomes after liver transplantation (LT). Porcine isolated liver perfusion (ILP) is increasingly used to reproduce LT-associated IRI in a strictly controlled environment. However, whether ILP is a reliable substitute of LT was never validated. METHODS: We systematically reviewed the current experimental setups for ILP and parameters of interest reflecting IRI. RESULTS: Isolated liver perfusion was never compared with transplantation in animals. Considerable variability exists between setups, and comparative data are unavailable. Experience so far suggests that centrifugal pump(s) with continuous flow are preferred to reduce the risk of embolism. Hepatic outflow can be established by cannulation of the inferior vena cava or freely drained in an open bath. Whole blood at approximately 38°C, hematocrit of 20\% or greater, and the presence of leukocytes to trigger inflammation is considered the optimal perfusate. A number of parameters related to the 4 liver compartments (hepatocyte, cholangiocyte, endothelium, immune cells) are available; however, their significance and relation to clinical outcomes is not well described. CONCLUSIONS: Porcine ILP provides a reproducible model to study early IRI events. As all models, it has its limitations. A standardization of the setup would allow comparison of data and progress in the field.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anastomotic leak rates have not improved over several decades despite improvements in surgical techniques and patient care. The gut microbiome has been implicated in the development of leaks. The exact mechanisms by which tissue oxygenation affects gut microbial composition and anastomotic healing physiology are unclear. Also, commonly used carbon dioxide (CO(2)) is a known vasodilator that improves tissue oxygen tension. We performed a systematic review to determine the influence of hyperoxia, hypoxia, and hypercapnia on the gut microbiome and anastomotic healing. METHODS: A literature search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and COCHRANE to identify studies investigating the effects of hyperoxia, hypoxia, and hypercapnia on anastomotic healing and gut microbiota published between 1998 and 2018. Two reviewers screened the articles for eligibility and quality. Fifty-three articles underwent full text review, and a narrative synthesis was undertaken. RESULTS: Hyperoxia is associated with better anastomotic healing, increased gastrointestinal oxygen tension, and may reduce gut anaerobes. Hypoxia is associated with poor healing and increased gut anaerobes. However, it is unclear if hypoxia is the most important predictor of anastomotic leaks. Low pressure CO(2) pneumoperitoneum and mild systemic hypercapnia are both associated with increased gastrointestinal oxygen tension and may improve anastomotic healing. We found no studies which investigated the effect of hypercapnia on gut microbiota in the context of anastomotic healing. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue oxygenation influences gut anastomotic healing, but little evidence exists to demonstrate the influence on the gut microbiome in the context of healing. Further studies are needed to determine if anastomotic microbiome changes with altered tissue oxygenation and if this affects healing and leak rates. If confirmed, altering tissue oxygenation through hyperoxia or hypercapnia could be feasible means of altering the microbiome such that anastomotic leak rates reduce.},

Sequential treatment using diet, antimicrobials, and immunosuppressive drugs is the most common strategy used by clinicians. OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence for the effectiveness of dietary, drug, and alternative health interventions for inducing clinical remission in dogs and cats with CE. ANIMALS: Retrospective study of dogs and cats with a diagnosis of chronic enteropathy. METHODS: MEDLINE and Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (CABI) databases (1950 to March 2017) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and case series. The primary outcome was induction of clinical remission. All studies were evaluated using the quality of evidence grading guidelines (I-IV), which assign a score defining the strength and quality of the evidence. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies (11 RCTs in dogs and 2 in cats and 9 cohort studies or case series) met the inclusion criteria for inducing remission of gastrointestinal (GI) signs. Of the 13 RCTs achieving grade I scores, 10 studies (totaling 218 dogs and 65 cats) compared single treatment: diet (n = 3), immunosuppressives (n = 3), antimicrobials (n = 2), anti-inflammatory drugs (n = 1), and probiotics (n = 1). Three case series (grade III) reported clinical remission using an elimination diet fed to 55 cats and use of enrofloxacin to induce remission in dogs with granulomatous colitis (2 studies totaling 16 dogs). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The current evidence for treatment of CE is much greater in dogs than in cats. There is sufficient strong evidence to recommend the use of therapeutic GI diets, glucocorticoids, enrofloxacin, or some combination of these in dogs with CE. Therapeutic GI diets and glucocorticoids are most useful in cats with CE.},

Ibuprofen and loxoprofen did not show any significant effects on the rate of orthodontic tooth movement, whereas indomethacin, ketorolac, morphine, and high doses of etoricoxib were found to decrease it. Inconsistent or conflicting effects were noted after the administration of acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, celecoxib, meloxicam, and tramadol. The quality of the available evidence was considered at best as low. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term consumption of pain relievers may affect the rate of orthodontic tooth movement. The orthodontist should be capable of identifying patients taking pain relievers independently of orthodontic treatment and consider the possible implications.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Theoretically, root resorption could be modulated by any medication taken that exhibits possible effects on the implicated molecular pathways. OBJECTIVES: To systematically investigate and appraise the quality of the available evidence from animal studies, regarding the effect of commonly prescribed systemic medication on root resorption associated with orthodontic tooth movement. SEARCH METHODS: Search without restrictions in eight databases (PubMed, Central, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Arab World Research Source, ClinicalTrials.gov, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global) and hand searching until April 2018 took place. One author developed detailed search strategies for each database that were based on the PubMed strategy and adapted accordingly. SELECTION CRITERIA: Controlled studies investigating the effect of systemic medications on root resorption associated with orthodontic tooth movement. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Following study retrieval and selection, relevant data were extracted and the risk of bias was assessed using the SYRCLE's Risk of Bias Tool. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were finally identified, most of which at unclear risk of bias. Root resorption was shown to increase in Vitamin C treated animals in comparison with the control group, whereas a comparative decrease was noted after the administration of the alendronate, ibuprofen, growth hormone, low doses of meloxicam, simvastatin, lithium chloride and strontium ranelate. No difference was noted for acetaminophen, aspirin, fluoxetine, atorvastatin, misoprostol, zoledronic acid and zinc. Finally, inconsistent effects were observed after the administration of celecoxib, prednisolone and L-thyroxine. The quality of the available evidence was considered at best as low. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmaceutical substances investigated were shown to exhibit variable effects on root resorption. Although the overall quality of evidence provides the clinician with a cautious perspective on the strength of the relevant recommendations, good practice would suggest that it is important to identify patients consuming medications and consider the possible implications.

	abstract = {A healthy riparian ecosystem is essential to maintain instream water quality, decrease stream bank erosion, increase bank stability and prevent soil loss within river systems, which in turn may affect coastal water quality. The presence of cattle within the riparian zone is a common feature of grazing ventures, but can negatively impact on the functionality of riparian ecosystems. Therefore, the provision of offstream watering points (OSWPs) as an alternative watering source for cattle may lessen or prevent the impact cattle have on the riparian zone. A systematic review was conducted to identify: (1) which factors influence how cattle use OSWPs, and (2) if the provision of an OSWP is an effective best management practice to reduce the time cattle spent in riparian zones, potentially limiting the impact cattle may have on instream water quality and riparian habitat particularly stream bank vegetation. A total of 37 from 1135 research papers satisfied the initial selection criteria for the review with seven providing sufficient information to conduct a meta-analysis. Out of the 37 papers a total of seven factors and five sub-factors influencing cattle's use of OSWPs were identified. There is evidence that OSWPs did reduce the time cattle spent in riparian zones, however with great variation (63.7\%) among studies. The review further highlights that substantial knowledge gaps exist within the literature linking the interaction of cattle, OSWPs and riparian habitats indicating the need for further research.},

The reviewed literature showed that both Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica are present in East and Southern Africa, and infect a wide range of domestic and wild ruminants. Fasciola gigantica was reported in six East African and five Southern African countries, where Radix natalensis (found in low altitudes) was reported to be the main IH. Fasciola hepatica was reported in Tanzania and Ethiopia (East Africa), and in South Africa and Zimbabwe (Southern Africa), where Galba truncatula (found in high altitudes) was documented as the IH in all countries except in Zimbabwe. Both Fasciola species were documented in Tanzania, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. An overlap of the two was observed in areas with an intermediate altitude in Ethiopia and South Africa, where Pseudosuccinea columella was widespread and assumed to transmit both species. Pseudosuccinea columella has been reported in South Africa and Namibia, and proven to transmit F. gigantica in South Africa; its role in Namibia in the transmission of Fasciola species has not been reported. Other lymnaeid species such as R. rubiginosa were reported in South Africa, and R. auricularia in South Africa and Botswana; their role in the transmission of Fasciola species has not been proven. Future studies should aim to determine the role of P. columella in the geographical spread of the two species in East and Southern African countries.},

This biopolymer has been used in different pharmaceutical forms; therefore, it has an attractive potential for dermal applications in veterinary medicine. The aim of this review is to assess the healing potential of chitosan, based on its dermatological effects on animals, to enrich the therapeutic options of veterinary clinicians. A systematic review was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) strategy, retrieving 1,032 studies and selecting 39 after the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. The studies included reports with confirmed positive effects (n = 46/99, 46.5 \%) (P {\textless} 0.05), with positive effects (n = 49.5/99, 49.5 \%), and with no effect (n = 4/99, 4 \%); none of the studies reported adverse effects. There is an association between frequency of application and a decrease in healing time (P = 0.038); applying chitosan "every 48-72 hours" was the most recommended frequency (n = 10/19, 52.9 \%). Chitosan, when applied to skin lesions on animals, produces positive effects on healing, potentially becoming a safe biomaterial for skin treatments in veterinary practice. As an initial protocol, we suggest applying chitosan every 48-72 hours for at least 2 weeks (7 applications).},

Although a few studies have evaluated the prevalence of Toxoplasma oocysts in the soil of public places, the present study was conducted to provide insights into environmental contamination levels and its potential transmission to humans on a global scale. A systematic search was conducted using bibliographic databases through 30 August 2020. A random effects model was utilized to estimate pooled prevalence with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analysis and meta-regressions were also performed on the geographical and environmental parameters. Finally, 22 articles, wherein 15 420 soil samples were examined, met the systematic review and meta-analysis requirements. The mean pooled prevalence of Toxoplasma oocysts was estimated at 16\% (95\% CI 10 to 26) in public places. The estimated prevalences in Europe, South America, Asia and North America were 23\% (95\% CI 4 to 65), 22\% (95\% CI 18 to 26), 15\% (95\% CI 0.06 to 33) and 8\% (95\% CI 0.00 to 97), respectively. An increasing trend was observed in the prevalence of Toxoplasma oocysts with increasing latitude (41-56 degrees ), decreasing longitude (0-40 degrees ) and increasing relative humidity (76\%). Loop-mediated isothermal amplification and polymerase chain reaction methods revealed the highest and lowest prevalence rates, respectively, in the detection of Toxoplasma oocysts. Awareness of the health authorities and people about Toxoplasma prevalence in the soil of public places and its risk factors is of great importance to developing effective strategies to prevent infection.},

Milk consumption was not associated with the risk of osteoporosis (overall RR = 0.79; 95\% CI: 0.57-1.08). In non-linear dose-response meta-analysis, increase intake of dairy (at the level of 0 to 250 grams per day) was associated with a reduced risk of osteoporosis (P(nonlinearty) = 0.005). Meta-regression of included studies revealed an inverse linear association between dairy and milk intake and risk of osteoporosis; such that every additional 200-gram intake of dairy and milk was associated with a 22\% and 37\% reduced risk of osteoporosis, respectively. In terms of hip fracture, milk consumption was associated with a 25\% reduced risk of hip fracture only in cross-sectional and case-control studies (overall RR = 0.75; 95\%CI: 0.57-0.99). In linear meta-regression, every additional 200-gram milk intake per day was associated with a 9\% greater risk of hip fracture in cohort studies.Conclusion: Despite an inverse association between milk and dairy intake and risk of osteoporosis and hip fracture in cross-sectional and case-control studies, no such association was seen in cohort studies. Given the advantages of the cohort over case-control studies, we concluded that a greater intake of milk and dairy products was not associated with a lower risk of osteoporosis and hip fracture.},

	abstract = {In Vietnam, pork is the most commonly consumed type of meat, and the demand is expected to rise even further. Nevertheless, food safety is a major concern, as the country bears a high burden of food-borne diseases, including these caused by pork products. Knowledge of the flows of pigs and pork from producers up to the consumers is important; however, up to now, a comprehensive overview is lacking. We addressed this by conducting a systematic review on the pork value chain (PVC) mapping for the country. Four international and three Vietnamese databases were searched for data on the pork value chain in Vietnam, and the results were reported according to the PRISMA guidelines. Data obtained from the retained records showed that 10 main PVC types are present in Vietnam, comprising of five main actors including: producers, middlemen, slaughter men, retailers and consumers. Among the identified chains, the one involving producers, slaughter men, retailers and consumers is the most common one, with up to 75\% of pork following this route. In cities or export routes to other countries, middlemen and/or traders are important additional actors in the PVCs. The small scale of PVC linkages is prominent. The presence of middlemen, pig traders and pork traders is contributing to further distribution of pork products in geographical terms. Transactions between actors in the traditional PVCs in Vietnam are characterized by the absence of official contracts; therefore, the linkages in the chains are loose and the origin of pork is not traceable. More industrial forms of PVCs are slowly developing; however, the traditional PVCs are still prevailing in Vietnam. The weak linkages between actors and poor hygienic practices in these chains form a risk to pork safety.},

The articles identified included randomised clinical trials, cross-sectional studies and case series. Outcomes were the percentage of newly formed bone, remaining graft particles and soft tissue in a follow-up at least of 5 months. The use of bovine bone graft (ABB) as a graft material in maxillary sinus elevation was evaluated in 9 studies. According to the quality assessment, 4 of the 9 studies were analysed and an arithmetic mean was performed showing the following results: newly formed bone (NFB 22.74\%), residual grafts (RG 29.36\%) and soft tissue percentage (SF 48.51\%). The use of equine bone matrix (EBM) was assessed in four different studies including an RCT, a cross-sectional study and two case series; a mean percentage calculated by the extracted data of the four studies was estimated with newly formed bone (NFB 44.51\%), residual grafts (RG 17.24\%) and soft tissue percentage (SF 36.62\%).

The importance of determining blood groups in dogs and cats is, therefore, well-known for reducing the risk of adverse reactions in the recipient blood caused by a "non-compatible" donor. This systematic review summarizes data from previously published reports and follows the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for systematic reviews. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, we identified 41 eligible studies using different states and blood-typing methods to determine blood groups in dogs. The dog blood groups that were identified between 1999 and 2020 in 17 different countries were combined to yield the DEA (Dog Erythrocyte Antigen), Kai, and Dal groups. These studies were conducted in Europe, America, Africa, and Asia but not in all the countries of these continents. The methods used to determine blood types have also changed over the years. This systematic review highlights gaps in the literature and should advance future studies synthesizing data with methodological rigor.},

AIM: To develop a synthesis of the available evidence regarding genotypes of E. granulosus verified in humans worldwide. METHODS: Systematic review. Articles related with genotypes of E. granulosus, in humans, without language neither genotyped method restriction, published between 1990-2019 were included. A systematic in WoS, EMBASE, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Trip Database, BIREME, SciELO, LILACS, IBECS, and PAHO-WHO was carried out. In study variables were year of publication, country, number of samples, host and parasite organs, genotype identified, molecular marker and genes. Descriptive statistics were applied. RESULTS: 701 related articles were identified; 62 fulfilled selection criteria, representing 1,511 samples. The existing evidence was published between 1994 and 2019; and mainly comes from Iran (45.2\%). The most commonly used sequencing method was PCR amplification and Sanger type sequencing with partial or total genotyping of the cox1 gene. Genotyped method most frequently used was cox1 (79,0\%). Genotypes most frequently identified were G1 and G1/G3 complex (49.1\% and 32.2\%). CONCLUSIONS: Publications related to genotypes of Eg in humans are scarce, heterogeneous, and presenting differing results. Eg G1/G3 accounts for most of the global burden worldwide.},

To analyze how parameter choice affects the relevance and comparability of findings, we systematically reviewed 765 experimental studies of in vivo animal SAH models (2000-2014). During the last decade, we found marked increases in publications using smaller species and models for simulating acute events after SAH. Overall, the fewer types of species and models used did not correlate with an increased standardization in the experimental characteristics and procedures. However, by species, commonly applied, reliable parameters for each experimental SAH technique were identified in mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog models. Our findings can serve as a starting point for discussion toward a more uniform performance of SAH experiments, development of preclinical SAH common data elements, and establishment of standardized protocols for multicenter preclinical trials.},

This systematic review aims to summarize and categorize extracranial aneurysm models and their characteristics, discuss advantages and disadvantages, and suggest the best use of each model. We searched the electronical Medline/PubMed database between 1950 and 2020 to identify main models and their refinements and technical modifications for creation of extracranial aneurysms. Each study included was assessed for aneurysm-specific characteristics, technical details of aneurysm creation, and histological findings. Among more than 4000 titles and abstracts screened, 473 studies underwent full-text analysis. From those, 68 different techniques/models in five different species were identified, analyzed in detail, and then grouped into one of the five main groups of experimental models as sidewall, terminal, stump, bifurcation, or complex aneurysm models. This systematic review provides a compact guide for investigators in selecting the most appropriate model from a range of techniques to best suit their experimental goals, practical considerations, and laboratory environment.},

In general, APCs' adjunct positively affected bone regeneration. Animal species, platelet and growth factors concentration, type of bone defect and of platelet concentrate used seemed to influence their efficacy in bone healing. However, sound conclusions were not drawn since too few studies for each large-size animal model were included. In addition, characterization of APCs' content was performed only in a few studies.

	abstract = {Background: The control of vector-borne diseases (VBD) is one of the greatest challenges on the global health agenda. Rapid and uncontrolled urbanization has heightened the interest in addressing these challenges through an integrated vector management (IVM) approach. The aim was to identify components related to impacts, economic evaluation, and sustainability that might contribute to this integrated approach to VBD prevention. Main body We conducted a scoping review of available literature (2000-2016) using PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, CINAHL, Econlit, LILACS, Global Health Database, Scopus, and Embase, as well as Tropical Diseases Bulletin, WHOLIS, WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme, and Google Scholar. MeSH terms and free-text terms were used. A data extraction form was used, including TIDieR and ASTAIRE. MMAT and CHEERS were used to evaluate quality. Of the 42 documents reviewed, 30 were focused on dengue, eight on malaria, and two on leishmaniasis. More than a half of the studies were conducted in the Americas. Half used a quantitative descriptive approach (n=21), followed by cluster randomized controlled trials (n=11). Regarding impacts, outcomes were: (a) use of measures for vector control; (b) vector control; (c) health measures; and (d) social measures. IVM reduced breeding sites, the entomology index, and parasite rates. Results were heterogeneous, with variable magnitudes, but in all cases were favourable to the intervention. Evidence of IVM impacts on health outcomes was very limited but showed reduced incidence. Social outcomes were improved abilities and capacities, empowerment, and community knowledge. Regarding economic evaluation, only four studies performed an economic analysis, and intervention benefits outweighed costs. Cost-effectiveness was dependent on illness incidence. The results provided key elements to analyze sustainability in terms of three dimensions (social, economic, and environmental), emphasizing the implementation of a community-focused eco-bio-social approach. Conclusions: IVM has an impact on reducing vector breeding sites and the entomology index, but evidence of impacts on health outcomes is limited. Social outcomes are improved abilities and capacities, empowerment, and community knowledge. Economic evaluations are scarce, and cost-effectiveness is dependent on illness incidence. Community capacity building is the main component of sustainability, together with collaboration, institutionalization, and routinization of activities. Findings indicate a great heterogeneity in the interventions and highlight the need for characterizing interventions rigorously to facilitate transferability.},

The Animal Research Reporting In Vivo Experiment (ARRIVE) guidelines was used to assess the quality of the included studies. RESULTS: Nine studies have met the inclusion criteria and subjected to quality evaluation. All the defects (N = 156) were located in the mandible. Only 2 articles showed randomized controlled studies, whereas the remaining 7 were nonrandomized controlled studies. The geometry of the defects was either rectangular, box, cylindrical (circular), arch, or saddle shaped. CONCLUSION: There is a lack of homogeneity in reporting data on CSDs in the dog mandible. Future animal studies should include a negative control group for an objective comparison and evaluation of any new biomedical materials. More awareness is needed for the Animal Research Reporting In Vivo Experiment (ARRIVE) guidelines to improve data reporting, which can facilitate comparison and reproducibility of future studies.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to estimate the productive and economic impacts caused by the withdrawal of antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) from broilers diet. Indexed publications that compared diets with or without AGP (AGP+/AGP-) for broilers (from initial to final phase) were collected and the results of feed intake, weight gain, and feed conversion were compiled in a database. A meta-analysis was performed following sequential analyses: graphical approach (to observe biological data coherence), correlation (to identify related factors), and variance-covariance (to compare groups). The annual number of broiler slaughtered in Brazil, target weight gain and feed conversion for each phase, the variation in feed conversion, feed cost, and AGP costs were used to build a model to estimate the effects of the AGP withdrawal on feeding costs. The database comprised 174 scientific articles containing 183 experiments, totaling 121,643 broilers, most of which were Ross (52\% of the studies). The most frequent AGP sources/forms in the database were Avilamycin (41\% of the AGP+ treatments), Flavomycin (19\%), Virginiamycin (16\%), and Bacitracin (14\%). Higher feed intake, weight gain, and lower feed conversion were attributed (P {\textless} 0.05) to AGP+ diets during Initial phase (1 to 21 D). In Final phase (22 to 42 D) no differences were observed in performance variables. Treatments AGP+ presented higher weight gain and better feed conversion in the Total period (1 to 42 D). The results of feed conversion were improved (P {\textless} 0.05) with Avilamycin and Flavomycin; Virginiamycin improved weight gain and feed conversion. In the Total period, the economic impact was \$0.03 per animal and a total of \$183,560,232 per year. It was concluded that broilers fed AGP+ diets have higher weight gain and better feed conversion than those fed AGP- diets, and withdrawing AGP increases production costs.},

However, the form and quality of the studies varied considerably. It was concluded that further research is needed, particularly for those with younger onset dementia (YOD), for whom there were no specific studies available. Attention needs to be given to establishing adequate-sized samples and designs incorporating control groups. Research would benefit from employing mixed-methods, allowing for the triangulation of qualitative and quantitative data. For deteriorating conditions such as the dementias, studies need to be conducted over time. Furthermore, given the important place family members play in the lives of those with dementia, the effects of dog-assisted interventions on the wider family should also be considered.},

	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is among the most prevalent diseases in the world, affecting over 420 million people. The disease is marked by a poor metabolic effect of insulin leading to chronic hyperglycaemia, which can result in microvascular complications. It is widely known that postprandial glycaemia is reliant on the total carbohydrate content of a meal. However, the importance of the amount and the source of these carbohydrates remains controversial due to mechanisms other than insulin secretion. Oxidative stress, inflammation, pyruvate production and the quality of the intestinal microbiota, resulting in plasma lipopolysaccharides and short-chain fatty acids production, play an important role in blood sugar control and consequently in type 2 diabetes. Thus, we systematically reviewed the preclinical evidences on the impact of the amount and type of carbohydrate found in different diets and its influence on blood glucose levels in diabetic animals. We used a comprehensive and structured search in biomedical databases Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Web of Science, recovering and analyzing 27 original studies. Results showed that sucrose-rich diets deteriorated diabetic condition in animal models regardless of the total dietary carbohydrate content. On the other hand, fiber, particularly resistant starch, improved blood glucose parameters through direct and indirect mechanisms, such as delayed gastric emptying and improved gut microbiota. All studies used rodents as animal models and male animals were preferred over females. Improvements in T2DM parameters in animal models were more closely related to the type of dietary carbohydrate than to its content on a diet, i. e., resistant starch seems to be the most beneficial source for maintaining normoglycemia. Results show that current literature is at high risk of bias due to neglecting experimental methods.},

	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is among the most prevalent metabolic diseases in the world and may result in several long-term complications. The crosstalk between gut microbiota and host metabolism is closely related to T2DM. Currently, fragmented data hamper defining the relationship between probiotics and T2DM. This systematic review aimed at investigating the effects of probiotics on T2DM in animal models. We systematically reviewed preclinical evidences using PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases, recovering 24 original articles published until September 27th, 2019. This systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. We included experimental studies with animal models reporting the effects of probiotics on T2DM. Studies were sorted by characteristics of publications, animal models, performed analyses, probiotic used and interventions. Bias analysis and methodological quality assessments were examined through the SYRCLE's Risk of Bias tool. Probiotics improved T2DM in 96\% of the studies. Most studies (96\%) used Lactobacillus strains, and all of them led to improved glycaemia. All studies used rodents as models, and male animals were preferred over females. Results suggest that probiotics have a beneficial effect in T2DM animals and could be used as a supporting alternative in the disease treatment. Considering a detailed evaluation of the reporting and methodological quality, the current preclinical evidence is at high risk of bias. We hope that our critical analysis will be useful in mitigating the sources of bias in further studies.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the association between the bird-beak configuration (BBC), a wedge-shaped gap between the undersurface of a thoracic endograft and the lesser curvature of the arch after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), and postoperative outcome after TEVAR. Methods: The study was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. The PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched to identify all case series reporting BBC after TEVAR between 2006 and April 2018. Data analysis was performed considering the difference in the risk of complications for presence vs absence of BBC. After screening 1633 articles, 21 studies were identified that matched the selection criteria; 12 of these reported detailed information to investigate the postoperative outcome using proportion meta-analysis with a random effects model. The pooled risk difference is reported with the 95\% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity of the included studies was assessed with the I(2) statistic (low 25\%, medium 50\%, high 75\%). Results: Complications occurred within a range of 0 to 72 months in 14.7\% (95\% CI 7.4\% to 27.3\%) of patients with BBC and in 6.3\% (95\% CI 2.5\% to 15.4\%) of patients without BBC. A cumulative incidence could not be assessed. The summary risk difference was 11.1\% (95\% CI -0.1\% to 22.3\%, p=0.052). There was significant heterogeneity (I(2)=85.6\%). The Egger test did not show evidence of publication bias (p=0.975). When specifically considering type Ia endoleak and endograft migration, the risk difference between BBC and non-BBC patients was 8.2\% (95\% CI 0.3\% to 16.1\%, p=0.042; I(2)=69.0\%). The specific risk difference for endograft collapse/infolding and thrombosis was 3.7\% (95\% CI -3.5\% to 11.1\%, p=0.308; I(2)=10.2\%). Conclusion: At present the literature does not provide statistical evidence to establish an overall prognostic value of the BBC. Nevertheless, the BBC appears to be associated with a high risk of type Ia endoleak and endograft migration, which warrants specific and long-term surveillance. Clinically relevant values for BBC grading should be established to perhaps define indications for preemptive treatment based on the presence of BBC only.},

The descriptors used were related to T. gondii infection and behavioral outcomes in humans; the main databases of the medical literature were accessed. The results of eight original articles published between 1994 and 2016 were evaluated and described. The most common serological method was the enzyme immunoassay. Most of the researchers used validated instruments for behavioral evaluation. Seven studies reported some association between the prevalence of anti-T. gondii antibodies and some altered behavioral aspects in adult humans; these studies focused on adult population in Europe and the USA. The most reported behavioral deviations are related to greater impulsivity and aggressiveness. There are very few studies on this subject, which present some limitations for inference and conclusions: most were cross-sectional studies, with a small sample size and in similar populations. Investigations with a larger sample size of different population groups should be performed to evaluate multiple factors.},

Animal models are essential for understanding autophagy regulation and identifying new treatments to modulate its effects. A systematic review (SR) was conducted of studies employing animal models for investigations of autophagy in corneal diseases. Studies were identified using a structured search strategy (TS = autophagy AND cornea*) in Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed from inception to September 2019. In this study, 230 articles were collected, of which 28 were analyzed. Mouse models were used in 82\% of the studies, while rat, rabbit, and newt models were used in the other 18\%. The most studied corneal layer was the epithelium, followed by the endothelium and stroma. In 13 articles, genetically modified animal models were used to study Fuch endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), granular corneal dystrophy type 2 (GCD2), dry eye disease (DED), and corneal infection. In other 13 articles, animal models were experimentally induced to mimic DED, keratitis, inflammation, and surgical scenarios. Furthermore, in 50\% of studies, modulators that activated or inhibited autophagy were also investigated. Protective effects of autophagy activators were demonstrated, including rapamycin for DED and keratitis, lithium for FECD, LYN-1604 for DED, cysteamine and miR-34c antagomir for damaged corneal epithelium. Three autophagy suppressors were also found to have therapeutic effects, such as aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-riboside (AICAR) for corneal allogeneic transplantation, celecoxib and chloroquine for DED.},

	abstract = {Both in Europe and worldwide cheese has caused important outbreaks of listeriosis and can be a vehicle for transmission of Listeria monocytogenes to consumers. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using scientific literature and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reports to summarize available data on the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in different types of cheeses produced in Europe. Meta-analysis models were used to estimate mean prevalence of the pathogen and to compare prevalence among types of cheeses (fresh, ripened, veined, smear and brined) and cheeses produced using, respectively, pasteurized or un-pasteurized milk. Data from a total of 130,604 samples were analysed. Mean prevalence for presence during 2005-2015 estimated from scientific literature (2.3\% with confidence interval (CI): 1.4-3.8\%) was more than three times higher than results from EFSA reports (0.7\%; CI: 0.5-1.1\%). The prevalence differed among types of cheeses including fresh (0.8\%; CI: 0.3-1.9\%), ripened (2.0\%; CI: 0.8-4.9\%), veined (2.4\%; CI: 0.9-6.3\%), smear (5.1\%; CI: 1.9-13.1\%) and brined (11.8\%; CI: 3.5-33.3\%). Mean prevalence of L. monocytogenes in soft/semi-soft cheeses were not significantly different (P {\textgreater}0.05) for cheeses produced from pasteurized (0.9\%; CI: 0.4-1.9\%) or un-pasteurized (1.0\%; CI: 0.4-2.2\%) milk. For cheese samples reported by EFSA 0.2\% CI: 0.1-0.4\% had concentration of L. monocytogenes above the critical European limits of 100 cfu/g. In addition, this systematic review focused on groups/species of microorganisms suitable as indicator organisms for L. monocytogenes in cheeses to reflect the level of production hygiene or as index organisms to assess the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in cheeses. However, no suitable indicator or index organisms were identified. The performed meta-analyses improved our understanding of L. monocytogenes prevalence in different types of cheeses and provided results that can be useful as input for quantitative microbiological risk assessment modelling.},

	abstract = {We performed a systematic review to identify and summarize the effects of distinctive aerobic exercise (AE) protocols on chronic allergic lung inflammation reported in asthma animal models. We identified 255 preclinical studies of asthma and AE protocols by comprehensive searches in PubMed, ScienceDirect and LILACS for peer-reviewed journals, using the search components "exercise," "lung inflammation," and "asthma," without restrictions on publication date. Twenty-two studies were selected that met all eligibility criteria. Most studies used an ovalbumin experimental model and performed experiments with BALB/c mice. Most studies performed treadmill AE, using protocols of 30 to 60 minutes, 3 to 5 times/week, for 4 to 8 weeks. The results showed that the effects of AE on lungs were protocol dependent, but generaly, there was a decrease in inflammatory cell influx and Th2 cytokines, as well as an increase in anti-inflammatory defenses. However, the immunoregulation of globulins and nitric oxide levels in asthma seemed to be associated with the onset of AE. The results suggest that AE plays an important immunoregulatory role in animal models of asthma, with effects mainly mediated by increased anti-inflammatory defenses and reduced Th2 response. In parallel, prophylactic and therapeutic AE also played important roles in decreasing bronchial responsiveness and attenuating lung remodeling in animal models of asthma, secondary outcomes in this systematic review. The review protocol was published for free access in October 2017 on the Systematic Review Facility (SyRF) platform (http://syrf.org.uk/protocols/).},

Twenty-eight articles that fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria established were analysed. Studies suggest there is a specific deficiency of endocannabinoids in the periphery during CINP. Inhibitors of FAAH and MGL, enzymes that degrade the endocannabinoids, CB receptor agonists, desipramine, and coadministered indomethacin plus minocycline were found to either prevent the development and/or attenuate established CINP in a CB receptor-dependent manner. The studies analysed suggest that targeting the endocannabinoid system for prevention and treatment of CINP is a plausible therapeutic option. Almost 90\% of the studies on animal models of CINP analysed utilised male rodents.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Guidelines regarding the impact and value of prophylaxis or maintenance therapy in equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS) are not well-established or defined. The merits and the magnitude of effects of prophylaxis for spontaneous or recurrent squamous gastric ulceration in horses in training are uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To pool data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to eliminate reporting bias and evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic omeprazole in the prevention of EGUS in training horses, and secondarily to compare prophylactic dosages of omeprazole. STUDY DESIGN: Meta-analysis. METHODS: This meta-analysis was conducted according to the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A systematic literature search identified RCTs comparing omeprazole prophylaxis with sham in prevention of EGUS. Data were analysed using the Mantel-Haenszel test method to calculate risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Primary outcome was efficacy of prophylaxis. Secondary outcome was endoscopic severity of ulceration. The influence of study characteristics on the outcomes was examined by subgroup analyses. RESULTS: In preventing gastric ulcer occurrence, omeprazole prophylaxis was superior to sham in training horses (7 trials, 566 horses, RR 0.28, 95\% CI 0.18-0.43; 23.4\% in omeprazole prophylaxis vs. 77.2\% in sham; high quality evidence). Prevalence of ulceration was 75.3 and 87.2\% in the sham arms of the 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg omeprazole groups, respectively. Severity scores were significantly lower for omeprazole vs. sham (mean difference [MD] -1.05; 95\% CI -1.35 to -0.69). Subgroup analyses comparing prophylactic omeprazole dosages resulted in a mean difference of -0.94 and -1.60 for the 1 and 2 mg/kg groups, respectively. MAIN LIMITATIONS: Studies showed heterogeneity with regard to prophylactic dose. CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole prophylaxis in active training horses significantly reduces gastric ulceration compared with no prophylaxis (sham) with the absolute effect of 566 fewer ulcers per 1000 horses treated.},

METHODS: The search was performed using seven international databases including Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and EMBASE up to 11 October 2018. Random effects model was used to determine the pooled seroprevalence of T. gondii infection with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) and analyzed data from four continents. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were also performed according to continent and gender. RESULTS: In total, 42 studies out of 3517 published articles involving 14,542 camels from 17 countries were included for the final analyses. The global pooled seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in the Camelidae family was 28.16\% (95\% CI 23.64-32.68\%). Besides, the highest seroprevalence rate was in Europe (49.64\%) followed by Africa (37.63\%), America (21.76\%), and Asia (17.58\%). Moreover, the overall seroprevalence rates of T. gondii infection were 22\% (95\% CI 10-33\%) and 15\% (95\% CI 9-22\%) for the females and males, respectively. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis showed a high seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in camelids as these animals play an important role in the transmission cycle of this zoonotic disease.},

	abstract = {Energy metabolism has received much attention as a potential driver of repeatable among-individual differences in behaviour (animal personality). Several factors have been hypothesized to mediate this relationship. We performed a systematic review with a meta-analysis of {\textgreater}70 studies comprised of {\textgreater}8000 individuals reporting relationships between measures of maintenance metabolic rates (i.e. basal metabolic rate, resting metabolic rate, and standard metabolic rate) and behaviour. We evaluated support for three hypothesized mediators: (i) type of behaviour, (ii) opportunities for energy re-allocation, and (iii) magnitude of energetic constraints. Relationships between measures of maintenance metabolic rate (MR) and behaviour are predicted to be strongest for behaviours with strong consequences for energy turnover (acquisition or expenditure). Consistent with this, we found that behaviours with known consequences for energy gain (e.g. foraging, dominance, boldness) or expenditure (e.g. maximum sprint speed, sustained running speed, maximum distance travelled, etc.) had strong positive correlations with MR, while behaviours with putatively weak and/or inconsistent associations with net energy gain or loss (e.g. exploration, activity, sociability) were not correlated with MR. Greater opportunities for energy reallocation are predicted to weaken relationships between MR and behaviour by creating alternative pathways to balance energy budgets. We tested this by contrasting relationships between MR and behaviour in ectotherms versus endotherms, as thermoregulation in endotherms creates additional opportunities for energy reallocation compared with ectotherms. As predicted, the relationship between behaviour and MR was stronger in ectotherms compared with endotherms. However, statistical analyses of heterogeneity among effect sizes from different species did not support energy re-allocation as the main driver of these differences. Finally, we tested whether conditions where animals face greater constraints in meeting their energy budgets (e.g. field versus laboratory, breeding versus non-breeding) increased the strength of the relationship between MR and behaviour. We found that the relationship between MR and behaviour was unaffected by either of these modifiers. This meta-analysis provides two key insights. First, we observed positive relationships of similar magnitude between MR and behaviours that bring in net energy, and behaviours that cost net energy. This result is only consistent with a performance energy-management model. Given that the studies included in our meta-analysis represent a wide range of taxa, this suggests that the performance model may be the most common model in general. Second, we found that behaviours with putatively weak or inconsistent consequences for net energy gain or expenditure (exploration, activity, sociability) show no relationship with MR. The lack of relationship between MR and behavioural traits with weak and/or inconsistent consequences for energy turnover provides the first systematic demonstration of the central importance of the ecological function of traits in mediating relationships between MR and behaviour.},

	abstract = {Reducing meat consumption may improve human health, curb environmental damage, and limit the large-scale suffering of animals raised in factory farms. Most attention to reducing consumption has focused on restructuring environments where foods are chosen or on making health or environmental appeals. However, psychological theory suggests that interventions appealing to animal welfare concerns might operate on distinct, potent pathways. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of these interventions. We searched eight academic databases and extensively searched grey literature. We meta-analyzed 100 studies assessing interventions designed to reduce meat consumption or purchase by mentioning or portraying farm animals, that measured behavioral or self-reported outcomes related to meat consumption, purchase, or related intentions, and that had a control condition. The interventions consistently reduced meat consumption, purchase, or related intentions at least in the short term with meaningfully large effects (meta-analytic mean risk ratio [RR] = 1.22; 95\% CI: [1.13, 1.33]). We estimated that a large majority of population effect sizes (71\%; 95\% CI: [59\%, 80\%]) were stronger than RR = 1.1 and that few were in the unintended direction. Via meta-regression, we identified some specific characteristics of studies and interventions that were associated with effect size. Risk-of-bias assessments identified both methodological strengths and limitations of this literature; however, results did not differ meaningfully in sensitivity analyses retaining only studies at the lowest risk of bias. Evidence of publication bias was not apparent. In conclusion, animal welfare interventions preliminarily appear effective in these typically short-term studies of primarily self-reported outcomes. Future research should use direct behavioral outcomes that minimize the potential for social desirability bias and are measured over long-term follow-up.},

The aim of our study was to update the evidence regarding dairy intake, osteoporotic fracture (OF) risk, and prospective bone mass density (BMD) evolution assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in Europeans and non-Hispanic whites from North America. A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus for papers published from 1 January, 2000 to 30 April, 2018. The eligibility criteria were as follows: healthy adults; measurable dairy exposure; hip, vertebral, wrist or OF as outcomes; and cohort or case-control studies. Two independent investigators conducted the search and the data extraction. A pooled analysis was conducted with random-effects models. Publication bias and meta-regression were considered. Ten cohort studies relating to OF risk were selected for meta-analysis. Three papers reporting BMD changes associated with dairy intake could not be aggregated in the meta-analysis. The pooled HRs of the highest compared with the lowest levels of dairy intake were 0.95 (95\% CI: 0.87, 1.03; I2 = 82.9\%; P-heterogeneity {\textless} 0.001) for OF at any site; 0.87 (95\% CI: 0.75, 1.01; I2 = 86.7\%; P-heterogeneity {\textless} 0.001) for hip fractures; and 0.82 (95\% CI: 0.68, 0.99; I2 = 0.0\%; P-heterogeneity = 0.512) for vertebral fractures. Concerning BMD, the selected studies described a 1.7-3\% lower hip BMD in young and postmenopausal women with poor intake of milk in their youth, a positive relationship between baseline milk ingestion and the percentage of trochanter BMD change in elderly people, and a positive correlation between milk consumption and BMD change at the radius in women aged {\textgreater}65 y. In conclusion, in the studied population, the highest consumption of dairy products did not show a clear association with the total OF or hip fracture risks; however, a diminished risk of vertebral fracture could be described. The results regarding BMD change were heterogeneous and did not allow for a definitive conclusion.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Neglected zoonotic diseases (NZDs) have a significant impact on the livelihoods of the world's poorest populations, which often lack access to basic services. Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes are included among the key strategies for achieving the World Health Organization's 2020 Roadmap for Implementation for control of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). There exists a lack of knowledge regarding the effect of animals on the effectiveness of WASH measures. OBJECTIVES: This review looked to identify how animal presence in the household influences the effectiveness of water, hygiene and sanitation measures for zoonotic disease control in low and middle income countries; to identify gaps of knowledge regarding this topic based on the amount and type of studies looking at this particular interaction. METHODS: Studies from three databases (Medline, Web of Science and Global Health) were screened through various stages. Selected articles were required to show burden of one or more zoonotic diseases, an animal component and a WASH component. Selected articles were analysed. A narrative synthesis was chosen for the review. RESULTS: Only two studies out of 7588 met the inclusion criteria. The studies exemplified how direct or indirect contact between animals and humans within the household can influence the effectiveness of WASH interventions. The analysis also shows the challenges faced by the scientific community to isolate and depict this particular interaction. CONCLUSION: The dearth of studies examining animal-WASH interactions is explained by the difficulties associated with studying environmental interventions and the lack of collaboration between the WASH and Veterinary Public Health research communities. Further tailored research under a holistic One Health approach will be required in order to meet the goals set in the NTDs Roadmap and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.},

A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, Scopus and Medline databases. A quality assessment yielded a total of 83 papers to be considered for the review. A critical assessment of research papers indicated that cisplatin, CMF and MTX + 5-FU chemotherapy regimens produced strong deficits in short term memory, long term memory and executive control. An assessment of specific cognitive domains illustrated that short term memory was strongly impaired by chemotherapy treatment, often associated with impaired neurogenesis, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in the hippocampus.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The transmission of malaria is known to be sensitive to the survival (longevity, mortality) of its mosquito vector, yet there have been few reviews of estimates of this important population parameter in the malaria-carrying genus Anopheles. METHODS: We carried out a systematic search for and meta-analysis of survival estimates, framed around the methods of estimation, under the major groupings of ‛vertical' (based on stable age or stage frequencies), ‛horizontal' (based on recaptures of marked and released cohorts), and ‛parasitological' (proportion of infectious mosquitoes). Because of the intricacies of the estimation process we provide an outline of these methods. RESULTS: By meta-analysis we quantify the average of the distribution of daily survival [Formula: see text] for vertical (0.83, 95\% CI: 0.80-0.86), horizontal (0.73, 95\% CI: 0.66-0.79) and parasitological (0.92, 95\% CI: 0.86-0.95) methods. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis demonstrates the anticipated result that horizontal estimates are lowest because they estimate apparent survival (survival and non-emigration) rather than true survival. On the other hand, vertical methods make strong assumptions about the stability or stationarity of the underlying populations. Further potential sources of methodological bias are mentioned. The substantial differences in estimates between methods indicates that methodological biases need to be considered when making use of available survival estimates.},

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. ANIMALS: Client-owned or healthy research dogs. METHODS: A literature review was performed by using PubMed and CAB abstracts for English-language studies providing descriptions of complications related to laparoscopic and laparoscopic-assisted procedures in dogs. Study selection used PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Quality assessment was performed by using a MINORS (Methodological Items for Non-Randomized Studies) scoring system and a grading scale of level of evidence. Descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: In total, 741 manuscripts were identified, with 64 manuscripts eligible for data extraction and quality assessment. The most represented organ system was the female genital tract, represented by 22 (34.4\%) studies. The most commonly reported intraoperative and postoperative complications were related to abdominal entry and portal incisions, respectively. In 53 of 54 non-randomized studies, high risk of bias was found. Forty-eight (75\%) studies provided level III or IV evidence. CONCLUSION: This report provides an updated review of complications related to laparoscopic and laparoscopic-assisted procedures in dogs, classified by organ system. The overall quality of evidence was low, limiting direct comparison of complication rates between studies. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: There is a need for implementation of standardized criteria for defining complications, study time frames and greater numbers of high quality prospective randomized trials in veterinary laparoscopy to permit comparison of complication and conversion rates between published studies and across organ systems.},

Importantly, each of the individual post-injury cascades is characterized by complex and potentially opposing pathophysiological responses, complicating optimal resuscitation and therapeutic approaches. Large animal models of poly-neurotrauma closely mimic human physiology, but a systematic literature review of published models has been lacking. The current review suggests a relative paucity of large animal poly-neurotrauma studies (N = 52), with meta-statistics revealing trends for animal species (exclusively swine), characteristics (use of single biological sex, use of juveniles) and TBI models. Although most studies have targeted blood loss volumes of 35-45\%, the associated mortality rates are much lower relative to Class III/IV human trauma. This discrepancy may result from potentially mitigating experimental factors (e.g., mechanical ventilation prior to or during injury, pausing/resuming blood loss based on physiological parameters, administration of small volume fluid resuscitation) that are rarely associated with human trauma, highlighting the need for additional work in this area.},

Grazing swards consisting of herb species grown with either a grass species or a grass and legume (multispecies swards) were compared with non-herb-containing swards consisting of a grass species grown as a monoculture or grass-legume swards (simple swards). A literature search was completed using the online databases CAB Direct, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, using the search strategy "dairy cow", "herb OR forb OR phorb", and "grazing". Milk production data, variance, and sample size were required for eligibility. In all, 116 studies were identified. Following eligibility screening, 11 papers from 6 journals, published between 2006 and 2018, were available for analysis. Studies were from New Zealand (N = 7), Australia (N = 3), and the United States (N = 1). The population was either Holstein Friesian or Holstein Friesian × Jersey dairy cows, with a range in mean daily milk yield (MY) from 12.1 kg to 34.7 kg (mean = 18.6 kg). A total of 25 comparisons were used for milk production analysis, with 324 and 284 cows included in multispecies and simple sward groups respectively. Data analysis was conducted in R using a random effects, robust variance estimation model (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Heterogeneity was reported using the I(2) statistic. Milk production was significantly increased. Analysis of MY resulted in a weighted mean difference (WMD) of +1.20 kg/d (95\% CI = 0.90, 1.49; I(2) = 4\%). Fat and protein kg were also significantly increased (WMD +0.06 kg/d; CI = 0.01, 0.11). Urinary nitrogen excretion was estimated from milk urea nitrogen when reported (n = 6). A WMD of -28.1 g of N/d (95\% CI = -81.1, 24.9) was generated, with heterogeneity high among studies (I(2) = 75\%). This meta-analysis shows the potential benefits of multispecies swards.

	abstract = {Grazing can have considerable ecological impacts when managed inappropriately, however livestock production is a significant contributor to global food security and the removal of land from production is not always a viable option. Grazing management practices that incorporate periods of planned rest (i.e. strategic-rest grazing) may be an alternative to grazing exclusion or continuous grazing that could achieve ecological and animal production outcomes simultaneously. We conducted a meta-analysis of global literature to investigate how strategic-rest grazing mediates ecological (i.e., plant richness and diversity), biophysical (plant biomass and ground cover) and production response variables (animal weight gain and animal production per hectare) compared to continuously grazed or ungrazed areas. Overall, total ground cover and animal production per hectare were significantly greater under strategic-rest grazing than continuous grazing management, but biomass, plant richness, plant diversity and animal weight gain did not differ between grazing treatments. Increasing the length of rest relative to graze time under strategic-rest grazing was associated with an increase in plant biomass, ground cover, animal weight gain and animal production per hectare when compared to continuous grazing. Synthesis and applications. Understanding both the ecological and animal production trade-offs associated with different grazing management strategies is essential to make informed decisions about best-management practices for the world's grazing lands. We show that incorporating periods of rest into grazing regimes improves ground cover and animal production per hectare and that these benefits are more pronounced with increases in the length of time land is rested for. This extended rest also improves biomass production and weight gain compared to continuous grazing systems. Based on these meta-analyses, we recommend that future research considers the duration of rest compared to graze time in comparisons of grazing systems.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Placenta has a long history of use for treating burns and wounds. It is a rich source of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins, tissue reparative growth factors, and stem cells, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Recent data show its therapeutic potential for orthopaedic sports medicine indications. PURPOSE: To provide orthopaedic surgeons with an anatomic description of the placenta, to characterize its cellular composition, and to review the literature reporting the use of placenta-derived cells and placental tissue allografts for orthopaedic sports medicine indications in animal models and in humans. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: Using a total of 63 keyword combinations, the PubMed and MEDLINE databases were searched for published articles describing the use of placental cells and/or tissue for orthopaedic sports medicine indications. Information was collected on placental tissue type, indications, animal model, study design, treatment regimen, safety, and efficacy outcomes. Results were categorized by indication and subcategorized by animal model. RESULTS: Outcomes for 29 animal studies and 6 human studies reporting the use of placenta-derived therapeutics were generally positive; however, the placental tissue source, clinical indication, and administration route were highly variable across these studies. Fourteen animal studies described the use of placental tissue for tendon injuries, 13 studies for osteoarthritis or articular cartilage injuries, 3 for ligament injuries, and 1 for synovitis. Both placenta-derived culture-expanded cells (epithelial cells or MSCs) and placental tissue allografts were used in animal studies. In all human studies, commercial placental allografts were used. Five of 6 human studies examined the treatment of foot and ankle pathological conditions, and 1 studied the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. CONCLUSION: A review of the small number of reported studies revealed a high degree of variability in placental cell types, placental tissue preparation, routes of administration, and treatment regimens, which prohibits making any definitive conclusions. Currently, the clinical use of placenta is limited to only commercial placental tissue allografts, as there are no placenta-derived biological drugs approved for the treatment of orthopaedic sports medicine conditions in the United States. However, this review shows that the application of placental cells or tissue allografts appears to be safe and has potential to improve outcomes for orthopaedic sports medicine indications.},

	abstract = {The objective of this scoping review was to characterize all available literature on modifiable management practices used during the dry period that have been evaluated for their effects on udder health in dairy cattle during the dry period and the subsequent lactation. Five databases and two conference proceedings were searched for relevant literature. Articles published in or after 1990 were eligible for inclusion. Eligible interventions or exposures were restricted to modifiable management practices; however, antimicrobial and teat sealant products were enumerated but not further characterized, as systematic reviews have been published on this topic. Other modifiable management practices were reported in 229 articles. Nutrition (n = 79), which included ration formulation and delivery (n = 44) and vitamin and mineral additives (n = 35), was the most commonly reported practice, followed by vaccines (n = 40) and modification of dry period length (n = 27). Risk of clinical mastitis (CM) was the most commonly reported outcome (n = 151); however, reporting of outcome risk periods varied widely between articles. Cure of existing intramammary infections (IMI) over the dry period (n = 40) and prevention of new IMI over the dry period (n = 54) were most commonly reported with a risk period between calving and 30 d in milk. Future systematic reviews with meta-analyses could target management practices such as nutrition, vaccines, and dry period length to quantify their effects on improving udder health during the dry period and early lactation. However, the variation in reporting of time at risk for CM and other outcomes challenges the ability of future synthesis work to inform management decisions on the basis of efficacy to cure or prevent IMI and CM. Consensus on which core outcomes should be evaluated in mastitis research and the selection of consistent risk periods for specific outcomes in animal trials is imperative.},

	abstract = {Biological therapies that increase or suppress the expression of transcripts underlying atrial fibrillation (AF) progression are increasingly being explored to create novel treatment paradigms beyond simply suppressing or destroying tissue. To date, there has been no systematic overview of the preclinical evidence exploring manipulation of fundamental biological principles in the treatment of AF. As such, the objective of this study was to establish the effect of biological approaches used in the treatment of AF within large and small animals. We performed a systematic search using predefined terms, which yielded 25 studies. We determined the effect of biological approaches on primary efficacy outcomes and assessed the quality of included studies or possible bias in the treatment of AF. Compared with non-transduced or transduced controls, biological therapies reduced AF inducibility (85\% less AF; odds ratio 0.15; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.07-0.35; P {\textless} .01) and atrial scar burden (6.7\% smaller scars; 95\% CI 4.2-9.2; P {\textless} .01) or increased number of days in sinus rhythm (6.4 more days in sinus rhythm; 95\% CI 5.83-6.97; P {\textless} .01). Similar effects were seen in both large and small animals, while a minor tendency to higher risk of bias was observed in small animal studies. In conclusion, treatment with any biological therapy significantly improved AF in preclinical animal models compared with controls. Although biological therapies target markedly different fundamental mechanisms, we observed a consistent difference in their effect on AF outcomes.},

	abstract = {Separation of calves from cows within hours or days of birth is common on dairy farms. Stakeholders have conflicting perspectives on whether this practice is harmful or beneficial for the animals' welfare and production. Our objective was to critically evaluate the scientific evidence for both acute and long-term effects of early separation versus an extended period of cow-calf contact. The outcomes investigated were the behavior, welfare (excluding physical health), and performance (milk yield and growth, respectively) of dairy cows and calves. Primary research papers were found through targeted Web of Science searches, the reference lists of recent reviews for each topic, and the reference lists of papers identified from these sources. Studies were included if they were published in English, the full text was accessible, and they compared treatments with and without contact between dairy cows and calves for a specified period. Early separation (within 24 h postpartum) was found to reduce acute distress responses of cows and calves. However, longer cow-calf contact typically had positive longer-term effects on calves, promoting more normal social behavior, reducing abnormal behavior, and sometimes reducing responses to stressors. In terms of productivity, allowing cows to nurse calves generally decreased the volume of milk available for sale during the nursing period, but we found no consistent evidence of reduced milk production over a longer period. Allowing a prolonged period of nursing increased calf weight gains during the milk-feeding period. In summary, extended cow-calf contact aggravates the acute distress responses and reduces the amount of saleable milk while the calves are suckling, but it can have positive effects on behaviors relevant to welfare in the longer term and benefit calf growth. The strength of these conclusions is limited, however, given that relatively few studies address most of these effects and that experimental design including timing of contact and observations are often inconsistent across studies. Few studies presented indicators of long-term welfare effects other than abnormal and social behavior of the calves.},

DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched for all relevant articles published in English from 1980 to January 2016. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included for analysis all participants had moderate to severe ABI, n ≥ 3, and a pharmacological intervention was provided for the treatment of agitation and its effectiveness was assessed. DATA EXTRACTION: Data extracted included participant demographics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, study design, outcome measure(s), and results. Study quality was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database assessment scale for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A level of evidence was assigned to each intervention using a modified Sackett scale. DATA SYNTHESIS: Among 165 retrieved studies, 19 met inclusion criteria. The included studies consisted of 6 RCTs and 13 observational studies. Antipsychotic medications were studied predominately (n = 6), followed by anticonvulsants (n = 4) and dopaminergic (n = 4), antidepressants (n = 3), and beta-blockers (n = 2). Dopaminergic medications, specifically amantadine, had the highest level of evidence (Level 1a). The antipsychotic lithium carbonate was shown to be effective but was not recommended for use due to high risk of neurotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Studies consistently demonstrated that pharmacological treatment was effective in reducing agitation post ABI; however, there was insufficient information to develop a conclusion due to the limited number of studies and overall weakness of evidence for each individual medication.},

Yet, lack of commonly agreed methodology and heterogeneity of cut-off values published in the literature remain a challenge to the accurate determination and application of humane endpoints. With the aim to synthesize and appraise existing humane endpoint definitions for commonly used physiological parameters, we conducted a systematic review of mouse studies of acute and chronic disease models, which used body weight, temperature and/or sickness scores for endpoint definition. In the second part of the study, we used previously published and unpublished data on weight, temperature and sickness scores from mouse models of sepsis and stroke and applied machine learning algorithms to assess the usefulness of this method for parameter selection and endpoint definition across models. Studies were searched for in two electronic databases (MEDLINE/Pubmed and Embase). Out of 110 retrieved full-text manuscripts, 34 studies were included. We found large intra- and inter-model variance in humane endpoint determination and application due to varying animal models, lack of standardized experimental protocols and heterogeneity of performance metrics (part 1). Machine learning models trained with physiological data and sickness severity score or modified DeSimoni neuroscore identified animals with a high risk of death at an early time point in both mouse models of stroke (male: 93.2\% at 72h post-treatment; female: 93.0\% at 48h post-treatment) and sepsis (96.2\% at 24h post-treatment), thus demonstrating generalizability in endpoint determination across models (part 2).},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Globally, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most diagnosed cancer and the third important cause of cancer-related death. As there are only two targeted drugs for the treatment of advanced HCC-that merely extend survival by a few months-the need for alternative treatments is inevitable. Lycopene, a carotenoid that is known to be most abundant in red tomatoes and tomato-based products, has been investigated for its anticancer activity in various types of cancers including HCC. This review was conducted to evaluate the effects of lycopene on HCC from animal models to pave the way for further clinical studies. METHODS: Electronic databases and search engines including PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar were searched for original records addressing the anticancer effect of lycopene in animal models of HCC. Data were extracted using a format prepared in Microsoft Excel and exported to Stata 15.0 for analyses. A meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model at a 95\% confidence level for the outcome measures: tumor incidence, number, and growth (tumor volume and size). The presence of publication bias between studies was evaluated using Egger's test and funnel plot. The study protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database with reference number: CRD42019159312. RESULTS: The initial database search yields 286 articles, of which 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. The characteristics of the included studies were a bit diversified. The studies involved a total of 644 animals (312 treatment and 332 control groups) and mice shared the majority (488) followed by rats (117) and ferrets (39). The meta-analysis showed that lycopene significantly reduced the incidence [RR 0.8; 95\% CI 0.69, 0.92 (p=0.00); I(2) = 30.4\%, p=0.16; n=11], number [SMD-1.83; 95\% CI -3.10, -0.57 (p=0.01); I(2) = 95.9\%, p=0.00; n=9], and growth [SMD -2.13; 95\% CI -4.20, -0.04 (p=0.04); I(2) = 94.6\%, p=0.00; n=4] of HCC. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of lycopene appears to inhibit the initiation and progression of cancer in animal models of HCC. However, more controlled and thorough preclinical studies are needed to further evaluate its anti-HCC effects and associated molecular mechanisms.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Toxocariasis is a helminthozoonosis caused by the infection of a human host by the larva of Toxocara spp., predominately involving Toxocara canis and Toxocara cati, which are common nematodes in dogs and cats, respectively. Human transmission occurs through contact with animals or by consumption of food contaminated with parasite's eggs. The purpose of this article is to review the current knowledge regarding human neurotoxocariasis. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the existing literature concerning toxocariasis of the nervous system. RESULTS: Clinical spectrum of human toxocariasis varies widely from a subclinical course to significant organ morbidity. Clinical course depends on parasitic load, the migration route of the larvae and host response. Human neurotoxocariasis is a relatively rare entity yet associated with severe sequelae. Manifestations include meningitis (usually eosinophilic), encephalitis, myelitis, cerebellar vasculitis, space-occupying lesion, behavioral abnormalities, and optic neuritis. Even though valid diagnostic criteria are lacking, neurotoxocariasis should be suspected in patients with neurologic symptoms and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis with eosinophilia, positive serology for anti-Toxocara antibodies, in serum and/or CSF, sterile CSF and clinical improvement after antihelminthic treatment. Neurotoxocariasis is treated by benzimidazole components, most frequently albendazole, corticosteroids, or diethylcarbamazine. CONCLUSION: Parasite larvae migrate through tissues and are able to reach the nervous system causing neurotoxocariasis. Its clinical spectrum varies and includes myelitis, meningoencephalitis, brain abscess, and vasculitis. Neurotoxocariasis should always be suspected in patients with neurologic symptoms accompanied by eosinophilia in blood and/or CSF. Early diagnosis and treatment could prevent long-term neurologic impairment.},

The aim of this study was to provide an overview of existing data concerning the spread of this parasitosis in the countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) on the basis of the literature published over the last five decades. Systematic searches for publications were carried out on PubMed and Google Scholar, as well as in certain regional and local journals. From a total of 501 articles initially retrieved concerning T. solium cysticercosis in West African countries, only 120 articles were relevant for this review and therefore finally retained. For pigs, only eight out of sixteen countries of the region have reported porcine cysticercosis. Post-mortem examination of carcasses at slaughterhouses, meat inspection at butcheries or tongue inspection in herds have been the main source of data, but may not entirely reflect actual parasite distribution. For humans, only five out of sixteen countries reported epidemiological data on neurocysticercosis. Most data referred to neurocysticercosis prevalence among epileptic patients or isolated clinical cases. Furthermore, existing data are often old. Overall, T. solium cysticercosis remains largely neglected in West Africa, and its prevalence appears not to be affected by any religion in particular. There is an urgent need to promote and implement health partnerships and programs on this disease in order to collect more data and identify sensitive populations in the countries of the ECOWAS area.},

	abstract = {Previous meta-analyses have associated dairy products with a lower risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Since then, new studies evaluating not only total dairy but also different subtypes have been published in this field. The objective of the present work was to systematically review and meta-analyze the epidemiologic studies regarding the associations between the consumption of total dairy products and subtypes (milk, yogurt, and cheese) and the incidence of MetS. Relevant studies were identified through Medline and Cochrane databases. Eligible studies were prospective cohort studies that examined the association between dairy product consumption and/or different subtypes of dairy and the risk of MetS. Random-effects or fixed-effects models were assigned to calculate the pooled RR estimates with 95\% CIs. From the 2994 identified articles, 12 and 11 studies were included for the qualitative and quantitative synthesis, respectively. After comparing the highest with the lowest categories, total dairy product consumption was inversely associated with the risk of MetS (9 study comparisons; RR: 0.73; 95\% CI: 0.64, 0.83). Low-fat dairy and total yogurt consumption were inversely associated with the risk of MetS (low-fat dairy: 2 study comparisons; RR: 0.77; 95\% CI: 0.65, 0.91; total yogurt consumption: 4 study comparisons; RR: 0.74; 95\% CI: 0.66, 0.82). The linear RR per 1 serving of yogurt/d was 0.77 (95\% CI: 0.60, 1.00). Low-fat yogurt and whole-fat yogurt were inversely associated with the risk of MetS (low-fat yogurt: 2 study comparisons; RR: 0.72; 95\% CI: 0.62, 0.84; whole-fat yogurt: 2 study comparisons; RR: 0.81; 95\% CI: 0.70, 0.94). Total milk consumption was inversely associated with the risk of MetS (6 study comparisons; RR: 0.79; 95\% CI: 0.64, 0.97). Whole-fat dairy consumption was not associated with MetS risk. Our findings suggest that the consumption of total and low-fat dairy products, milk, and yogurt is inversely associated with the risk of MetS.

	abstract = {This study aimed to estimate the effect of gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) on the productive performance assessed by the live-weight change (LWC) of lambs, and the metabolic cost associated with parasitism by means of a meta-analysis. Data used in the meta-analyses were obtained from twenty papers selected using the following criteria: (a) lambs with (I) and without (NI) GIN; (b) lambs fed ad libitum; (c) LWC data; (d) feed consumption data; and (e) chemical composition of diets. The effect of diet composition (crude protein [CP] and metabolizable energy [ME]) on dry matter intake (DMI), and the effect of composition and nutrient intake (DMI and CP intake [CPI]) and ME intake (MEI) on LWC was evaluated using respective regression analyses. The metabolic cost of worm burden was determined as the difference in CP and ME requirements between NI and I lambs for each adult parasite. The CP and ME cost were evaluated for lambs at two different levels: maintenance level 0 g LWC and 100 g LWC. The worm burden had an impact on the DMI and LWC of lambs (P {\textless} 0.05). The association of CP x infection level was the best predictor of DMI. The association between MEI and infection level were the best predictors of LWC. The metabolic cost of GIN increased to 0.30 mg CP/kg LW(0.75) and 0.0056 kJ ME/kg LW(0.75) for each adult parasite. The metabolic cost was not modified by diet quality (maintenance level 0 g LW/day or 100 g LW/day). In conclusion, GIN has a negative effect on DMI and LWC. The metabolic cost of GIN infection can be covered by supplying the additional requirements for protein and energy in the diet of infected lambs.},

	abstract = {This study estimated the impact of condensed tannin (CT) consumption on dry matter intake (DMI) and live weight change (LWC) of growing sheep by means of a meta-analysis. A metabolic cost associated to CT intake was also estimated. Data included in the meta-analysis were obtained from scientific literature with the following inclusion criteria: (a) growing lambs fed ad-libitum without gastrointestinal nematode infection, (b) feed consumption data, (c) chemical composition of diets, and (d) CT consumption data. Data were analyzed as a whole data-set or grouped into three categories: (a) sheep consuming CT (CT group), (b) sheep not consuming CT (non-CT group) and (c) sheep consuming CT+polyethylene glycol (CT+PEG group). The effect of diet composition and quality (crude protein (CP), organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), condensed tannins (CT), metabolizable energy (ME), dry matter digestibility (DMD), OM digestibility (OMD) and CP digestibility (CPD)) on DMI (g/kg$^{\textrm{0.75}}$) was evaluated using regression analyses. The effect of diet composition and consumption of those same variables (g/kg$^{\textrm{0.75}}$) on LWC (g/kg$^{\textrm{0.75}}$) were also evaluated using respective regression analyses. The metabolic cost of CT consumption was estimated in terms of digestible crude protein (DCP) and ME requirements. The cost was estimated for a diet to sustain maintenance and a diet to supply 100 g/d LWC requirements. No effect was found of CT intake on DMI or LWC (P{\textgreater}0.05). The DMI was best predicted by CP and DMD concentration (g/kg DM), when analyzed as a whole data-set. When analyzed as separate categories for CT and non-CT group was best predicted by ME (MJ/kg DM) (P{\textless}0.05). For the CT+PEG group the DMI was best predicted by NDF (P{\textless}0.05). The LWC was best predicted by DCPI$^{\textrm{2}}$ when analyzed as a whole data-set. The best predictor of LWC was the DCP intake (for the CT data) and the ME intake (for non-CT data and CT+PEG data) (P{\textless}0.05). Although CT intake do not have an effect on DMI and LWC, it was observed that at low dietary CP level increases DCP requirement and hence it does have a metabolic cost associated. The metabolic cost of CT consumption estimated for animals consuming a maintenance diet was 0.33 MJ of ME/kg$^{\textrm{0.75}}$ and 1.04 g of DCP/kg$^{\textrm{0.75}}$ and for animals fed a 100 g LWC diet was 0.13 MJ of ME/kg$^{\textrm{0.75}}$ and 0.87 g DCP/kg$^{\textrm{0.75}}$. Thus, a higher cost for CT intake was found for groups of lambs at low feeding level and the metabolic cost was reduced when lambs were at higher feeding levels.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Streptomycin is used as an epidemiological marker in monitoring programs for antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella serovars and indicates the presence of pentaresistance. However, comprehensive data on streptomycin resistant Salmonella among human, animal, and animal products is lacking in Ethiopia. In this review, we aimed to assess heterogeneity and pooled proportion of Salmonella serovars to streptomycin resistance among human, animal and animal products in Ethiopia. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature from Ethiopia. We used the MEDLINE/ PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases to identify genetic and phenotypic data on Salmonella isolates. To determine the heterogeneity and pooled proportion, we used metaprop commands and the random-effects model. Relative and cumulative frequencies were calculated to describe the overall preponderance of streptomycin resistance isolates after arcsine-transformed data. Metan funnel and meta-bias using a begg test were performed to check for publication bias. RESULTS: Overall, we included 1475 Salmonella serovars in this meta-analysis. The pooled proportion of streptomycin resistance was 47\% (95\% CI: 35-60\%). Sub-group analysis by target population showed that the proportion of streptomycin resistance in Salmonella serovars was 54\% (95\% CI: 35-73\%) in animal, 44\% (95\% Cl: 33-59\%) in humans and 39\% (95\% CI: 24-55\%) in animals products. The streptomycin resistant Salmonella serovars were statistically increasing from 0.35(95\% CI: 0.12-0.58) in 2003 to 0.77(95\% CI: 0.64-0.89) in 2018. The level of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella serovars was 50.1\% in the meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: We found a high level of streptomycin resistance, including multidrug, Salmonella serovars among human, animals, and animal products. This resistance was significantly increasing in the last three decades (1985-2018). The resistance to streptomycin among Salmonella serovars isolated from animals was higher than humans. This mandates the continuous monitoring of streptomycin use and practicing one health approach to preventing further development of resistance in Ethiopia. REGISTRATION: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis after registration of the protocol in PROSPERO (CRD42019135116) following the MOOSE (Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology).},

We performed meta-analyses and subgroup analyses. We also examined methodological quality and publication bias. We screened 2543 publications and included 145 publications (N = 21 048 animals, five species). Essential methodological details were not reported in the majority of studies. We found evidence of publication bias for birth weight. Offspring of mothers with obesity had higher body weight (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.76 [95\% CI 0.60;0.93]), fat percentage (0.99 [0.64;1.35]), systolic blood pressure (1.33 [0.75;1.91]), triglycerides (0.64 [0.42;0.86], total cholesterol (0.46 [0.18;0.73]), glucose level (0.43 [0.24;0.63]), and insulin level (0.81 [0.61;1.02]) than offspring of control mothers, but similar birth weight. Sex, age, or species did not influence the effect of maternal obesity on offspring's cardiometabolic health. Obesity before and during pregnancy reduces offspring cardiometabolic health in animals. Future intervention studies should investigate whether reducing obesity prior to conception could prevent these detrimental programming effects and improve cardiometabolic health of future generations.},

	abstract = {Maternal obesity in pregnancy is associated with neurobehavioral problems in the offspring. Establishing causality has been challenging in existing human studies, due to confounding by genetic and postnatal environment. Animal experiments can improve our understanding of this association. This systematic review examined the effects of maternal obesity in pregnancy on offspring neurobehavior in animal models. We included 26 studies (1047 offspring animals). Meta-analyses showed that offspring of obese mothers displayed higher levels of locomotor activity (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.34 [0.10; 0.58]) and anxiety behavior (SMD 0.47 [0.16; 0.79]) than offspring of lean mothers, but similar memory abilities (SMD -0.06 [-0.52; 0.39]). Meta-analysis of learning abilities was not sensible due to heterogeneity. Although the evidence was heterogeneous and the quality of the included studies generally unclear, this systematic review of animal studies indicates an effect of maternal obesity on increased offspring locomotor activity and anxiety, but not on offspring memory performance. These findings may be important from a public health perspective since obesity is rapidly increasing worldwide, and warrant further research.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the initial defibrillation energy dose that is associated with sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) during paediatric cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. METHODS: A systematic review was performed using four databases (PROSPERO: CRD42016036734). Human studies and animal model studies of pediatric cardiac arrest involving assessment of external defibrillation energy dosing were considered. The primary outcome was sustained ROSC. Survival and defibrillation-induced complications were also evaluated. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 14,471 citations of which 232 manuscripts were reviewed. Ten human and 10 animal model studies met the inclusion criteria. Human studies were prospective (n = 6) or retrospective (n = 4) cohort studies and included between 11 and 266 patients (median = 46 patients). Sustained ROSC rates ranged from 0 to 61\% (n = 7). No studies reported a statistically significant association between the initial defibrillation energy dose and the rate of sustained ROSC (n = 7) or survival (n = 6). Meta-analysis was not considered appropriate due to clinical heterogeneity. Risk of bias was moderate. All animal studies were randomized controlled trials with 8 and 52 (median = 27) piglets. ROSC was frequently achieved (≥85\%) with energy dose ranging from 2 to 7 J/kg (n = 7). The defibrillation threshold varied according to the body weight and appears to be higher in infant. CONCLUSION: Defibrillation energy doses and thresholds varied according to the body weight and trended higher for infants. No definitive association between initial defibrillation doses and the sustained ROSC or survival could be demonstrated. Clinicians should follow local consensus-based guidelines.},

	abstract = {Anisakidae are marine zoonotic nematodes with most commercial fish species as intermediate hosts. Both public health risks and socio-economic problems are attributed to these larvae. Despite these concerns, the occurrence of Anisakidae in commercial fish species in Belgium remains unknown. Therefore, the main objective of this systematic review was to look into studies assessing the prevalence and intensity (level of infection) of Anisakidae in countries importing fish to the Belgian market. The databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Cordis, Google Scholar, Google, African Journals online and Asia Journals online were searched. Main eligibility criteria were: fish species consumed in Belgium; studies conducted in one of the main importing countries; and the availability of prevalence data. From the original 519 identified studies, 83 were included with data from Spain, Germany, Chile, Denmark, Turkey, France, China, England, Belgium, Norway, Iceland, Senegal and Sweden. Overall results show a widespread occurrence of Anisakidae with a high variability in prevalence between fish species and fishing sea. Cod (Gadus morhua) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), the most consumed fish species in Belgium, have a mean prevalence of 33\% and 5\% respectively. Of all investigated fishing zones, fish caught in the Northeast Atlantic has the highest rate of infection (68\%). Furthermore, higher prevalences were found when looking at the viscera (mean prevalence 59\%) compared to the muscle (29\%) and with superior techniques such as enzymatic digestion or UV press (46\%) compared to candling, the routine method (23\%). Farmed fish were found to be the least infected (2\%) but were still not Anisakidae free. The widespread presence of Anisakidae and the associated food safety implications indicate the need to further investigate the presence of Anisakidae in fish in the Belgian market.},

The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to analyse seroprevalence studies of WNV in equids in European countries between 2001 and 2018. Two electronic databases, PubMed and Scopus, were searched for relevant publications published from 2001 to 2018 using predetermined keywords. A total of 1,484 papers were initially found. After applying the eligibility criteria, 39 papers were finally included in the systematic review. Analysis of 28,089 equids from 16 European countries revealed a pooled seroprevalence of 8\% (95\% CI 5\%-12\%, p {\textless} .001, I(2)  = 99.3\%) in Europe. The pooled seroprevalence was slightly higher in Mediterranean basin countries than other countries and when calculated for samples collected between 2001 and 2009 compared to 2010 to 2018. Differences in study design (e.g. sampling associated with recent outbreaks of WNV) contributed to a high degree of variability among studies. Further studies with harmonized study design and reporting of the results are recommended to better estimate and monitor European seroprevalence of WNV in equids.},

	abstract = {Dietary resistant starch (RS) may have prebiotic properties but its effects on fermentation and the microbial population are inconsistent. This meta-analysis aimed to quantify the relationship between RS type 2 (RS2) and intestinal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and pH as well as certain key bacterial taxa for intestinal health in pigs. From the 24 included articles with sufficient information about the animal, and dietary and physiological measurements published between 2000 and 2017, individual sub-data sets for fermentation metabolites, pH, bacterial abundances and apparent total tract digestibility were built and used to parameterize prediction models on the effect of RS2, accounting for inter- and intra-study variability. In addition, the effect of pig's BW at the start of the experiment and duration of the experimental period on response variables were also evaluated using backward elimination analysis. Dietary RS levels ranged from 0\% to 78.0\% RS, with median and mean RS levels of 28.8\% and 23.0\%, respectively. Negative relationships could be established between dietary RS and pH in the large intestine (P\&lt;0.05), with a stronger effect in the mid and distal colon, and feces (R 2=0.64 to 0.81; P\&lt;0.001). A dietary level of 15\% RS would lower the pH in the proximal, mid-, distal colon and feces by 0.2, 0.6, 0.4 and 0.6 units, respectively. Increasing RS levels, however, did not affect SCFA concentrations in the hindgut, but enhanced the molar proportion of propionate in mid-colon and reduced those of acetate in mid-colon and of butyrate in mid- and distal colon (R 2=0.46 to 0.52; P\&lt;0.05). Backward elimination indicated an age-related decrease in mid-colonic propionate proportion and increase in mid- and distal colonic butyrate proportion (P\&lt;0.05), thereby modulating RS2 effects. In feces, increasing RS levels promoted fecal lactobacilli (R 2=0.46; P\&lt;0.01) and bifidobacteria (R 2=0.57; P\&lt;0.01), whereby the slope showed the need for a minimal RS level of 10\% for a 0.5 log unit-increase in their abundance. Best-fit equations further supported that a longer experimental period increased fecal lactobacilli but decreased fecal bifidobacteria (P\&lt;0.05). In conclusion, dietary RS2 seems to effectively decrease digesta pH throughout the large intestine and increase lactic acid-producing bacteria in feces of pigs which may limit the growth of opportunistic pathogens in the hindgut. To achieve these physiologically relevant changes, dietary RS should surpass 10\% to 15\%.},

Meta-analysis was conducted in STATA program and heterogeneity and prevalence values were pooled by host species with 95\% confidence interval. In intermediate hosts, the overall prevalence of Echinococcus by meat inspection was 10\% (CI: 9-11\%) in small ruminants, 7\% (CI: 5-8\%) in cattle, 1\% (CI: 0-1\%) in pigs and 9\% (CI: 0-29\%) in wild herbivores.

Echinococcus equinus, E. canadensis, E ortleppi and E. felidis were reported from wildlife and E. ortleppi, E. granulosus s. s. and E. canadensis from humans. There is paucity of research in echinococcosis and gaps in prevalence reports over time in both humans and animals in the SADC region and we recommend an increase in future studies on the epidemiology of disease, risk factors for transmission in animals and humans and its relation with human health specially in the advent of HIV pandemic following a "One Health" approach.},

This work provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of the last 40 years (1981-2020) of scientific publications on SRLV individual and flock prevalence. Fifty-eight publications and 314 studies were included. Most articles used a single diagnostic test to estimate prevalence (77.6\%), whereas articles using three or more tests were scarce (6.9\%). Serological tests are more frequently used than direct methods and ELISA has progressively replaced AGID over the last decades. SRLV infection in sheep is widespread across the world, with Europe showing the highest individual prevalence (40.9\%) and being the geographical area in which most studies have been performed. Africa, Asia, and North America show values between 16.7\% to 21.8\% at the individual level. South and Central America show the lowest individual SRLV prevalence (1.7\%). There was a strong positive correlation between individual and flock prevalence (p = 0.728; p 0.001). Despite the global importance of small ruminants, the coverage of knowledge on SRLV prevalence is patchy and inconsistent.

	abstract = {Rodents represent 42\% of the world's mammalian biodiversity encompassing 2,277 species populating every continent (except Antarctica) and are reservoir hosts for a wide diversity of disease agents. Thus, knowing the identity, diversity, host-pathogen relationships, and geographic distribution of rodent-borne zoonotic pathogens, is essential for predicting and mitigating zoonotic disease outbreaks. Hantaviruses are hosted by numerous rodent reservoirs. However, the diversity of rodents harboring hantaviruses is likely unknown because research is biased toward specific reservoir hosts and viruses. An up-to-date, systematic review covering all known rodent hosts is lacking. Herein, we document gaps in our knowledge of the diversity and distribution of rodent species that host hantaviruses. Of the currently recognized 681 cricetid, 730 murid, 61 nesomyid, and 278 sciurid species, we determined that 11.3, 2.1, 1.6, and 1.1\%, respectively, have known associations with hantaviruses. The diversity of hantaviruses hosted by rodents and their distribution among host species supports a reassessment of the paradigm that each virus is associated with a single-host species. We examine these host-virus associations on a global taxonomic and geographical scale with emphasis on the rodent host diversity and distribution. Previous reviews have been centered on the viruses and not the mammalian hosts. Thus, we provide a perspective not previously addressed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Review of the literature to identify practical, high-fidelity, commercially available animal models for simulation training and surgical skills maintenance in laryngotracheal reconstruction (LTR). METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed and Embase databases was conducted independently by two authors, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Search terms included "laryngotracheal reconstruction," "laryngotracheoplasty," "pig and larynx," "sheep and larynx," and "rabbit and larynx." Articles were then assessed, identifying model cost and availability, model validation, feasibility as a training tool, and verisimilitude to pediatric LTR. RESULTS: In total, 79 articles were considered suitable for inclusion in the study, incorporating both in vitro and in vivo models. Models utilized included rabbit (n = 69), pig (n = 7), sheep (n = 1), and goat (n = 2). The rabbit model was similar in size to the neonate, but differences in laryngeal anatomy and cartilage texture made graft insertion difficult. The anatomy of the pig, sheep, and goat larynges more closely resembled the pediatric patient, allowing improved grafting, but corresponded more in size to that of an older child. Commercial availability of the pig and sheep was considered greatest, and was reflected in cost. None of the animal models identified in the literature have been validated as a simulation tool. CONCLUSIONS: The rabbit, sheep and pig models seemed to demonstrate the greatest potential for use as advanced pediatric airway surgery simulation models, with the rabbit model being most utilized in the literature. However, as yet there have been no models formally validated as a simulation training tool. Laryngoscope, 129:235-243, 2019.},

This systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to answer the clinical question: "Does obtaining microscopically tumour-free surgical margins reduce risk for local tumour recurrence in canine cutaneous and subcutaneous STS?" A total of 486 citations were screened, 66 of which underwent full-text evaluation, with 10 studies representing 278 STS excisions ultimately included. Cumulatively, 16/164 (9.8\%) of completely excised and 38/114 (33.3\%) of incompletely excised STS recurred. Overall relative risk of 0.396 (95\% confidence interval = 0.248-0.632) was calculated for local recurrence in STS excised with complete margins as compared to STS excised with incomplete margins. Risk of bias was judged to be low for all studies in terms of selection bias and detection bias but high for all studies in terms of performance bias and exclusion bias. The results of the present meta-analysis, coupled with the results of individual previous studies, strongly suggest that microscopically complete surgical margins confer a significantly reduced risk for local tumour recurrence in canine STS. Future studies ideally should adhere to standardized conducting and reporting guidelines to reduce systematic bias.},

Bone tissue repair is coordinated by an inflammatory dynamic process mediated by osteoprogenitor cells of the periosteum and endosteum, responsible for the formation of a new bone matrix. Studies using antioxidant products from plants for bone lesion treatment have been growing worldwide. We developed a systematic review to compile the results of works with animal models investigating the anti-inflammatory activity of plant extracts in the treatment of bone lesions and analyze the methodological quality of the studies on this subject. Studies were selected in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases according to the PRISMA statement. The research filters were constructed using three parameters: animal model, bone repair, and plant extracts. 31 full-text articles were recovered from 10 countries. Phytochemical prospecting was reported in 15 studies (48.39\%). The most common secondary metabolites were flavonoids, cited in 32.26\% studies (n = 10). Essential criteria to in vivo animal studies were frequently underreported, suggesting publication bias. The animals treated with plant extracts presented positive results in the osteoblastic proliferation, and consequently, this treatment accelerated osteogenic differentiation and bone callus formation, as well as bone fracture repair. Possibly, these results are associated with antioxidant, regenerative, and anti-inflammatory power of the extracts. The absence or incomplete characterization of the animal models, treatment protocols, and phytochemical and toxicity analyses impairs the internal validity of the evidence, making it difficult to determine the effectiveness and safety of plant-derived products in bone repair.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prosthetic materials for the repair of abdominal wall defects have been studied extensively to improve outcome. A new approach can be the use of a slowly resorbable synthetic mesh, which aims to combine advantages of both synthetic and biological meshes. The objective of this review is to give an overview of the physicochemical characteristics and biomechanical, histological, and macroscopic outcome (recurrence, adhesion formation) of the use of resorbable synthetic meshes, for treatment and prevention of abdominal wall hernias, based on experimental studies. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Only experimental studies were included. Outcome parameters were resorption, degradation, organization of connective tissue, inflammatory response, tensile strength, and amount of adhesion formation. Surgical characteristics were taken into account as well (type of defect, clean versus contaminated model, position mesh, repair of the defect, recurrences). RESULTS: In total, eleven articles were included. Three absorbable synthetic meshes are currently available: GORE BIO-A mesh (Gore), TIGR Matrix Surgical mesh (Novus Scientific), and Phasix mesh (Bard). Two studies concluded that, despite an early transient inflammatory reaction in the first months, remodeling was good in GORE BIO-A, 6-12 mo after augmentation or suture line reinforcement with only minimal to moderate adhesions when used intraperitoneally. The TIGR Matrix Surgical mesh shows only partial remodeling with a persistent foreign body reaction after 1 y. Phasix mesh seems to perform well in extraperitoneal implantation after 1 y in two studies, although the defect was small. Only two studies directly compared two resorbable synthetic meshes under the same circumstances. The latter also included a number of animals where the meshes were used in a contaminated nonhernia model. No hernia recurrences or deaths of animals were described in all studies. CONCLUSIONS: The use of resorbable synthetic meshes in the prevention or treatment of abdominal wall defects in animal experiments with small defects in clean setting seems safe, with no serious complications related to the device during short-term follow-up. However, there is no evidence available that can support the advantages of resorbable synthetic meshes over the use of synthetic or biological meshes, mostly due to lack of good data. More experimental studies are needed, followed by randomized controlled trials and prospective registries in humans with a sufficiently long follow-up period, to reveal the potential advantages in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Ca digestibility and utilisation in growing pigs are not well understood, and are usually neglected in diet formulation. This has implications not only for the accurate determination of its requirements but also for its interactions with other nutrients. A systematic review and meta-analysis (meta-regression) of published trials was carried out to quantify factors affecting Ca absorption and utilisation, and to derive an estimate of Ca endogenous excretion. The analysis was carried out on the data from forty studies, corresponding to 201 treatments performed on 1204 pigs. The results indicated that although Ca absorption and retention (g/kg of body weight per d) increased with increasing Ca intake (P{\textless}0·001), non-phytate-P intake (P{\textless}0·001) and exogenous phytase supplementation (P{\textless}0·001), these values decreased with increasing phytate-P intake (P{\textless}0·05). Interactions between exogenous phytase and Ca intake, indicating reduced efficacy of this enzyme (P{\textless}0·001), and between phytate-P intake and exogenous phytase, counteracting the direct negative effect of phytate-P (P{\textless}0·05) on Ca absorption and retention, were also detected. There were no effects of animal-related characteristics, such as pig genotype in Ca absorption and retention. The large amount of variance explained in Ca absorption (90 \%) and retention (91 \%) supported our choice of independent variables. Endogenous Ca losses obtained via linear regression were 239 mg/kg of DM intake (95 \% CI 114, 364). These outcomes advance the current understanding of Ca digestibility and utilisation, and should contribute towards establishing requirements for digestible Ca. Consequently, pig diets will be more correctly formulated if digestible Ca values are used in estimating requirements for Ca.},

Several studies have investigated the association between pet ownership and obesity, but the findings have been inconsistent. This systematic literature review and meta-analysis assessed the association between pet ownership and obesity. Using PubMed and Scopus, we overviewed the literature published until December 2019 and selected pertinent data for meta-analysis. Two independent reviewers extracted the data. Pooled relative risks (RRs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for obesity were calculated using the random-effects model with inverse-variance weighting. The 21 included articles were cross-sectional studies. Five publications (nine analyses) that reported adjusted RRs for BMI ≥ 25 were included in the meta-analysis. No significant association existed between pet ownership and obesity (pooled RR = 1.038; 95\% CI, 0.922-1.167; I(2) = 51.8\%). After stratification by age group (children vs. adults), no significant association was detected (pooled RR = 0.844; 95\% CI, 0.604-1.179; I(2) = 64.1\% vs. pooled RR = 1.099; 95\% CI, 0.997-1.212; I(2) = 25.2\%). Similarly, no significant association was observed between dog ownership and obesity, indicating no association between pet ownership and obesity. However, no infer causation can be reported because all studies included in this meta-analysis were cross-sectional. Therefore, further prospective studies are needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this review was to establish the current epidemiology of taeniosis, cysticercosis and trichinellosis among humans and animals in Iran by carrying out a comprehensive assessment of published articles reporting on these foodborne zoonotic diseases across the country. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was used in the search for relevant published articles reporting on cysticercosis, taeniosis and trichinellosis in Iran using a number of appropriate key words. The search was conducted through PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, SpringerLink, SCOPUS, WHOLIS, FAO and CDC. Published scientific articles including journals, books and book chapters reporting on cysticercosis, taeniosis and trichinellosis in Iran for the period between 1967 and 2018 were selected. RESULTS: A total of 37 articles met the search criteria and were incorporated in this review. Of these, 10 (27\%) reported on human taeniosis, 15 (40.5\%) on cysticercosis (10 on Taenia saginata and five on Taenia spp. cysticercosis) and 12 (32.5\%) on trichinellosis. T. saginata was implicated in all human taeniosis cases. All Taenia spp. cysticercosis cases were reported among domesticated pigs and wild animals. A case of neurocysticercosis was reported in a male patient at Shohada Hospital in Tehran. Eleven (91.7\%) of the 12 studies reported on trichinellosis among wild animals, while one (8.3\%) study detected anti-Trichinella IgG in 8 (2.2\%) of the 364 at-risk human beings tested. Nevertheless, most of these studies were carried out in northern Iran. CONCLUSION: This review found T. saginata to be the most prevalent and of greater economic and public health significance in Iran. However, T. solium and Trichinella spp. were of little significance to human health. More studies should focus on other regions besides northern Iran.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a major cause of acute hepatitis in humans worldwide and have high burden in the resource-limited countries. Better knowledge of the epidemiology of hepatitis in animals in Africa can help to understand the epidemiology among humans. The objective of this study was to summarize the prevalence of HEV infection and distribution of HEV genotypes among animals in Africa. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we comprehensively searched PubMed, EMBASE, African Journals Online, and Africa Index Medicus from January 1st, 2000 to March 22th, 2020 without any language restriction. We considered cross-sectional studies of HEV infection in animals in Africa. Study selection, data extraction, and methodological quality of included studies were done independently by two investigators. Prevalence data were pooled using the random-effects meta-analysis. This review was registered in PROSPERO, CRD42018087684. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies (13 species and 6983 animals) were included. The prevalence (antibodies or ribonucleic acid [RNA]) of HEV infection in animals varied widely depending on biological markers of HEV infection measured: 23.4\% (95\% confidence interval; 12.0-37.2) for anti-HEV immunoglobulins G, 13.1\% (3.1-28.3) for anti-HEV immunoglobulins M, and 1.8\% (0.2-4.3) for RNA; with substantial heterogeneity. In subgroup analysis, the immunoglobulins G seroprevalence was higher among pigs 37.8\% (13.9-65.4). The following HEV genotypes were reported in animals: Rat-HEV genotype 1 (rats and horses), HEV-3 (pigs), HEV-7 (dromedaries), and Bat hepeviruses (bats). CONCLUSIONS: We found a high prevalence of HEV infection in animals in Africa and HEV genotypes close to that of humans. Some animals in Africa could be the reservoir of HEV, highlighting the need of molecular epidemiological studies for investigating zoonotic transmission.},

ALA plays an important role in scavenging intracellular radicals and inflammatory elements. AL-1 is found in herbal medicines with potent anti-inflammatory properties. Data were collected from the Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Evidence-based medicine/clinical trials, and Cochrane library database until 2017, which finally resulted in 22 animal studies (70 rats and 162 mice). The beneficial effects of ALA or AL-1 on the most important parameters of UC were reviewed; also, studies were considered separately in mice and rats. Administration of ALA and AL-1 significantly reduced the tumor necrosis factor-α level compared with the controls, while data were not noteworthy in the meta-analysis (mean differences = -18.57 [95\% CI = -42.65 to 5.51], P = 0.13). In spite of insignificant decrease in meta-analysis outcomes (differences = 6.92 [95\% CI = -39.33 to 53.16], P = 0.77), a significant reduction in myeloperoxidase activity was shown following ALA or AL-1 treatment compared with the controls. Despite significant differences in each study, we had to exclude some studies to homogenize data for meta-analyzing as they showed insignificant results. Interleukin 6, cyclooxygenase-2, glutathione, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, histopathological score, macroscopic and microscopic scores, disease activity index, body weight change, and colon length were also reviewed. Most studies have emphasized on significant positive effects of ALA and AL-1. Comprehensive clinical trials are obligatory to determine the precious position of ALA or AL-1 in the management of UC.},

Five studies focused on ruminants, including cattle, buffaloes, sheep and goats in the states of Terengganu and Perak. The most frequent ruminant fascioliasis outbreaks involved cattle and goats, with a prevalence of 82\%-95\% and these outbreaks occurred in Terengganu. Only one study examined the risk of fascioliasis in cattle. In the study, the age and sex of the cattle were important risk-related parameters. The search returned only one documented report of a suspected case of human fascioliasis with an atypical clinical presentation. At present, human fascioliasis in Malaysia remains under-reported and its prevalence remains unknown.

METHODS: Pertinent prospective cohort studies attained using electronic searches through PubMed, and Scopus up to September 25th, 2017. Relative risks (RR) s with corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) of the highest versus the lowest for cohort studies were evaluated using DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models to find combined RRs. We also assessed the dose-response effect of this relationship. RESULTS: A total of 7 studies involving 354 718 participants were met inclusion criteria. The pooled RR of total stroke risk was [RR = 0.92 95\% CI, 0.82, 1.03, I(2) = 19.8\%, P(heterogeneity) = 0.28] for the highest versus lowest categories of poultry intake. Subgroup analysis showed an inverse associations for the US people [RR = 0.86 95\% CI, 0.77, 0.95, I(2) = 0.0\%, P(heterogeneity) = 0.38] and women [RR = 0.83, 95\% CI, 0.72, 0.93, I(2) = 0.0\%, P(heterogeneity) = 0.63]. We did not obtain any significant association in the subtypes of strokes with highest versus lowest poultry intake [Ischemic stroke (RR = 0.91; 95\% CI: 0.79, 1.02, I(2) = 0.0\%, p = 0.93), Hemorrhagic (RR = 0.82; 95\% CI: 0.59, 1.04, I(2) = 20.5\%, P(heterogeneity) = 0.28)]. One serving per week increment in poultry intake was not associated with the risk of stroke (RR: 1.00, 95\% CI: 0.96, 1.03, I(2) = 69.0\%, P(heterogeneity) = 0.004). Nonlinear dose-response meta-analysis showed lower risk of stroke at consumption ∼1 serving/week. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis revealed that poultry intake is not associated with total stroke risk; furthermore, an inverse relationship in US population and females must be interpreted with caution.},

Fifteen studies, including eight studies with a case-control design (735 patients and 1342 controls) and seven studies with a cross-sectional design (a total of 4804 participants, 1302 individuals with ASDs and 3502 without ASDs), were included in the meta-analysis. We found an increased risk for ASDs in individuals with Toxocara seropositivity (OR 1.75 [95\% CI 1.16 to 2.64]). Subanalysis showed that Toxocara seropositivity was significantly associated with urticaria (OR 2.97 [95\% CI 1.53 to 5.76]), however, it was not significantly associated with atopy (OR 1.08 [95\% CI 0.55 to 2.15]) and eczema (OR 1.62 [95\% CI 0.95 to 2.78]). Moreover, the pooled ORs were 2.34 (95\% CI 1.32 to 4.15) and 1.27 (95\% CI 0.69 to 2.35) for case-control and cross-sectional studies, respectively. The results of our study support hypotheses regarding the existence of a positive relationship between Toxocara infection and allergic disorders, although this association should be further investigated by longitudinal and mechanism studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the fact that pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have significantly reduced the rate of invasive pneumococcal diseases through the use of vaccine serotypes, infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a major public health hazard. Serotype-independent vaccines that are economically viable species of common protein antigens such as whole-cell vaccines (WCVs) are needed. Considering the ongoing debate about the effectiveness of WCVs, a systematic literature review and meta-analysis was carried out to determine the efficacy of WCVs against colonization in mice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review was undertaken of published studies on the protection (colonized/uncolonized) of whole cell pneumococcal vaccine in mice. The search terms used were "whole cell vaccine" and "Streptococcus pneumoniae" in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus engines. Data was extracted from original publications and a meta-analysis was performed on studies divided into sub-groups by the number of inoculations, type of sample, type of adjuvant, time of sampling, design of study and quality of study. RESULTS: Ten eligible articles published from 2000 to 2016 were included in this review. The meta-analysis was performed on eight out of 10 studies and demonstrated that the estimated pooled risk ratios (RRs) for comparison of colonization between the vaccinated and unvaccinated mice for outcomes 1 and 2 were 0.18 and 0.24, respectively. Lower RRs were observed in sub-groups that were inoculated with vaccines three times, those using cholera toxin (CT) adjuvants and those obtained as tracheal specimens from the mice. CONCLUSIONS: The best protocol for use of a WCV is its application with CT adjuvant administered intranasally in three inoculations at doses of 10⁸ CFU. Further studies performed under similar conditions to obtain accurate results on the effectiveness of this vaccine are recommended.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasmosis is a disease caused by the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii). Human toxoplasmosis seroprevalence in Malaysia has increased since it was first reported in 1973 as shown in previous reviews of 1991 and 2007. However, over a decade since the last review, comprehensive data on toxoplasmosis in Malaysia is lacking. This work aimed at reviewing articles on toxoplasmosis research in Malaysia in order to identify the research gaps, create public awareness, and efforts made so far and proffer management options on the disease. The present review examines the available published research articles from 2008 to 2018 related to toxoplasmosis research conducted in Malaysia. The articles reviewed were retrieved from nine credible databases such as Web of Science, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Scopus, Springer, Wiley online library, Ovid, and Cochrane using the keywords; Malaysia, toxoplasmosis, Toxoplasma gondii, toxoplasma encephalitis, seroprevalence, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients, pregnant women, genotype strain, anti-toxoplasma antibodies, felines, and vaccine. The data highlighted seropositive cases from healthy community members in Pangkor Island (59.7\%) and among migrant workers (57.4\%) at alarming rates, as well as 42.5\% in pregnant women. Data on animal seroprevalence were limited and there was no information on cats as the definitive host. Genetic characterization of Toxoplasma gondii from HIV patients; pregnant women, and domestic cats is lacking. This present review on toxoplasmosis is beneficial to researchers, health workers, animal health professionals, and policymakers. Therefore, attention is required to educate and enlighten health workers and the general public about the risk factors associated with T. gondii infection in Malaysia.},

The ease of access to maggot therapy has made it increasingly attractive for implementation. This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of maggot therapy as compared to hydrogel dressings in the healing of chronic wounds. METHODS: An electronic literature search until October 2019 was performed using Medline, Embase, and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature. The eligibility criteria were chronic wound patients with an intervention that involved a comparison of any maggot species with hydrogel dressings. RESULTS: The full text of five studies, involving 580 patients with chronic wounds, was retrieved. Four studies used the Lucilia sericata species. The maggot therapy facilitated faster and more effective debridement of non-viable tissue. It enabled faster development of granulation tissue and increased reduction in the wound surface area compared to hydrogel dressings. Maggot therapy had no effect on disinfection or complete healing rate for the wound. CONCLUSION: Maggot therapy should be considered for faster wound debridement, granulation tissue development, and wound surface area reduction as well as in surgical contraindications. This review can be used as a guide to assist clinicians in identifying patients who may benefit from maggot therapy.},

	abstract = {Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important parasitic disease which is endemic in different parts of Iran; and domestic and wild canines are principal reservoir hosts of the disease. The objective of this study was to review the spatial distribution of canine VL (CVL) caused by Leishmania infantum in domestic and wild canines in different geographical areas of Iran. An extensive literature search was conducted in different international and national databases, including Cochrane, MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Iran Medex to find articles with the words "visceral leishmaniasis in Iran" in their titles and "canine visceral leishmaniasis in Iran" or "feline visceral leishmaniasis in Iran" or "accidental reservoir hosts of visceral leishmaniasis in Iran" in their subtitles, irrespective of the type and duration of study. Screening of the irrelevant articles from total 36,342, yielded 61 eligible articles. More than 93\% of the studies were carried out on domestic dogs (Canis familiaris, n = 57) and the remaining were on other carnivores such as wild canines including foxes (Vulpes vulpes, n = 4), jackals (C. aureus, n = 6) and wolves (C. lupus, n = 6); while studies on domestic cats (Felis catus, n = 3) as well as desert rodents (n = 2) were rare. The average rate of L. infantum infections reported among domestic dogs using direct agglutination test (DAT) in Iran was 12.5\%. The highest prevalence rate (14\%) was reported from the northwest regions of the country where VL is endemic. The review indicates that CVL is endemic in various parts of Iran and domestic dogs are the main and potential reservoir hosts of the disease. Other carnivores, such as domestic cats and some species of desert rodents (Cricetulus migratorius, Mesocricetus auratus and Meriones persicus) seem to be playing a role in the maintenance of transmission cycle of L. infantum in the endemic areas of the disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment of acute trauma coagulopathy has shifted toward rapid replacement of coagulation factors with frozen plasma (FP). There are logistic difficulties in providing FP. Freeze-dried plasma (FDP) may have logistical advantages including easier storage and rapid preparation time. This review assesses the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of FDP in trauma. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Studies were searched from Medline, Embase, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar. Observational and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing FDP use in trauma were included. Trauma animal models addressing FDP use were also included. Bias was assessed using validated tools. Primary outcome was efficacy, and secondary outcomes were feasibility and safety. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effect models. Evidence was graded using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation profile. RESULTS: Twelve human studies (RCT, 1; observational, 11) and 15 animal studies were included. Overall, studies demonstrated moderate risk of bias. Data from two studies (n = 119) were combined for meta-analyses for mortality and transfusion of allogeneic blood products (ABPs). For both outcomes, no difference was identified. For mortality, pooled odds ratio was 0.66 (95\% confidence interval, 0.29-1.49), with I2 = 0\%. Use of FDP is feasible, and no adverse events were reported. Animal data suggest similar results for coagulation and anti-inflammatory profiles for FP and FDP. CONCLUSION: Human data assessing FDP use in trauma report no difference in mortality and transfusion of ABPs in patients receiving FDP compared with FP. Data from animal trauma studies report no difference in coagulation factor and anti-inflammatory profiles between FP and FDP. Results should be interpreted with caution because most studies were observational and have heterogeneous population (military and civilian trauma) and a moderate risk of bias. Well-designed prospective observational studies or, preferentially, RCTs are warranted to answer FDP's effect on laboratory (coagulation factor levels), transfusion (number of ABPs), and clinical outcomes (organ dysfunction, length of stay, and mortality).

	abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus, one of the main contagious mastitis pathogens worldwide, is characterized for causing chronic intramammary infections that respond poorly to antimicrobial therapy, disseminating within the herd leading to high economic losses. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of phenotypic resistance to antimicrobial agents among S. aureus collected worldwide in the context of bovine intramammary infections between the years 1969-2020. A systematic review was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). One hundred and fifty-five articles were eligible for quantitative review. Most of studies included in this meta-analysis were from Europe (88), followed by Asia (56), Latin America (39), Africa (32), North America (26), and Oceania (8). The highest overall prevalence of resistant S. aureus was against penicillin (pestimate 0.451, CI95 \% 0.415-0.487), followed by clindamycin, erythromycin, and gentamycin (p-estimate = 0.149, 0.085, and 0.069, respectively). Ceftiofur and cephalotin presented the lowest overall prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR, p-estimate = 0.020 and 0.015, respectively). The AMR to almost all the antimicrobials evaluated presented an increasing pattern over time, more apparent from 2009 onwards. The antimicrobials with a higher increase in their AMR prevalence over time were clindamycin, gentamycin, and oxacillin. Africa, Asia and Latin America were the continents with higher AMR to most compounds included in this study. No differences in AMR were detected regarding the clinical origin of the isolates (subclinical vs clinical mastitis) for almost all antibiotics evaluated. Differences in the method for testing AMR (disc diffusion method vs minimum inhibitory concentration) and type of study design for monitoring AMR were detected underscoring the importance of these variables as critical factors to enable comparisons for evaluating emergence of AMR.},

Of 65 articles appraised, 44 studies were selected. Results were organized by timing of assessments, injury severity, and cognitive domains assessed. Differences in the course of cognitive performance were observed across injury severity groups and cognitive domains, with differential proportions of reports of improvement, decline, or no change over time. The evidence for genetic, sex-, age-, and injury-related factors as determinants of cognitive outcome was inconsistent. The non-uniform trajectory of cognitive performance post-TBI supports the notion that this construct is non-homogeneous, and that different factors influence its course.

	abstract = {Environmental enrichment promotes sensory and motor stimulation for species-typical behaviors, which in turn enhance animal well-being. For farmed Galliformes, housing systems often limit enrichment to bedding and litter, that simultaneously act as material for dustbathing and foraging. Therefore, this meta-analysis sought to systematically review and synthesize the substrate preference test literature for Galliformes. Data based on the following four welfare-related behaviors were extracted for analysis: (1) dustbathing, (2) foraging, (3) pecking, and (4) time spent on a given substrate. Literature searches in CAB Direct, Web of Science, and Google Scholar yielded 239 articles, and hand searching yielded an additional five articles. Ten publications that used different chicken strains as test subjects, met the criteria to be included in the systematic review. The effects of bedding type, the number of days birds had access to tested substrates, enclosure area, and substrate area, on the examined behaviors were determined. We found that birds preferred dustbathing in sand and peat moss more than on any other substrates. The bedding type, size of the enclosure, and size of the substrate area affected the amount of time that birds spent on the tested substrates. When provided the choice between bedding materials, birds spent more time on sand or peat moss than on any other substrate or on no substrate. Notably, most studies did not report relevant physical or chemical characteristics of substrate that may influence birds' preferences, such as grain size, moisture content and the level of soiling. Focusing future studies on identifying substrate characteristics that influence preferences can lead to the discovery of new, practical, enriching beddings that can be easily implemented in housing systems for Galliformes.},

	abstract = {Efforts to control and eliminate human schistosomiasis have accelerated over the past decade. In a number of endemic countries and settings, interruption of schistosome transmission has been achieved. In others, Schistosoma infections continue to challenge program managers at different levels, from the complexity of the transmission cycle, over limited treatment options and lack of field-friendly accurate diagnostics, to controversy around adequate intervention strategies. We conducted a landscape analysis on parasitic and vector-borne disease elimination approaches with the aim to identify evidence-based strategies, core components and key concepts for achieving and sustaining schistosomiasis control and for progressing elimination efforts towards interruption of transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 118 relevant publications were identified from Web of Science, Pubmed and the grey literature and reviewed for their content. In addition, we conducted in-depth interviews with 23 epidemiologists, program managers, policymakers, donors and field researchers. Available evidence emphasizes the need for comprehensive, multipronged and long-term strategies consisting of multiple complementary interventions that must be sustained over time by political commitment and adequate funding in order to reach interruption of transmission. Based on the findings of this landscape analysis, we propose a comprehensive set of intervention strategies for schistosomiasis control and elimination. Before deployment, the proposed interventions will require review, evaluation and validation in the frame of an expert consultation as a step towards adaptation to specific contexts, conditions and settings. Field testing to ensure local relevance and effectiveness is paramount given the diversity of socio-ecological and epidemiological contexts.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12936-019-2638-9},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria cases and deaths decreased dramatically in recent years, largely due to effective vector control interventions. Persistence of transmission after good coverage has been achieved with high-quality vector control interventions, namely insecticide-treated nets or indoor residual spraying, poses a significant challenge to malaria elimination efforts. To understand when and where remaining transmission is occurring, it is necessary to look at vector and human behaviour, and where they overlap. To date, a review of human behaviour related to residual malaria transmission has not been conducted. METHODS: Studies were identified through PubMed and Google Scholar. Hand searches were conducted for all references cited in articles identified through the initial search. The review was limited to English language articles published between 2000 and 2017. Publications with primary data from a malaria endemic setting in sub-Saharan Africa and a description of night time human behaviours were included. RESULTS: Twenty-six publications were identified that met inclusion criteria. Study results fit into two broad categories: when and where people are exposed to malaria vectors and what people are doing at night that may increase their contact with malaria vectors. Among studies that quantified human-vector interaction, a majority of exposure occurred indoors during sleeping hours for unprotected individuals, with some variation across time, contexts, and vector species. Common night time activities across settings included household chores and entertainment during evening hours, as well as livelihood and large-scale socio-cultural events that can last throughout the night. Shifting sleeping patterns associated with travel, visitors, illness, farming practices, and outdoor sleeping, which can impact exposure and use of prevention measures, were described in some locations. CONCLUSIONS: While the importance of understanding human-vector interaction is well-established, relatively few studies have included human behaviour when measuring exposure to malaria vectors. Broader application of a standardized approach to measuring human-vector interaction could provide critical information on exposure across settings and over time. In-depth understanding of night time activities that occur during times when malaria vectors are active and barriers to prevention practices in different contexts should also be considered. This information is essential for targeting existing interventions and development and deployment of appropriate complementary prevention tools.},

Treatment effects were evaluated using risk ratios for dichotomous data, together with 95\% CI. Data were pooled using the random-effects model. The quality of the evidence for each outcome was assessed using GRADE criteria. Twenty-four trials met inclusion criteria for systematic review, while fifteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Results showed no significant differences in the outcomes between PRP and control groups. Finally, there is no definitive evidence that PRP enhances tendons and ligaments healing. Therefore, there is a need for more controlled trials to draw a firmer conclusion about the efficacy of PRP as a treatment for tenodesmic lesions in the horse.},

This systematic review was performed to assess drugs or compounds that can be used as anti-T. gondii tissue cysts in vitro and in vivo. English electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science) were systematically searched for articles published up to 2017. A total of 55 papers published from 1987 to 2017 were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review. Among the drugs, atovaquone and azithromycin were found effective after long-term inoculation into mice; however, clinical cases of resistance to these drugs have been reported. Also, FR235222, QUI-11, tanshinone IIA, and hydroxyzine were shown to be effective against Toxoplasma cysts, but their effectiveness in vivo remains unknown. Additionally, compound 32, endochin-like quinolones, miltefosine, and guanabenz can be used as effective antiparasitic with the unique ability to reduce brain tissue cysts in chronically infected mice. Importantly, these antimicrobial agents are significant criteria for drug candidates. Future studies should focus on the biology and drug susceptibility of the cyst form of T. gondii in chronic toxoplasmosis patients to find more effective strategies that have sterilizing activity for eliminating T. gondii tissue cysts from the host, preventing disease relapse and potentially shortening the required duration of drug administration.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the global prevalence of T. gondii in species of the family Felidae. METHODS: We searched seven databases (PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Proquest and Web of Science) for studies reporting seroprevalence of T. gondii in felids from 1967 to 31 December 2017. A total of 217 published papers, containing 223 datasets were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis, comprised 59,517 domestic and 2733 wild cats from 1967 to 2017. RESULTS: The pooled global T. gondii seroprevalence was estimated to be 35\% (95\% CI: 32-38\%) and 59\% (95\% CI: 56-63\%) in domestic cats and wild felids, respectively, using random effects model. The seroprevalence was higher in Australia and Africa where the T. gondii seropositivity in domestic cats was 52\% (95\% CI: 15-89\%) and 51\% (95\% CI: 20-81\%), respectively. The lowest seroprevalence was estimated in Asia 27\% (95\% CI: 24-30\%). The seroprevalence values for T. gondii in wild felids were 74\% (95\% CI: 62-83\%) in Africa, 67\% (95\% CI: 23-111\%) in Asia, 67\% (95\% CI: 58-75\%) in Europe and 66\% (95\% CI: 41-91\%) in South America.

	abstract = {Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a psychophysical test used to quantify somatosensory sensation under normal or pathological conditions including osteoarthritis (OA). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies using QST in healthy and osteoarthritic cats, registered at Systematic Review Research Facility (\#26-06-2017). DESIGN: Hierarchical models with random intercepts for each individual study extracted through the systematic review were fit to subject-level data; QST measures were contrasted between healthy and osteoarthritic cats. Four bibliographic databases were searched; quality and risk of bias assessment were performed using pre-established criteria. RESULTS: Six articles were included; most were of high quality and low risk of bias. Punctate tactile threshold (n = 70) and mechanical temporal summation (n = 35) were eligible for analysis. Cats with OA have lower punctate tactile threshold [mean difference (95\%HDI): -44 (-60; -26) grams] and facilitated temporal summation of pain [hazard ratio (95\%HDI): 5.32 (2.19; 14) times] when compared with healthy cats. The effect of sex and body weight on sensory sensitivity remained inconclusive throughout all analyses. Due to the correlation between age and OA status, it remains difficult to assess the effect of OA on sensory sensitivity, independently of age. CONCLUSIONS: Clear and transparent reporting using guidelines are warranted. Similar to people, centralized sensitization is a feature of OA in cats. Future studies should try to elucidate the age effect on feline OA. Research with natural OA in cats is promising with potential to benefit feline health and welfare, and improve translatability to clinical research.},

The aim of this study was 2-fold: 1) to compile and summarize the evidence of animal studies that compare different forms to induce, treat (disease already established), or prevent (after trauma) TMJA; and 2) to address the following focused question: what is the quality of reporting in these studies? MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted. Animal studies conducted up to October 2019 comparing at least 2 procedures to induce, treat (disease already established), or prevent (after trauma) TMJA were considered. Compliance with the Animal Research Reporting In Vivo Experiments guidelines was checked for all studies. Studies evaluating treatment of TMJA or preventive measures also were evaluated using the SYstematic Review Center for Laboratory animal Experimentation's risk of bias tool for animal studies. RESULTS: A total of 24 studies were included. The studies were evaluated for feasibility regarding data synthesis, and a meta-analysis was not suitable because of methodological differences, mainly regarding the animal model chosen and surgical procedures performed to induce TMJA. In 17 articles, authors aimed to investigate different procedures to induce TMJA (fibrous, fibro-osseous, or bony). In 7 articles, different treatment or preventive strategies were compared. The sheep was the most used animal in models of TMJA. Only 25\% (6 of 24) of studies reported some step to minimize bias (ie, blinding of investigators, randomization procedures, or allocation concealment). Approximately 54\% (13 of 24) of articles clearly commented on study limitations and potential sources of bias. Further animal studies on TMJA should consider improving their reporting standards to increase their validity and improve the reproducibility of animal experiments.},

	abstract = {Housefly (Musca domestica) is an excellent candidate for the distribution of susceptible and resistant bacterial strains that potentially threaten public health. To date, there is a paucity of information on the global distribution of pathogenic bacteria of medical and veterinary importance from diverse environmental settings. Therefore, this study was undertaken to conduct a systemic review and meta-analysis to estimate occurrence of various bacterial species of medical and veterinary importance harboured by houseflies around the world. Published articles from 1980 to 2020 were retrieved from electronic databases and assessed for eligibility according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Seventy-eight studies were included in the review with only 44 studies being eligible for meta-analysis. Results indicated that eligible studies used in this review were from four continents, i.e., Asia (47.4\%) America (23.1\%), Africa (20.5\%) and Europe (8.9\%). The majority of the studies (56.4\%) used the culture method for the identification of bacterial pathogens, while 30.7\% used both culture and PCR techniques. For meta-analysis, we focused on five pathogenic bacterial species including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. High heterogeneity was found among studies investigating different pathogens including E. coli (Q = 10,739.55; I(2)  = 99.60; Q-p 0.0001), E. faecium (Q = 317.61; I(2)  = 86.46; Q-p {\textless} 0.0001), K. pneumonia (Q = 1,576.61; I(2)  = 97.27; Q-p {\textless} 0.0001), S. aureus (Q = 2,439.12; I(2)  = 98.24; Q-p {\textless} 0.0001) and P. aeruginosa (Q = 1,283.0; I(2)  = 96.65; Q-p {\textless} 0.0001). Furthermore, it was observed that houseflies carried a considerable number of susceptible and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains that pose considerable threats to public health. Findings from this study have provided more insight on the vectoral potential of houseflies in the transmission of significant bacterial pathogens from different regions across the world. Further investigation is required to quantify the bacterial contamination and dissemination by houseflies.},

Novel treatment options with limited side effects are currently being researched. Resveratrol is a polyphenol and phytoalexin found in the skins of grapes, red wine, Japanese knotweed, and peanuts. It has been studied extensively for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Resveratrol has also gained attention for its neuroprotective properties. The aim of the review was to examine the mechanisms by which resveratrol reduces depressive behaviors in animal models. In total, 22 studies met the established criteria for final review. Behavioral aspects of depression were investigated using validated measures such as the forced swimming test, tail suspension test, sucrose preference test, and open field test. While many physical measures were taken, three main biological mechanisms were explored: Regulation of the hypothalamic⁻pituitary⁻adrenal axis; decreased inflammation; and increased Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor and neurogenesis. Based on these findings, resveratrol may be deemed an effective treatment for depression in animal models at doses between 10⁻80 mg/kg/day, although higher doses had the most significant effects. Future studies should examine the effects of resveratrol on depression in humans to determine the eligibility of resveratrol as a natural antidepressant with less severe side effects.},

This systematic review was conducted to discover the potential roles of chromium on inflammatory biomarkers. Eligible studies were all in vitro, animal and human studies published in English-language journals from inception until October 2018. PubMed, Scopus, Embase, ProQuest and Google Scholar databases were searched to fined interventional studies from the effects of chromium on inflammatory biomarkers such as tumour necrosis factor a (TNF -a), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukins, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP -1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM -1) and adipocytokines in hyperglycaemia and diabetes. Out of 647 articles found in the search, only 14 articles were eligible for analysis, three in vitro studies, eight animal studies and three human studies. Twelve of the 14 studies included in this review, chromium significantly decreased inflammatory factors. The findings of this review indicate, based on in vitro and in vivo studies, that chromium might have potential anti-inflammatory properties, but some of the studies did not show anti-inflammatory effects for chromium (two studies). There are only three studies in humans with controversial results. Therefore, more consistent randomized double-blind controlled trials are needed to reach relevant clinical recommendations, as well as to determine the precise mechanism, of chromium on inflammation in diabetes.},

	abstract = {Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) during pregnancy has been associated with childhood obesity. Research in which rodent dams have been given high-fat/high-sugar diets has consistently found metabolic alterations in their offspring. However, what remains unclear is the potential impact on the developing fetus of giving sugar in isolation at concentrations similar to SSBs to the mothers. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (Protocol No: 127115 on Prospero) to identify potential relationships between maternal sucrose consumption and metabolic outcomes in offspring of rodent (rat or mouse) models. We analysed studies that provided rodent mothers dams with access to sucrose solutions (8-20\% w/v) prior to conception, during pregnancy and/or lactation and that reported offspring outcomes of body weight (BW), body composition and glycaemic control. Following a systematic search of four databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Scopus) performed on 15 January 2019, maternal and offspring data from 15 papers were identified for inclusion. Only rat studies were identified. Meta-analyses were performed on standardised mean differences for maternal and offspring BW and fasting glucose levels, with subgroup analyses of strain, sucrose concentration, exposure period and sex of offspring. A bias towards the inclusion of only data from male offspring was identified and this limited interpretation of potential sexually dimorphic outcomes. Maternal sucrose exposure was associated with an increased risk of obesity and poor glucose disposal in adult and aged offspring.},

	abstract = {Little is known about possible effects of maternal non-nutritive sweetener (NNS) consumption on the metabolic health of a child. Animal models of maternal NNS consumption during pregnancy or weaning have yielded widely varying results, and there appears to be no clear consensus on the consequences for offspring body weight, glycaemic control or sweet preference choices. Moreover, heterogeneity in study design has hampered a clear focus for future research relevant to human health. In an effort to bring clarity, we have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (protocol no: CRD42018109509) in animal models (rat or mouse) of maternal NNS feeding (compared to water or basal diet) during pre-gestation, pregnancy or lactation. Four databases were searched from inception to 15th September 2018: PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS and Web of Science. We present maternal and offspring data from 24 included studies, which have been quantitatively analysed after study quality assessment, to identify relationships between maternal diet and offspring body weight (BW), feeding behaviour and glycaemic control. In 11 data sets, exposure to NNS reduced maternal BW during pregnancy, with no effect on litter outcomes. Meta-analyses on offspring BW during weaning (1123 offspring) and adulthood (646 offspring) identified small decreases in BW for both sexes. Subgroup analyses revealed reductions in BW of rat, but not mouse models. High dosage appears to be a potential factor for reduced palatability that could influence BW results; however, a lack of reported data limited our ability to confirm. Despite this, and the fact many papers were predisposed to bias, the balance of evidence suggests a maternal NNS diet during pregnancy or lactation did not increase the body weight in offspring.},

	abstract = {Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by helminths of the genus Schistosoma with two presentations; one intestinal and another urinary; which depend on the specie of Schistosoma. One of the species that can produce intestinal schistosomiasis is Schistosoma mansoni, and the specie that produces urinary schistosomiasis is Schistosoma haematobium. Infection can be aggravated by a deficient nutritional status, which negatively impacts the immune system and increases susceptibility to infection. The main objective of this meta-analysis is to determine if a relationship exists between multimicronutrient supplementation and the reduction of infestation with Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium in children and adolescents. A search was conducted through a scientific literature database, and articles that complied with the pre-established requirements were retrieved. The Review Manager (Rev Man) 5.3 computer program was used for data processing and analysis was carried out with the objective of testing whether the addition of micronutrient supplementation to treatment with broad-spectrum antiparasitic anthelmintic medication has an impact on schistosomiasis infection. Of the 257 initial articles retrieved, eight were included both quantitatively and qualitatively in the meta-analysis. Supplementation reduces infestation with Schistosoma spp 1.33 times more than placebo. In individuals infested with Schistosoma, mansoni supplementation is 1.30 times more effective than placebo and for individuals infested with Schistosoma haematobium, supplementation is 1.62 times more effective than the placebo. The results show a clear relationship between supplementation and reduction of infestation. The supplementation with micronutrients decreases the presence of Schistosoma spp in children and adolescents.},

	abstract = {Listeriosis is a rare but severe foodborne illness which is more common in populations such as pregnant women, and can result in serious complications including miscarriage, prematurity, maternal and neonatal sepsis, and death in the newborn. Population recommendations exist for specific foods and food preparation practices to reduce listeriosis risk during pregnancy. The aim of the present systematic review was to assess the association between listeriosis and these practices during pregnancy to confirm appropriateness of these recommendations. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, Web of Science Core Collection, included articles' references, and contacted clinical experts. All databases were searched until July 2017. Case-control and cohort studies were included which assessed pregnant women or their newborn offspring with known listeriosis status and a nutritional exposure consistent with international population recommendations for minimising listeriosis. Outcomes included listeriosis with or without pregnancy outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed through the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results were described narratively due to clinical heterogeneity in differences in nutritional exposures. Eleven articles comprising case-control or cross-sectional studies met the inclusion criteria. Cases of maternal, fetal or neonate listeriosis were more likely to have consumed high-risk dairy products, meat products or some fruits during pregnancy in comparison with women without listeriosis. Cases of listeriosis were more likely to have consumed foods that are highlighted in population guidelines to avoid to minimise listeriosis in comparison with those without listeriosis during pregnancy. Further research is warranted assessing means of improving the reach, uptake and generalisability of population guidelines for reducing listeriosis during pregnancy.},

Sclerotherapy (ST) and prolotherapy (PT) are two promising options among the numerous other conservative therapies. As their efficacy and potential adverse effects (AE) are still unclear, we systematically searched, analyzed, and synthesized the available literature on ST and PT for treating AT. Electronic databases, Google Scholar and articles' reference lists were searched according to PRISMA guidelines. Eligibility criteria were set up according to the PICOS-scheme including human and animal studies. Three authors independently reviewed the results and evaluated methodological quality (Coleman Methodology Score and Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment). The initial search yielded 1104 entries. After screening, 18 articles were available for qualitative synthesis, six of which were subjected to meta-analysis. The mean Coleman Score of the 13 human studies was 50. Four RCTs were ranked as having a low risk of selection bias. Three of those reported a statistically significant drop in the visual analog scale (VAS) score, one a significant increase in the VISA-A Score. 12 of 13 human studies reported positive results in achieving pain relief and patient satisfaction, whereas only one study's finding differed. Meta-analysis revealed an unambiguous result in favor of the intervention (weighted mean difference D=-4.67 cm, 95\% CI -5.56 to -3.76 cm [P{\textless}.001]). Only one serious AE and two minor AEs were reported in the entire literature. This systematic review suggests that ST and PT may be effective treatment options for AT and that they can be considered safe. Long-term studies and RCTs are still needed to support their recommendation.},

Of the 64 pre-selected articles, only articles presenting the coefficients of variation and/or standard deviations according to the litter size and different levels of amino acid supplementation in the sow diets during gestation were selected. The average birth weights of total and live piglets were 43\% lower in litters from sows with high prolificacy than those from sows with low prolificacy. The weight variability was affected by high prolificacy sows, with increases of 4.04\% and 4.54\% in the coefficients of variation of total and born alive piglets respectively (p = .074; p = .009). The standard deviation increased by 180 g in born alive piglets to high prolificacy sows. The coefficients of variation of total and live piglets born from high prolificacy sows showed an increase of 4.04\% and 4.54\% respectively (p = .07; p {\textless} .05). There was a tendency for reduced weight variability with amino acids supplementation when considering the standard deviation of total born (p = .072). However, reproductive performance was not significantly influenced (p {\textgreater} .05). In conclusion, the average litter weight and the number of piglets born influence weight variability. Amino acids supplementation may reduce the birth weight variability between piglets. However, this effect depends on the amino acid used, the levels of supplementation and on other factors not completely addressed in this study. Thus, more research is necessary to fully elucidate this topic.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several pharmacological therapeutic approaches have been proposed to manage osteoarthritis (OA), including intra-articular (IA) injections. Although the discovery of clodronate, a bisphosphonate, dates back to the 1960s and the effects of its IA administration have been investigated for decades in animal models, mechanisms of action of this drug are not quite clear, particularly in OA. This scoping review is an overview of the biological as well as the clinical role of clodronic acid in OA. METHOD: A scoping review based on the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) model was performed to characterize the mechanisms of action of IA clodronate in OA and to evaluate its efficacy from a clinical point of view. RESULTS: Several effects of clodronate have been observed in animal models of OA, including depletion of synovial lining cells that results in reduced production of chemokines (IL-1, TNF- α), growth factors (TGF-β, BMP 2/4), and metalloproteases (MMP 2/3/9); prevention of cartilage damage, synovial hyperplasia, and proteoglycans loss; reduction in joint inflammation, joint swelling, and osteophyte formation. From a clinical perspective, patients with knee OA treated with IA clodronate experienced improvements in pain and joint mobility. CONCLUSION: Clodronate appears to have different mechanisms of action interfering with the pathogenic processes contributing to OA development and progression. This intervention demonstrated positive effects for patients affected by knee OA.},

Nevertheless, MSC recruitment appears to be slow and limits bone formation in DO defects. Thus, this systematic review aims to evaluate the ability of locally applied MSC to enhance bone formation in DO preclinical models. Databases were searched for quantitative pre-clinical controlled studies that evaluated the effect of local administration of MSC on DO bone formation. Eligible studies were identified and data regarding study characteristics, outcome measures and quality were extracted. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Autogenous and xenogenous MSC were used to promote DO bone formation. These included bone marrow-derived MSC, adipose tissue-derived MSC and MSC derived from human exfoliated deciduous teeth. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneities in study designs. Local MSC implantation was not associated with adverse effects. In 4 out of the 5 studies, locally delivered undifferentiated bone-marrow MSC had a positive effect on DO bone formation. Few studies evaluated the therapeutic effects of MSC from other sources. The adjunct use of biologically active molecules or forced expression of key genes involved in osteogenesis further boosted the ability of bone-marrow MSC to promote DO bone formation. While risk of bias and heterogeneity limited the strength of this systematic review, our results suggest that the use of MSC is safe and may provide beneficial effects on DO bone formation.},

	abstract = {Histidine is an essential amino acid (EAA) in mammals, fish, and poultry. We aim to give an overview of the metabolism and physiological effects of histidine in humans and different animal species through a systematic review following the guidelines of PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). In humans, dietary histidine may be associated with factors that improve metabolic syndrome and has an effect on ion absorption. In rats, histidine supplementation increases food intake. It also provides neuroprotection at an early stage and could protect against epileptic seizures. In chickens, histidine is particularly important as a limiting factor for carnosine synthesis, which has strong anti-oxidant effects. In fish, dietary histidine may be one of the most important factors in preventing cataracts. In ruminants, histidine is a limiting factor for milk protein synthesis and could be the first limiting AA for growth. In excess, histidine supplementation can be responsible for eating and memory disorders in humans and can induce growth retardation and metabolic dysfunction in most species. To conclude, the requirements for histidine, like for other EAA, have been derived from growth and AA composition in tissues and also have specific metabolic roles depending on species and dietary levels.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Due to its high complexity, neurosurgery consists of a demanding learning curve that requires intense training and a deep knowledge of neuroanatomy. Microsurgical skill development can be achieved through various models of simulation, but as human cadaveric models are not always accessible, cadaveric animal models can provide a reliable environment in which to enhance the acquisition of surgical dexterity. The aim of this review was to analyse the current role of animal brains in laboratory training and to assess their correspondence to the procedures performed in humans. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Pubmed literature search was performed to identify all the articles concerning training cranial and spinal techniques on large animal heads. The search terms were 'training model', and 'neurosurgery' in association with 'animal', 'sheep', 'cow', and 'swine'. The exclusion criteria were articles that were on human brains, experimental fundamental research, or on virtual simulators. RESULTS: The search retrieved 119 articles, of which 25 were relevant to the purpose of this review. Owing to their similar neuroanatomy, bovine, porcine and ovine models prove to be reliable structures in simulating neurosurgical procedures. On bovine skulls, an interhemispheric transcalosal and retrosigmoid approach along with different approaches to the Circle of Willis can be recreated. Ovine model procedures have varied from lumbar discectomies on sheep spines to craniosynostosis surgery, whereas in ex vivo swine models, cadaveric dissections of lateral sulcus, median and posterior fossa have been achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Laboratory training models enhance surgical advancements by familiarising trainee surgeons with certain neuroanatomical structures and promoting greater surgical dexterity. The accessibility of animal brains allows trainee surgeons to exercise techniques outside the operating theatre, thus optimising outcomes in human surgical procedures.},

After a systematic review of studies published since 2000, two independent reviewers assessed the eligibility of each one based on predefined inclusion criteria. We extracted information on the study design, insects, avian species, and growth performances, i.e., average daily gain, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio. Next, we estimated pooled differences between performances of poultry fed a diet with vs. without insects through random-effects meta-analysis models. Additionally, these models evaluated the effects of potential sources of heterogeneity across studies. Of the 75 studies reviewed, 41 met the inclusion criteria and included 174 trials. With respect to diets without insects, pooled differences in growth performances were statistically not different from the null, but heterogeneity was marked across studies. Average daily gain decreased with increasing inclusion rates of insects, going below the null for rates of 10\% and more. Grasshoppers were negatively associated with the average daily gain and positively associated with feed intake. The country of publication was another source of heterogeneity across publications. Overall, our results show insects should substitute only partially conventional protein sources and not be grasshoppers to guarantee the appropriate growth of birds.},

This study aimed to summarize previous investigations on the association between total, animal and plant proteins intake and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and hypertension (HTN) in adults. METHODS: Related papers were found by searching through PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar up to April 2020. Prospective cohort studies examined the association between consumption of the dietary protein from different sources and the risk of CHD and HTN in general population, were included. The random-effects model was used to pool the reported relative risks (RR). Dose-response associations were modeled by restricted cubic splines. RESULTS: Thirteen prospective studies, in total, including 547,303 participants- 11,590 cases with total CHD and 5,620 with HTN- were included. Dietary intake of total protein was not significantly associated with the risk of total CHD (RR: 0.97; 95\%CI: 0.90-1.05) and HTN (RR: 1.01; 95\% CI: 0.90-1.14). Moreover, consumption of both dietary plant and animal protein was not related to the risk of total CHD and HTN. Dose-response analysis indicated that the risk of CHD and HTN did not change significantly with increasing dietary total protein intake from 10\% to 25\% of total calorie intake. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary protein intake from different sources had no significant association with risk of CHD and HTN. Further high-quality research is needed to examine the potential mechanistic links between dietary protein intake and health outcomes.},

	abstract = {Clinical studies report that low circulating angiopoietin-1 concentration at presentation predicts worse outcomes after ischaemic stroke. Upregulating angiopoietin-1 may therefore have therapeutic benefit for ischaemic stroke. This systematic review assessed whether upregulating angiopoietin-1 improved outcomes in rodent models of ischaemic stroke. Random-effects models quantified the effect of angiopoietin-1 upregulation on stroke severity in terms of the size of cerebral infarction and the extent of blood-brain barrier permeability. Eleven studies utilising rat and mouse models of ischaemic stroke fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses demonstrated that angiopoietin-1 upregulation significantly reduced cerebral infarction size (standardised mean difference: -3.02; 95\% confidence intervals: -4.41, -1.63; p {\textless} 0.001; n = 171 animals) and improved blood-brain barrier integrity (standardized mean difference: -2.02; 95\% confidence intervals: -3.27, -0.77; p = 0.002; n = 129 animals). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that angiopoietin-1 upregulation improved outcomes in models of transient, not permanent cerebral ischaemia. Six studies assessed the effect of angiopoietin-1 upregulation on neurological function; however, inter-study heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis. In conclusion, published rodent data suggest that angiopoietin-1 upregulation improves outcome following temporary cerebral ischaemia by reducing cerebral infarction size and improving blood-brain barrier integrity. Additional research is required to examine the effect of angiopoietin-1 upregulation on neurological function during stroke recovery and investigate the benefit and risks in patients.},

We aimed to conduct a systematic review and summarize published articles on the association between fish consumption and dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs with the risk of IBD. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were used to conduct a comprehensive search and identify eligible literature published prior to January 2019. Fixed-effects model or random-effects models (DerSimonian-Laird method) were applied to pool the effect sizes. Cochrane Q test was used to trace the potential source of heterogeneity across studies. RESULTS: 12 studies (5 prospective and 7 case-control) were included in the systematic review, which ten of them were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Studies were included a total sample size of 282610 participants which 2002 of them were cases of IBD [1061 Crohn's disease (CD) and 937 ulcerative colitis (UC)]. A negative association was found between fish consumption and the incidence of CD (pooled effect size: 0.54, 95\%CI: 0.31-0.96, P = 0.03). There was no relationship between total dietary n-3 PUFAs intake and IBD (pooled effect size: 1.17, 95\%CI: 0.80-1.72, P = 0.41). A significant inverse association was observed between dietary long-chain n-3 PUFAs and the risk of UC (pooled effect size: 0.75, 95\%CI: 0.57-0.98, P = 0.03). Moreover, no association was found between α-Linolenic acid (ALA) and IBD (pooled effect size: 1.17, 95\%CI: 0.63-2.17, P = 0.62). CONCLUSIONS: Findings showed a negative association between fish consumption and the risk of CD.

	abstract = {The significance of hepatitis E virus (HEV) as an important public health problem is rising. Until a decade ago, cases of HEV infection in Eur-ope were mainly confined to returning travelers, but nowadays, hepatitis E represents an emerging zoonotic infection in many European countries. The aim of this manuscript is to perform a systematic review of the published literature on hepatitis E distribution in humans, animals and environmental samples ("One Health" concept) in the South-Eastern European countries. Comparison of the available data showed that the anti-HEV seroprevalence in the South-Eastern Europe varies greatly, depending on the population studied, geographical area and methods used. The IgG seroprevalence rates in different population groups were found to be 1.1\%-24.5\% in Croatia, up to 20.9\% in Bulgaria, 5.9-\%17.1\% in Romania, 15\% in Serbia, up to 9.7\% in Greece and 2\%-9.7\% in Albania. Among possible risk factors, older age was the most significant predictor for HEV seropositivity in most studies. Higher seroprevalence rates were found in animals. HEV IgG antibodies in domestic pigs were detected in 20\%-54.5\%, 29.2\%-50\%, 38.94\%-50\% and 31.1\%-91.7\% in Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia, respectively. In wild boars seroprevalence rates were up to 10.3\%, 30.3\% and 31.1\% in Romania, Slovenia and Croatia, respectively. A high HEV RNA prevalence in wild boars in some countries (Croatia and Romania) indicated that wild boars may have a key role in the HEV epidemiology. There are very few data on HEV prevalence in environmental samples. HEV RNA was detected in 3.3\% and 16.7\% surface waters in Slovenia and Serbia, respectively. There is no evidence of HEV RNA in sewage systems in this region. The available data on genetic characterization show that human, animal and environmental HEV strains mainly belong to the genotype 3.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Foodborne Neglected Zoonotic Helminths (FNZH) are parasites of both economic and public health importance. They include Taenia solium, Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato, Echinococcus multilocularis and Foodborne trematodes (FBT). FNZH are earmarked for major interventions for control, elimination and eradication. This systematic review highlights the progress towards development of rapid tests for the diagnosis of FNZH since 2010 when they were listed as neglected tropical diseases. METHODOLOGY: A systematic search was conducted in three databases, World of Science, Embase and PubMed using the same search phrase. The search produced 480 hits. Three studies from back referencing were included. Only 22 of these met the inclusion criteria. Data was extracted from these and presented qualitatively. RESULTS: Twenty-five rapid diagnostic tests were found to have been developed since 2010, eight for diagnosis of T. solium infections, eight for echinococcosis and nine for FBT infections. The rapid tests for diagnosing T. solium infections included six antibody detecting and two antigen detecting tests. They constitute a combination among them, with some tests providing qualitative, others quantitative results. Similarly, seven out of the eight rapid tests developed for Echinococcus infections were antibody detecting tests save for one loop mediated isothermal amplification test. All of them were qualitative tests. For FBT infections, nine rapid tests were described; two antibody and one nucleic acid detecting test for diagnosis of Fascioliasis; three nucleic acid detecting tests for Opisthorchiasis; one antibody detecting test for Paragonimiasis; and for Clonorchiasis, one antibody and one nucleic acid detecting test. The FBT infection rapid tests were all qualitative in nature. Most of these tests have not undergone field evaluation in endemic areas where they will be used most. CONCLUSION: This review describes the development and evaluation of rapid diagnostic tests, while highlighting the need for in depth validations of the tools to determine how well they can perform in endemic areas.},

	abstract = {Viral infections are being managed therapeutically through available antiviral regimens with unsatisfactory clinical outcomes. The refractory viral infections resistant to available antiviral drugs are alarming threats and a serious health concern. For viral hepatitis, the interferon and vaccine therapies solely are not ultimate solutions due to recurrence of hepatitis C virus. Owing to the growing incidences of viral infections and especially of resistant viral strains, the available therapeutic modalities need to be improved, complemented with the discovery of novel antiviral agents to combat refractory viral infections. It is widely accepted that medicinal plant heritage is nature gifted, precious, and fueled with the valuable resources for treatment of metabolic and infectious disorders. The aims of this review are to assemble the facts and to conclude the therapeutic potential of medicinal plants in the eradication and management of various viral diseases such as influenza, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), hepatitis, and coxsackievirus infections, which have been proven in diverse clinical studies. The articles, published in the English language since 1982 to 2017, were included from Web of Science, Cochrane Library, AMED, CISCOM, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, and PubMed by using relevant keywords including plants possessing antiviral activity, the antiviral effects of plants, and plants used in viral disorders. The scientific literature mainly focusing on plant extracts and herbal products with therapeutic efficacies against experimental models of influenza, HIV, HSV, hepatitis, and coxsackievirus were included in the study. Pure compounds possessing antiviral activity were excluded, and plants possessing activity against viruses other than viruses in inclusion criteria were excluded. Hundreds of plant extracts with antiviral effect were recognized. However, the data from only 36 families investigated through in vitro and in vivo studies met the inclusion criteria of this review. The inferences from scientific literature review, focusing on potential therapeutic consequences of medicinal plants on experimental models of HIV, HSV, influenza, hepatitis, and coxsackievirus have ascertained the curative antiviral potential of plants. Fifty-four medicinal plants belonging to 36 different families having antiviral potential were documented. Out of 54 plants, 27 individually belong to particular plant families. On the basis of the work of several independent research groups, the therapeutic potential of medicinal plants against listed common viral diseases in the region has been proclaimed. In this context, the herbal formulations as alternative medicine may contribute to the eradication of complicated viral infection significantly. The current review consolidates the data of the various medicinal plants, those are Sambucus nigra, Caesalpinia pulcherrima, and Hypericum connatum, holding promising specific antiviral activities scientifically proven through studies on experimental animal models. Consequently, the original research addressing the development of novel nutraceuticals based on listed medicinal plants is highly recommended for the management of viral disorders.},

A Scopus, Ovid, PubMed, and Web of Science (WoS), search yielded 29 results using the keywords "amyloid beta", "intermittent fasting", "intermittent caloric restriction", "alternate day fasting", "modified alternate-day fasting", "time-restricted feeding", "Ramadan fast", "intermittent calori* restriction", "intermittent restrictive diet", and "Alzheimer*". Five research articles addressed directly the effects of intermittent fasting on beta-amyloid levels in animal models of AD: alternate day fasting (ADF) and time-restricted feeding (TRF) methods were incorporated in these studies. The study designs were found to be heterogeneous. Variations in the levels of beta-amyloid peptides or plaque in either the hippocampus, cortical areas, or both in animals following dietary intervention were observed as compared to the ad libitum group. Non-significant changes were observed in three studies, while two studies interestingly demonstrated amelioration and reduction in beta-amyloid levels. Given the conflicting results obtained from this study, significant care has to be taken into consideration before the protocol can be applied as a preventative approach to treat Alzheimer's disease. Longitudinal research is warranted to fully grasp how dietary habits can help alleviate the disease either through upstream or downstream of AD pathology.},

	abstract = {Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and secretome are promising therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This meta-analysis aimed to provide a precise estimate and compare the therapeutic efficacy of MSC and secretome in PAH. We searched six databases (CINAHL, Cochrane, Ovid Medline, PubMed, Science Direct and Scopus) until December 2018 using search terms related to MSCs, secretome and PAH. Twenty-three studies were included for the meta-analysis. The effect size of pulmonary hemodynamics and right ventricular hypertrophy markers was estimated using random effects model. MSCs and secretome significantly improved pulmonary hemodynamics and right ventricular hypertrophy compared to control. Comparison between MSCs and secretome indicate no significant difference in reducing right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and medial wall thickening (MWT). However, treatment of PAH with secretome significantly improved mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) (p = 0.018) and right ventricular/left ventricular + septum (RV/LV+S) (p = 0.017) better than MSCs. Meta-regression shows that cell type (p = 0.034) is a predictor of MSCs to reduce RVSP in PAH. Similarly, the effect of secretome on MWT was significantly (p = 0.011) better at 4 weeks compared to 2 weeks of intervention. The overall risk of bias ranges from low to moderate; however, some of the essential elements required in reports of animal trials were not reported. There was evidence of publication bias for RV/LV+S and MWT, but not RVSP. This meta-analysis provides evidence of the therapeutic benefits of MSCs and secretome in PAH and the effect of secretome was similar or superior to MSCs.},

Stem cell therapy is evolving rapidly as an alternative for tissue regeneration. However, increasing evidence suggests that the regenerative ability of stem cells is mainly mediated by paracrine actions of secretome that are generally secreted by the cells. We aimed to systematically evaluate the efficacy of dental stem cell (DSC)-conditioned medium in in vivo animal models of various tissue defects. A total of 15 eligible studies was included by searching Pubmed, Scopus and Medline databases up to August 2017. The risk of bias was assessed using the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation risk of bias tool. Of 15 studies, seven reported the therapeutic benefit of the conditioned medium on neurological diseases and three reported on joint/bone-related defects. Two interventions were on liver diseases, whereas the remaining three addressed myocardial infarction and reperfusion, lung injury and diabetes. Nine studies were performed using mouse models and the remaining six studies used rat models. The methodological quality of the studies was low, as most of the key elements required in reports of preclinical studies were not reported. The findings of this review suggested that conditioned medium from DSCs improved tissue regeneration and functional recovery. This current review strengthens the therapeutic benefit of cell-free product for tissue repair in animal models. A well-planned study utilizing validated outcome measures and long-term safety studies are required for possible translation to clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) infection is one of the major causes of diarrheal disease throughout the world. In recent years, an increase in human S. Javiana infection has been reported from the southern part of the United States. However, the sources and routes of transmission of this Salmonella serotype are not well understood. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature to identify risk factors for human S. Javiana infection. Using PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search in Web of Science, PubMed, and the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Searches returned 63 potential articles, of which 12 articles met all eligibility criteria and were included in this review. A review of the literature indicated that both food and non-food (such as animal contact) exposures are responsible for the transmission of S. Javiana infection to humans. Consumption of fresh produce (tomatoes and watermelons), herbs (paprika-spice), dairy products (cheese), drinking contaminated well water and animal contact were associated with human S. Javiana infections. Based on the findings of this study, control of human S. Javiana infection should include three factors, (a) consumption of drinking water after treatment, (b) safe animal contact, and (c) safe food processing and handling procedures. The risk factors of S. Javiana infections identified in the current study provide helpful insight into the major vehicles of transmission of S. Javiana. Eventually, this will help to improve the risk management of this Salmonella serotype to reduce the overall burden of NTS infection in humans.},

The aim of this systematic review was to compare immunogenicity and protective efficacy of various SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates tested in non-human primate (NHP) models. METHODS: Literature on effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in NHP models reported on PubMed and preprint platforms (medRxiv and bioRxiv) till October 22, 2020, was searched with the following terms: coronavirus vaccine, COVID-19 vaccine, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, nonhuman primate, and rhesus macaque. RESULTS: Our search yielded 19 studies, which reported immune response elicited by 18 vaccine candidates in NHP. All the vaccines induced detectable neutralizing antibody (NAb) titres in the serum of vaccinated animals, with some showing effective viral clearance from various organs. The vaccinated animals also showed nil to mild histopathological changes in their lungs compared to placebo groups in the trials that performed necropsy. INTERPRETATION \& CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlighted onset of quick immunogenicity and protective efficacy of mRNA-1273, followed by Ad26.CoV2.S, NVX-CoV2373, BNT162b2, RBD and BBV152 vaccine candidates in preclinical trials as compared to the others. NHP data also showed correlation with clinical trial data available for a few vaccines. Preclinical trials of COVID-19 vaccine candidates in NHPs yielded promising results, with some candidates faring better than others.},

Here, we systematically reviewed the current evidence that food animals are responsible for transfer of AMR to humans. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE for literature published between 1940 and 2016. Our results show that eight studies (18\%) suggested evidence of transmission of AMR from food animals to humans, 25 studies (56\%) suggested transmission between animals and humans with no direction specified and 12 studies (26\%) did not support transmission. Quality of evidence was variable among the included studies; one study (2\%) used high resolution typing tools, 36 (80\%) used intermediate resolution typing tools, six (13\%) relied on low resolution typing tools, and two (5\%) based conclusions on co-occurrence of resistance. While some studies suggested to provide evidence that transmission of AMR from food animals to humans may occur, robust conclusions on the directionality of transmission cannot be drawn due to limitations in study methodologies. Our findings highlight the need to combine high resolution genomic data analysis with systematically collected epidemiological evidence to reconstruct patterns of AMR transmission between food animals and humans.},

CONCLUSIONS: The evidence from these trials suggests that propolis is the best of all natural possibilities in the treatment of herpetic skin lesions, especially those related to HSV-1. Future studies should analyse if propolis could be an adjunct to treatment with acyclovir. For lesions in the oral cavity, honey could be an interesting alternative.},

GP63 of New World Leishmania species is a parasite metalloproteases involved in the degradation and cleavage of many biological molecules as kappa-B nuclear factor, fibronectin, tyrosine phosphatases. GP63 is capable of inhibiting the activity of the complement system and reduces the host's immune functions, allowing the survival of the parasite and its dissemination. High serological/tissue levels of host matrix metalloproteases (MMP)-9 have been associated with tissue damage during the infection, while high transcriptional levels of MMP-2 related with a satisfactory response to treatment. Host MMPs serological and tissue levels have been investigated using Western Blot, zymography, and Real Time polymerase chain reaction. GP63 detection characterizes species and virulence in promastigotes isolated from lesions samples using techniques mentioned previously. The monitoring of host MMPs levels and GP63 in Leishmania isolated from host samples could be used on the laboratory routine to predict the prognostic and treatment efficacy of ATL.},

The oncogenic effect of several miRNAs has been recently ruled out. In order to act on miRNAs turnover, antagomiRs have been developed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The systematic review was conducted under the PRISMA guidelines (registration number is: CRD42019134173). The PubMed database was searched between 1 January 2000 and 30 April 2019 under the following search strategy: (((antagomiR) OR (mirna antagonists) OR (mirna antagonist)) AND ((lung[MeSH Terms]) OR ("lung diseases"[MeSH Terms]))). We included original articles, published in English, whereas exclusion criteria included reviews, meta-analyses, single case reports, and studies published in a language other than English. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A total of 68 articles matching the inclusion criteria were retrieved. Overall, the use of antagomiR was seen to be efficient in downregulating the specific miRNA they are conceived for. The usefulness of antagomiRs was demonstrated in humans, animal models, and cell lines. To our best knowledge, this is the first article to encompass evidence regarding miRNAs and their respective antagomiRs in the lung, in order to provide readers a comprehensive review upon major lung disorders.},

However, the mechanisms underlying these observations are not well understood. The purpose of this scoping review is to provide an update on what is currently known about the regulation of energetics and body fat after surgical manipulations of adipose tissue in small mammals. METHODS: PubMed and Scopus were searched to identify 64 eligible studies. Outcome measures included body fat, body weight, food intake, and circulating biomarkers. RESULTS: Surgeries performed included lipectomy (72\%) or transplantation (12\%) in mice (35\%), rats (35\%), and other small mammals. Findings suggested that lipectomy did not have consistent long-term effects on reducing body weight and fat because regain occurred within 12 to 14 weeks post surgery. Hence, biological feedback mechanisms act to resist long-term changes of body weight or fat. Furthermore, whether this weight and fat regain occurred because of "passive" and "active" regulation under the "set point" or "settling point" theories cannot fully be discerned because of limitations in study designs and data collected. CONCLUSIONS: The regulation of energetics and body fat are complex and dynamic processes that require further studies of the interplay of genetic, physiological, and behavioral factors.},

The objective was to evaluate the effects of oxytocin and carbetocin on farrowing duration, birth interval, farrowing assistance, stillbirth rate, and piglet viability traits by performing a systematic review and a meta-analysis. The search for studies was performed during January 2020 using the PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Science Direct, and Scopus databases. The literature search was conducted using the key words: oxytocin, pig, farrowing, stillbirth, piglet, dose, and carbetocin. Studies which evaluated the effects of oxytocin or carbetocin on farrowing duration, birth interval, stillbirth rate, and farrowing assistance were included in the review. Of 1215 articles, 23 (1.9\%) were selected for fulfilling the criteria for inclusion in the present study. A high variety of doses was observed among studies. Oxytocin increased (30\%; P {\textless} 0.05) the stillborn proportion in the litters compared to control sows. Both oxytocin and carbetocin increased the need of farrowing assistance by 137\% (P {\textless} 0.01) and 40\% (P {\textless} 0.05), respectively, compared to control. The use of oxytocin reduced the farrowing duration by 18\% and the birth interval by 17\%, while carbetocin reduced the same responses by 27 and 23\%, respectively (P {\textless} 0.01). When used judiciously, uterotonics are a valuable tool to shorten farrowing duration of hyperprolific sows. However, the treatment is not exempt of deleterious effects for piglets and sows. Therefore, the criteria to use these drugs should be based on individual cases and not as part of hormonal protocols for all parturient sows.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Concepts that showed substantial efficacy in animal models of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) often failed to improve outcome in humans with aneurysmal SAH. The concept of "comparative medicine," an open-minded comparison across species, might offer an alternative to the "constructed" animal models' approach. Naturally occurring diseases in animals might bear more similarity to human diseases than models. In this context, the question arises whether spontaneous intracranial aneurysms exist in animals or not, and whether they cause SAH or not. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed. Only articles dealing with natural aneurysms and/or SAH of mammals other than man were included. All articles dealing with induced aneurysms and/or SAH were removed. RESULTS: Of 2812 screened articles, 9 articles describing natural intracranial aneurysms and/or SAH were found. In total 1979 individual animals of 29 species were examined. Natural intracranial aneurysms were described in 7 individual animals of 6 species. Spontaneous SAH was described in 3 species. In 1 chimpanzee, a ruptured intracranial aneurysm caused an SAH. Histological descriptions of the aneurysms were strikingly similar to those of humans. CONCLUSIONS: Although interesting and innovative, the concept of "comparative medicine" seems to be impracticable due to the seemingly ultralow incidence of natural aneurysmal SAH in mammals other than man. The answer to the question "why intracranial aneurysms are less common in animals despite the strong histological similarity of cerebral arteries" might be a key issue. Last but not least, primates likely matter in SAH-related research, as aneurysmal SAH occurs in primates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is prevalent amongst athletic and non-athletic populations with pain, stiffness and impaired function typically reported. While different management options exist, loading protocols remain the best available intervention and have been shown to be effective in the management of AT. Trials investigating loading in AT have used a variety of different protocols, and recent narrative reviews suggest that no protocol is superior to another when comparing outcomes in pain and function. However, there has been no systematic review or meta-analysis completed to determine this. Furthermore, the narrative review did not consider wait-and-see or sham interventions, thus a systematic review and met-analysis which includes wait-and-see or sham interventions is warranted. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analyses will be conducted as per the PRISMA guidelines. The databases PUBMED, CINAHL (Ovid) and CINAHL (EBSCO) will be searched for articles published from inception to 31 December 2017. Our search focuses on studies examining the improvement of pain and function when completing a loading program for mid-portion AT. Only randomised/ quasi-randomised trials will be included while case reports and case series will be excluded. The primary outcome assessing pain and function will be the Victorian Institute Sports Assessment - Achilles (VISA-A). Two reviewers will screen articles, extract data and assess the risk of bias independently with a third reviewer resolving any disagreements between the two reviewers. A meta-analysis will then be performed on the data (if appropriate) to determine if the traditional heavy load calf training protocol described by Alfredson is superior to wait-and-see, sham intervention, traditional physiotherapy, and other forms of exercise rehabilitation. DISCUSSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis will allow us to investigate if there are difference in pain and function when comparing wait-and-see, sham interventions, traditional physiotherapy and different exercise interventions to the traditional heavy eccentric calf training protocol for mid-portion Achilles tendon pain.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of heavy eccentric calf training (HECT) in comparison with natural history, traditional physiotherapy, sham interventions or other exercise interventions for improvements in pain and function in mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted as per the PRISMA guidelines. DATA SOURCES: PUBMED, CINAHL (Ovid) and CINAHL (EBSCO) were searched from inception until 24 September 2018. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing HECT to natural history, sham exercise, traditional physiotherapy and other exercise interventions were included. Primary outcome assessing pain and function was the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles. RESULTS: Seven studies met the inclusion criteria. This review suggests HECT may be superior to both natural history, mean difference (MD) (95\% CI) of 20.6 (11.7 to 29.5, one study) and traditional physiotherapy, MD (95\% CI) of 17.70 (3.75 to 31.66, two studies). Following removal of one study, at high risk of bias, due to pre-planned sensitivity analysis, this review suggests HECT may be inferior to other exercise interventions, MD (95\% CI) of -5.65 (-10.51 to -0.79, three studies). However, this difference is unlikely to be clinically significant. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that HECT may be superior to natural history and traditional physiotherapy while HECT may be inferior to other exercise interventions. However, due to methodological limitations, small sample size and a lack of data we are unable to be confident in the results of the estimate of the effect, as the true effect is likely to be substantially different.

	abstract = {Animal studies suggest that poor nutrition (e.g., high-fat, high-sugar diets) may lead to impairments in cognitive functioning. Accumulating evidence suggests that the deleterious effects of these diets appear more pronounced in animals maintained on this diet early in life, consistent with the notion that the developing brain may be especially vulnerable to environmental insults. The current paper provides the first systematic review of studies comparing the effects of high-fat, high-sugar diet exposure during adolescence and adulthood on memory performance. The majority of studies (7/8) identified here report diet-induced memory problems when diet exposure began in adolescence but not adulthood. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that adolescence is a sensitive period during which palatable diets may contribute to negative neurocognitive effects. The current review explores putative mechanisms involved in diet-induced cognitive dysfunction and highlights promising areas for further research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ticks are blood-sucking ectoparasites and transmit various types of protozoal, bacterial, and viral diseases in a wild as well as domestic animals and humans globally. Only a few  published reports are avaliable on the prevalence of tick-borne diseases in sheep and goats in Pakistan. AIM AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the prevalence (2000-2020) of tick-borne disease (theileriosis, babesiosis, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever infection, and anaplasmosis) in sheep and goats in Pakistan. METHODS: A systematic review of articles published in English language (since 2000-2020) was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar. Diagnostic methods used in the original reference articles were PCR, PCR-RLB, microscopy, and ELISA. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of theileriosis, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) infections was 15.40\%, 21.18\%, 26.78\%, and 11.62\%, respectively. The prevalence of anaplasmosis was 22.06\% (90/408) in sheep, 21.11\% (76/360) in goats, and 40\% (120/300) in both sheep and goats with substantial differences (P {\textless} 0.001). The prevalence of babesiosis among sheep was 29.88\% (104/348) with highly significant differences (P {\textless} 0.001), in goats was 29.88\% (25/60) with slightly significant differences (P {\textless} 0.031\%), and in both sheep and goats were 7\% (21/300) with highly significant differences (P {\textless} 0.001) according to subgroup analysis. The percentage of prevalence of theileriosis was 17.70\% (207/1169) in sheep with highly substantial differences (P {\textless} 0.001), 4.51\% (31/687) in goats with significant differences (P {\textless} 0.133), and 25\% (125/500) in both sheep and goats with a significant difference among them (P {\textless} 0.001). The prevalence of CCHF among sheep was 18.63\% (149/800) and 4.63\% (37/800) in goats, respectively. The widely used detection method was microscopy (45.56\%) followed by ELISA (38.38\%), PCR (12.56\%), and PCR-RLB (3.48\%) test, respectively. This is a comprehensive report on the status of tick-borne disease in sheep and goats in Pakistan. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, among tick-borne diseases anaplasmosis had the highest prevalence rate in sheep and goats. Due to its high prevalence, control measures should be taken to diagnose and prevent it.},

	abstract = {AIM: This was a systematic review conducted to evaluate the analgesic drugs and techniques used in the management of pain in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Systematic searches in PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect were conducted for peer-reviewed articles written in English and published from 1995 to 2015. The key search words were dogs, ovariohysterectomy, pain, and analgesics. This was followed by a manual search of the references within the primary data sources. Inclusion and exclusion of studies and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers. All randomized studies evaluating the effects of analgesics during ovariohysterectomy in dogs were included. RESULTS: A total of 31 trials met the criteria and were, therefore, included in the study. Data on the type of analgesic drugs used, the technique of administration, and the need for rescue analgesia were extracted from the papers. Individual analgesic protocols were used in 83.9\% of the studies compared to multimodal drug therapy, which was used in 16.1\% of the studies. Opioids were used in 39.0\% of studies, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in 19.4\%, a combination of NSAIDs and opioids in 19.4\%, local analgesics in 6.5\%, and acupuncture in 3.2\% of the studies. Drug administration was done using three approaches that included pre-operative (64.5\%), post-operative (22.6\%) as well as combined pre- and post-operative approach (12.9\%). In 77.4\% of the studies, administration of analgesics was done once, while in 12.9\%, it was done as a 72-h post-operative course. 24-h and 48-h courses of post-operative pain therapy were done in 6.5\% and 3.2\% of the studies, respectively. About 57\% of the dogs in the control groups required rescue analgesia as compared to 21.6\% in the single and 11.3\% in multimodal drug therapy groups. The requirement for rescue analgesics was highest in dogs treated using acupuncture (43.8\%) and lowest in dogs treated using NSAID-opioid combination (8.6\%). Fewer dogs among those that received pain medication preoperatively and postoperatively required rescue analgesia compared to those in groups given drugs before and after surgery only. More dogs (26.4\%) among those given analgesics only once postoperatively required rescue analgesia as compared to those that received analgesics daily for 72 h (4.4\%). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that opioids are the mainstream analgesic drugs used in managing acute post-operative pain in dogs' post-ovariohysterectomy. In addition, multimodal drug therapy, particularly, NSAID-opioids combination is more effective for pain management than single drug administration. Administering analgesics both before and after surgery is associated with better outcomes and so is a protracted course of post-operative pain therapy. Although these practices should be encouraged, controlled studies should be conducted to conclusively determine the best practices for pain management in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy.},

	abstract = {This systematic review describes what "the cutting edge vaccines for Aeromonas hydrophila are". The focus is on types of high tech biotechnological based vaccines, target gene or antigen in developing these vaccines, and challenge model fish species used in vaccines efficacy testing. Vaccines delivery methods, immune response, and their efficacy, adjuvant or carrier systems used, and the overall experimental setup or design of the vaccines under investigation are also described. The search for the original papers published between 2009 and 2018 was conducted in June of 2018, using the PubMed and Google scholar electronic database. Twenty-three (23/4386) studies were included in the final assembly using PRISMA guidelines (Protocol not registered). Recombinant protein vaccines were the highly experimented type of the modern biotechnological based vaccines identified in the selected studies (16/23; 70\%). Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of different β-barrels were shown to be a potential antigenic entity for A. hydrophila vaccines (57\%). Intraperitoneal route with conventional carries or adjuvants was the highly applied delivery system while very few studies used herbal based vaccine adjuvants and nanomaterial as a vaccine carrier. Variation was observed in terms of protection levels in the selected studies. The experimental designs partly contributed to the observed variation. Therefore, recombinant vaccines that use new carrier system technologies and delivered through oral route in feeds would have been of great value for use in the prevention and control of A. hydrophila infections in fish. Despite the usefulness as academic tools to identify what is important in pathogenicity of the etiological agent to the host fish, these vaccines are only economically viable in very high-value animals. Therefore, if vaccination is a good option for A. hydrophila group, then simple autogenous vaccines based on accurate typing and evidence-based definition of the epidemiological unit for their use would be the most viable approach in terms of both efficacy and economic feasibility especially in low and middle-income countries (LMIC).},

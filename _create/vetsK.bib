	abstract = {The objectives of this review were to summarize the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of animal-assisted therapy (AAT). Studies were eligible if they were RCTs. Studies included one treatment group in which AAT was applied. We searched the following databases from 1990 up to October 31, 2012: MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Ichushi Web, GHL, WPRIM, and PsycINFO. We also searched all Cochrane Database up to October 31, 2012. Eleven RCTs were identified, and seven studies were about "Mental and behavioral disorders". Types of animal intervention were dog, cat, dolphin, bird, cow, rabbit, ferret, and guinea pig. The RCTs conducted have been of relatively low quality. We could not perform meta-analysis because of heterogeneity. In a study environment limited to the people who like animals, AAT may be an effective treatment for mental and behavioral disorders such as depression, schizophrenia, and alcohol/drug addictions, and is based on a holistic approach through interaction with animals in nature. To most effectively assess the potential benefits for AAT, it will be important for further research to utilize and describe (1) RCT methodology when appropriate, (2) reasons for non-participation, (3) intervention dose, (4) adverse effects and withdrawals, and (5) cost.},

	abstract = {The hypo-osmotic swelling test (HOS test) is a simple and inexpensive test to evaluate the functional integrity of sperm cell membranes. According to the existing literature, its simple applicability has turned it into a valuable additional parameter to standard canine semen analysis. In the recent years, much research has been conducted in this field. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the quality of published literature in canine reproduction concerning the HOS test. Using two distinguished databases, 38 articles were detected and analysed subsequently according to various aspects, for example study design, population, semen sampling and implementation concerning the HOS test. Although there are numerous articles available, the diagnostic value of the HOS test remains ambiguous. Until now, neither a recognized test protocol nor reliable reference values have been defined. Most of the trials evaluated show serious methodological flaws and therefore do not permit drawing reliable conclusions. According to our results, approximately half of the studies (n = 20) included a sample size of five or less animals. None of the studies examined the inter- or intraobserver agreement for the HOS test. Further research is warranted including appropriate statistical methods and a sufficient number of animals to establish a standardized test protocol as well as reliable reference values. Most importantly, it is required to clarify a correlation between the HOS test and the fertilizing capacity to determine the diagnostic value of the HOS test.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The existing Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination provides partial protection against tuberculosis (TB). The modified vaccinia ankara virus-expressing antigen 85A (MVA85A) aims to boost BCG immunity. We evaluated the animal evidence supporting the testing of MVA85A in humans. METHODS: Our protocol included in vivo preclinical studies of the MVA85A booster with BCG compared with BCG alone, followed by a TB challenge. We used standard methods for systematic review of animal studies, and summarized mortality, measures of pathology and lung bacterial load. The comprehensive literature search was to September 2014. Two independent investigators assessed eligibility and performed data extraction. We assessed study quality and pooled bacteria load using random effect meta-analysis. FINDINGS: We included eight studies in 192 animals. Three experiments were in mice, two in guinea pigs, two in macaques and one in calves. Overall, study quality was low with no randomization, baseline comparability not described and blinding not reported. For animal death (including euthanasia due to severe morbidity), studies were underpowered, and overall no benefit demonstrated. No difference was shown for lung pathology measured on an ordinal scale or bacterial load. The largest mortality trial carried out in macaques had more deaths in the MVA85A vaccine group, and was published after a trial in South Africa had started recruiting children. CONCLUSIONS: This independent assessment of the animal data does not provide evidence to support efficacy of MVA85A as a BCG booster. More rigorous conduct and reporting of preclinical research are warranted, and we believe the results of studies should be publicly available before embarking on trials in humans, irrespective of the findings.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the use and adverse effects of alpha(2)-agonists in sheep. STUDY DESIGN: Literature review. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 'Pubmed' of the United States National Library of Medicine and 'Veterinary Science' of CAB International were searched for references relating sheep to alpha(2)-agonists. The bibliographies of retrieved articles were further scrutinized for pertinent references, and relevant articles were selected manually. RESULTS: Reports on the use of clonidine, xylazine, detomidine, romifidine, medetomidine and dexmedetomidine, MPV-2426 and ST-91 in sheep were found in the literature. Most of the studies described xylazine followed by medetomidine and clonidine. The literature on detomidine and romifidine in sheep was sparse. Reports included pharmacokinetic studies, evaluation of sedative, analgesic, and anaesthetic techniques with or without cardiovascular effects, and experimental investigations of adverse effects (mainly hypoxaemia) including the mechanisms of pulmonary oedema and impaired oxygenation after alpha(2)-agonist administration. CONCLUSIONS: A(2)-agonists are potent and effective analgesics in sheep. In combination with ketamine, they are frequently used for the induction and maintenance of anaesthesia, in this case analgesia is satisfactory. The degree of hypoxaemia which occurs with all commercially available alpha(2)-agonists is highly variable and depends on individual or breed-related factors; the most severe reactions occur after intravenous (IV) injection and during general anaesthesia. Clinical relevance Subclinical respiratory disease is common in sheep. Rapid IV injection of alpha(2)-agonists without supplementary oxygen should be avoided whenever hypoxaemia may be critical.},

However, the volume and diversity of influenza research is low, especially in light of the burden of influenza in the region.

DATA SOURCES: Electronic search of MEDLINE database. HUMAN DATA SYNTHESIS: Sepsis-induced AKI is diagnosed in up to 47\% of human ICU patients and is seen as a major public health concern associated with increased mortality and increased progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Consensus criteria for the definition and classification of AKI has allowed for accurate description of the epidemiology of patients with AKI. AKI develops from a complex relationship between the initial insult and activation of inflammation and coagulation. In contrast to the traditional view, clinical and experimental data dispute the role of renal ischemia-reperfusion in the development of sepsis-induced AKI. Renal tubular dysfunction with activation of the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism appears to be a crucial contributor to sepsis-induced AKI. Furosemide and n-acetylcysteine (NAC) do not appear to be helpful in the treatment of AKI. Hydroxyethyl starches (HES), dopamine, and supraphysiological concentrations of chloride are harmful in patients with AKI. VETERINARY DATA SYNTHESIS: Community and hospital-acquired AKI is a significant factor affecting survival in critical ill patients. Sepsis-induced AKI occurs in 12\% of dogs with abdominal sepsis and is an important contributor to mortality. Early detection of AKI in hospitalized patients currently offers the best opportunity to improve patient outcome. The use of urinary biomarkers to diagnose early AKI should be evaluated in critical care patients. CONCLUSION: Veterinary clinical trials comparing treatment choices with the development of AKI are needed to make evidence-based recommendations for the prevention and treatment of AKI.},

Relevance screening identified 201 relevant studies that were subjected to methodological assessment. Of these studies, 159 were suitable for data extraction, 66 were presented in a number of MAs and 130 were examined in a meta-regression (MR). Fourteen different CE products were identified, 9 of them commercial products, and the most common route of administration was oral gavage (63.7\% of trials). Meta-analyses indicated that a number of CE products reduce Salmonella colonization in broilers, the most effective one being Preempt which was formerly known as CF-3. Five study characteristics (publication year, CE type, CE route, sample origin, and Salmonella serovar administered/recovered) and three methodological soundness characteristics (treatment assignment, intervention and laboratory methods description) were retained as statistically significant (p{\textless}0.05) in the final MR model. The MR analysis indicated that, undefined CE products outperformed all commercial products, except for: Preempt and Broilact((R)). Both were considered comparable to the undefined chicken source CE culture products in effectiveness. The administration of CE through spraying the chicks at the hatchery was determined to be just as effective as the oral gavage treatment, and more practical for farmers to administer. The results of this study could be useful in decision-making concerning the on-farm use of CE products in broiler chickens, and as inputs for risk assessments as the industry pushes for more antibiotic-free alternatives. Out of the various interventions to reduce Salmonella colonization in broilers on-farm, CE was the most studied; its inability to be licenced in certain countries and proof of consistent efficacy remains a barrier.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted using the results of 82 experiments (78 publications, 266 treatments) to investigate the importance of dietary C18 fatty acids (FA) and feeding regimen for milk C18 FA profile and apparent recovery of selected FA relative to intake of these FA or their precursors. Feeding treatments based on lipid-supplemented diets were excluded. Feeding regimens were defined as grazing [including partial and full-time grazing, at dietary concentrate proportions from 0 to 44\% dry matter (DM)], forage-based indoor feeding [{\textgreater}65\% forage of total DM intake (DMI)], and concentrate-based indoor feeding (forage DMI {\textless}/=65\% of DMI). Linoleic acid (LLA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), and total C18 FA proportions in milk fat increased linearly with the respective dietary FA content in all feeding regimens tested. This effect was highest in the forage-based indoor feeding. Slopes were lowest for the grazing regimens, especially regarding ALA and the sum of all C18 FA, whereas the intercepts of the prediction equations of milk ALA and total C18 FA proportions were highest for grazing regimens. This indicates that, in grazing cows, factors other than dietary FA contents determine the C18 FA composition of the milk fat. At equal dietary LLA contents, the type of feeding regimen showed no significant effect on LLA proportion in milk fat. Milk fat proportions of rumenic acid and vaccenic acid were positively related to the sum of dietary ALA and LLA contents. Grazing regimens led to the strongest enrichment of rumenic acid and vaccenic acid in milk fat. The apparent recovery of ALA, LLA, and total C18 FA (secreted, \% of intake), an estimate for transfer efficiency, decreased with increasing dietary content. This relationship followed a nonlinear decay function. When the dietary content of these FA exceeded a certain threshold (about 0.2, 0.8, and 2.8\% of DM for ALA, LLA, and total C18 FA, respectively) the recovery in milk remained constant at about 5, 10, and 82\% of the ingested ALA, LLA, and total C18 FA, respectively. At dietary proportions below 0.01\% ALA and 1.5\% total C18 FA of DM, their apparent recovery in milk fat exceeded 100\%. In conclusion, a general inverse relationship between dietary C18 FA and the corresponding apparent recovery in milk fat seems to exist. Within this frame, the effect of different types of feeding regimens on the eventual milk C18 FA profile varies. Among them, grazing pasture appears to provide the most variable properties.},

	abstract = {The present study aimed at investigating the effects of essential oils and their bioactive compounds (EOBC) on rumen fermentation in vivo as well as animal performance and feed efficiency in different ruminant species, using a meta-analysis approach. Ruminant species were classified into 3 classes consisting of beef cattle, dairy cattle, and small ruminants. Two datasets (i.e., rumen fermentation and animal performance) were constructed, according to the available dependent variables within each animal class, from 28 publications (34 experiments) comprising a total of 97 dietary treatments. In addition, changes in rumen fermentation parameters relative to controls (i.e., no EOBC supplementation) of all animal classes were computed. Data were statistically analyzed within each animal class to evaluate the EOBC dose effect, taking into account variations of other variables across experiments (e.g., diet, feeding duration). The dose effect of EOBC on relative changes in fermentation parameters were analyzed across all animal classes. The primary results were that EOBC at doses {\textless}0.75 g/kg diet DM acted as a potential methane inhibitor in the rumen as a result of decreased acetate to propionate ratio. These responses were more pronounced in beef cattle (methane, P = 0.001; acetate to propionate ratio, P = 0.005) than in small ruminants (methane, P = 0.068; acetate to propionate ratio, P = 0.056) and in dairy cattle (P {\textgreater} 0.05), respectively. The analysis of relative changes in rumen fermentation variables suggests that EOBC affected protozoa numbers (P {\textless} 0.001) but only high doses ({\textgreater}0.20 g/kg DM) of EOBC had an inhibitory effect on this variable whereas lower doses promoted the number. For performance data, because numbers of observations in beef cattle and small ruminants were small, only those of dairy cattle (DMI, milk yield and milk composition, and feed efficiency) were analyzed. The results revealed no effect of EOBC dose on most parameters, except increased milk protein percentage (P{\textless} 0.001) and content (P = 0.006). It appears that EOBC supplementation can enhance rumen fermentation in such a way (i.e., decreased acetate to propionate ratio) that may favor beef production. High doses of EOBC do not necessarily modify rumen fermentation or improve animal performance and feed efficiency. Furthermore, additional attention should be paid to diet composition and supplementation period when evaluating the effects of EOBC in ruminants.},

The rat was compared to other laboratory animals to assess differences in the duration of bone growth and its relationship to age at sexual maturity and lifespan. We reviewed the literature from 1966 to March 1999 by searching MEDLINE and other databases. Growth closure times and age at sexual maturity were retrieved for the mouse, rabbit, dog, cat, sheep, cow, horse, nonhuman primates, and human. For all species, we calculated the ratios of: 1) age at growth plate closure to lifespan, 2) age at growth plate closure to age at sexual maturity, and 3) age at sexual maturity to average lifespan. The ratio of age at physis closure to the average lifespan was large for the rat (22 to 35) and showed some overlap with that of humans (17 to 25); this ratio was comparatively small in all other nonhuman species (range, 4 to 17). This finding indicates that bone growth continues in the rat for a greater proportion of their lifespan than does that in other species. The ratio of age at physis closure to age at sexual maturity was larger for the rat (5 to 6) than that for other species, indicating that bone growth continues much longer after sexual maturity in rats than in other animals. The ratio of age at sexual maturity to average lifespan was largest for humans and nonhuman primates (13 to 14), indicating the increased time to reach puberty versus that in other species. These differences are important for studies in which animal models are used in research involving bone growth.},

Using a literature search of MEDLINE/PubMed databases, studies were limited to those that utilized full-thickness wounds and compared the wound-healing parameters of wound closure, re-epithelialization, granulation tissue fill, and tensile strength between young and aged cohorts. Overall, wound closure, re-epithelialization, and granulation tissue fill were delayed or decreased with aging across different strains of mice and rats. Aging in mice was associated with lower tensile strength early in the wound healing process, but greater tensile strength later in the wound healing process. Similarly, aging in rats was associated with lower tensile strength early in the wound healing process, but no significant tensile strength difference between young and old rats later in healing wounds. From studies in New Zealand White rabbits, we found that re-epithelialization and granulation tissue fill were delayed or decreased overall with aging. While similarities and differences in key wound healing parameters were noted between different strains and species, the comparability across the studies was highly questionable, highlighted by wide variability in experimental design and reporting. In future studies, standardized experimental design and reporting would help to establish comparable study groups, and advance the overall knowledge base, facilitating the translatability of animal data to the human clinical condition.

A database of articles addressing the experimental infection with Coccidia in broilers was developed. These publications must present results of animal performance (weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio). The database was composed by 69 publications, totalling around 44 thousand animals. Meta-analysis followed three sequential analyses: graphical, correlation, and variance-covariance. The feed intake of the groups challenged by E. acervulina and E. tenella did not differ (P{\textgreater}0.05) to the control group. However, the feed intake in groups challenged by E. maxima and Pool showed an increase of 8\% and 5\% (P{\textless}0.05) in relation to the control group. Challenged groups presented a decrease (P{\textless}0.05) in weight gain compared with control groups. All challenged groups showed a reduction in weight gain, even when there was no reduction (P{\textless}0.05) in feed intake (adjustment through variance-covariance analysis). The feed intake variation in broilers infected with E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. tenella, or Pool showed a quadratic (P{\textless}0.05) influence over the variation in weight gain. In relation to the isolated effects, the challenges have an impact of less than 1\% over the variance in feed intake and weight gain. However, the magnitude of the effects varied with Eimeria species, animal age, sex, and genetic line. In general the age effect is superior to the challenge effect, showing that age at the challenge is important to determine the impact of Eimeria infection.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the evidence available for nonsurgical management of hip dysplasia (HD). STUDY DESIGN: Literature review. METHODS: Databases (Pubmed, Veterinary Information Network) were searched for clinical studies on nonsurgical management of HD in dogs. The evidence in each study was reviewed and assigned a score (I-IV) based on previously reported levels of evidence. RESULTS: Fourteen articles were identified that met the inclusion criteria, including 3 Level IV, 4 Level III, and 7 Level II studies. Methods of nonsurgical management reviewed included: activity restrictions, weight management, acupuncture, modulation of joint disease by polysulfated glycosaminoglycans, mesenchymal stem cell therapy, and extra corporeal shock wave therapy. CONCLUSION: Weight management is an effective and important component of managing dogs with HD and associated osteoarthritis. Techniques that modulate the progression of joint disease may also be beneficial for treating dogs with HD. Further studies are needed to investigate other methods of managing HD such as hydrotherapy and physical rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {This study examined the role of supplementation of several bioactive compounds (BC) and the chemical composition of the diet used as substrate for in vitro incubations, on in vitro ruminal fermentation profile and nutrient degradation. A meta-analytical approach was used to weigh the sample size used in each experiment, and account for the random effect of each as well as unequal variance among studies. A total of 20 recently conducted experiments with 354 treatments, each including one control (i.e., no BC supplementation), fulfilled the criteria for inclusion. Doses of BC supplementation varied from 0.03 to 500 mg/g dry matter (DM) of incubated diet. Contents of crude protein (CP) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) of the incubated diets (DM basis) ranged from 139 to 189 g/kg and 160 to 420 g/kg, respectively. Results indicate that supplementation of BC linearly decreased (137.4 versus 116.5 mmol/L; P{\textless}0.05) concentration of total volatile fatty acids (VFA) and proportion of acetate (P{\textless}0.05). Also, the concentration of ammonia in the in vitro rumen fluid was lower with BC supplementation (22.9 versus 15.6 mg/dL; P{\textless}0.05). Analysis by backward elimination correlation analysis revealed that inclusion of the chemical composition of the incubated diet into the model with BC supplementation improved the accuracy of estimation of responses of fermentation variables. Thus, higher NDF and CP contents of the substrate and higher BC dosage were associated with lower concentrations of total VFA (r²=0.54), whereas both lower CP contents of the substrate and BC supplementation lowered the concentration of ammonia (r²=0.32). This analysis showed negative associations between BC supplementation and in vitro disappearance of DM and NDF, and positive correlations with dietary NDF content. In contrast, higher BC inclusion and lowering NDF content in the diet was accompanied with decreased in vitro CH₄ formation (r²=0.21). Results indicate that BC supplementation and chemical composition of the incubated diet are determining factors which impact responses of in vitro ruminal fermentation and degradation.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis investigation based on literature data was conducted to estimate the effect size of nutritional and animal factors on phosphorus (P) excretion in feces and concentrations of P in milk. Two data sets were created for statistical analysis: One to derive prediction equations for P in feces (25 studies; 130 treatments) and another for P in milk (19 studies; 94 treatments). Prediction equations were derived using mixed model regression analysis with a random effect for study, and equations were evaluated based on values for Bayesian information criterion (BIC), root mean square prediction error (RMSPE), and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) statistics. In terms of RMSPE and CCC values, fecal P excretion was best predicted by P intake, where P in feces (g/d) = -3.8(+/-3.45) + 0.64(+/-0.038) x P intake (g/d) (RMSPE: 18.3\%, CCC: 0.869). However, significant effects of crude protein [g/kg of dry matter (DM)], neutral detergent fiber (g/kg of DM), and milk yield (kg/d) on fecal P excretion were also found. Despite a lack of improvement in terms of RMSPE and CCC values, these parameters may still explain part of the variation in fecal P excretion. For milk P, expressed as a fraction of P intake, the following equation had the highest CCC and the lowest RMSPE value: P in milk as a fraction of P intake (g/g) = 0.42(+/-0.065) + 0.23(+/-0.018) x feed efficiency (i.e., fat- and protein-corrected milk yield/dry matter intake) – 0.11(+/-0.0199) x P in feed (g/kg of DM) (RMSPE: 19.7\%; CCC: 0.761). Equations derived to predict fecal P as a fraction of P intake (g/g) or milk P content (g/kg) could not adequately explain the observed variation and did not perform well in terms of RMSPE and CCC values. Examination of the residuals showed that P balance was a seemingly confounding factor in some of the models. The results presented here can be used to estimate P in feces and milk based on commonly measured dietary and milk variables, but could also be used to guide development of mechanistic models on P metabolism in lactating dairy cattle. Factors to consider in future research and modeling efforts regarding efficiency of P use include the effects of dietary neutral detergent fiber, crude protein, starch, variation in P content of milk, and effects of P resorption from bone and body tissues during early lactation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Histopathology has initially been and is still used to diagnose infectious, degenerative or neoplastic diseases in humans or animals. In addition to qualitative diagnoses semiquantitative scoring of a lesion`s magnitude on an ordinal scale is a commonly demanded task for histopathologists. Multiparametric, semiquantitative scoring systems for mouse models histopathology are a common approach to handle these questions and to include histopathologic information in biomedical research. RESULTS: Inclusion criteria for scoring systems were a first description of a multiparametric, semiquantiative scoring systems which comprehensibly describe an approach to evaluate morphologic lesion. A comprehensive literature search using these criteria identified 153 originally designed semiquantitative scoring systems for the analysis of morphologic changes in mouse models covering almost all organs systems and a wide variety of disease models. Of these, colitis, experimental autoimmune encephalitis, lupus nephritis and collagen induced osteoarthritis colitis were the disease models with the largest number of different scoring systems. Closer analysis of the identified scoring systems revealed a lack of a rationale for the selection of the scoring parameters or a correlation between scoring parameter value and the magnitude of the clinical symptoms in most studies. CONCLUSION: Although a decision for a particular scoring system is clearly dependent on the respective scientific question this review gives an overview on currently available systems and may therefore allow for a better choice for the respective project.},

	abstract = {Clinicians and pathologists are sporadically asked by owners whether the taking of tumour biopsies may affect the behaviour of the tumour, including its potential to metastasise. Unfortunately, systematic studies on this subject are unavailable in veterinary medicine, and the aim of this study was to estimate the risk of adverse effects of biopsy taking on tumour progression in animals. A systematic review of veterinary and human case reports and clinical studies as well as experimental animal models of biopsy-induced tumour metastasis was undertaken. There were only two veterinary case reports of needle tract metastases (NTM) following the taking of needle biopsies from urogenital and pulmonary tumours. Seventeen experimental studies found a high incidence of NTM but only a rat osteosarcoma and a hamster squamous carcinoma model showed an increased incidence of distant or regional metastases after incision or excision biopsy. In human medicine, the occurrence of NTM has been reported after the taking of biopsies from mesotheliomas (15\%), melanomas (11\%) and gall bladder tumours (11\%), liver metastases of colon carcinomas (4\%) and mammary carcinomas (4\%) but an incidence of only {\textless}1\% for all other tumours. Circulating tumour cells increased immediately after the taking of biopsies from human squamous cell, prostate, breast and hepatocellular carcinomas. Although no increased risk of biopsy-induced distant metastasis has been reported for any type of tumour, this is inconclusive due to a lack of non-biopsied control groups in human studies. Reports of biopsy-induced metastasis in animal tumours indicate that the taking of transcutaneous biopsies from urogenital tumours may be associated with a risk of NTM. However, there is no evidence of a general increase in risk of distant metastases in any tumour type in people or animals. The overall risk therefore appears to be negligible when compared to the valuable information obtained from biopsies in veterinary practice.},

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of publications on E. coli as calf pathogens and the role of calves as reservoir have not been done so far. We reviewed studies between 1951 and 2013 reporting the presence of virulence associated factors (VAFs) in calf E. coli and extracted the following information: year(s) and country of sampling, animal number, health status, isolate number, VAF prevalence, serotypes, diagnostic methods, and biological assays. The prevalence of VAFs or E. coli pathotypes was compared between healthy and diarrheic animals and was analyzed for time courses. Together, 106 papers with 25,982 E. coli isolates from 27 countries tested for VAFs were included. F5, F17, and F41 fimbriae and heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) – VAFs of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) were significantly associated with calf diarrhea. On the contrary, ETEC VAF F4 fimbriae and heat-labile enterotoxin as well as enteropathogenic (EPEC), Shiga toxin-producing (STEC), and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) were not associated with diarrhea. The prevalence increased overtime for ST-positive isolates, but decreased for F5- and STEC-positive isolates. Our study provides useful information about the history of scientific investigations performed in this domain so far, and helps to define etiological agents of calf disease, and to evaluate calves as reservoir hosts for human pathogenic E. coli.},

	abstract = {The thermotolerant species of Campylobacter have become very important in public health, particularly as agents of infectious diarrhoea in human beings. Though the mechanism by which they cause disease is yet to be fully explained, they have been recognized as the leading cause of bacterial enteritis in both developed and developing countries. The organisms colonize different animal species without causing any symptoms of disease; and humans acquire infections through contact with or consumption of contaminated meat especially raw/undercooked poultry meat. The growing trend of antibiotic resistant Campylobacter isolates continues to pose significant public health challenges. In this review we present the available information generated in Tanzania about Campylobacter infections in humans and animals. We conducted a structured literature search of PUBMED and ScienceDirect electronic databases and identified 15 articles. Studies on humans reported Campylobacter infections in both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects; with higher prevalence in children under the age of five years. Studies on animals found colonization of both domestic and wild species. Among isolates, some demonstrated antimicrobial resistance. The available information for both human and animal Campylobacteriosis in the country is sparse. It however provides an insight of the bacteriological and epidemiological aspects of Campylobacter infections in the country and eventually creates more awareness on the need to develop control strategies. Since the organism is zoonotic its control strategies should adopt the "One Health" approach involving collaborative efforts from veterinary and human medicine.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Results from animal toxicology studies are critical to evaluating potential harm from exposure to environmental chemicals or safety of drugs prior to human testing. However, there is significant debate about how to evaluate the methodology and potential biases of the animal studies. There is no agreed upon approach, and a systematic evaluation of current best practices is lacking. OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review to identify and evaluate instruments for assessing risk of bias and/or other methodological criteria of animal studies. METHOD: We searched Medline (January 1966 – November 2011) to identify all relevant articles. We extracted data on risk of bias criteria (e.g. randomization, blinding, allocation concealment) and other study design features included in each assessment instrument. DISCUSSION: Thirty distinct instruments were identified with the total number of assessed risk of bias, methodological, and/or reporting criteria ranging from 2 to 25. The most common criteria assessed were randomization (25/30, 83\%), investigator blinding (23/30, 77\%) and sample size calculation (18/30, 60\%). In general, authors failed to empirically justify why these or other criteria were included. Nearly all (28/30, 93\%) instruments have not been rigorously tested for validity or reliability. CONCLUSION: Our review highlights a number of risk of bias assessment criteria that have been empirically tested for animal research including randomization, concealment of allocation, blinding and accounting for all animals. Additionally, there is a need for empirically testing additional methodological criteria, and assessing the validity and reliability of a standard risk of bias assessment instrument.},

	abstract = {The aim of this investigation was, through a meta-analysis, to review the published literature concerning the effect of PCV2 vaccination on the average daily weight gain (ADG) and on the mortality rate in pigs from weaning to slaughter. The review was restricted to studies investigating the effect of vaccines against PCV2 published from 2006 to 2008, identified using computerised literature databases. Only studies that met the following criteria were included: commercial vaccines were used, pigs or pens were assigned randomly to vaccination versus control groups in herds naturally infected with PCV2, and vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs were housed together. Furthermore, it was a requirement that sample size, age at vaccination, and production period were stated. The levels of ADG and mortality rate had to be comparable to those seen in modern intensive swine production. In total, 107 studies were identified; 70 were excluded because they did not fulfil the inclusion criteria and 13 were identical to results published elsewhere. A significant effect of PCV2 vaccination on ADG was found for pigs in all production phases. The largest increase in ADG was found for finishing pigs (41.5g) and nursery-finishing pigs (33.6g) with only 10.6g increase in the nursery pigs. Mortality rate was significantly reduced for finishing pigs (4.4\%) and nursery-finishing pigs (5.4\%), but not for nursery pigs (0.25\%). Herds negative for PRRS had a significantly larger increase in ADG compared to herds positive for PRRS. The PRRS status had no effect on mortality rate.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is a serious public health burden in sub-Saharan Africa. Praziquantel is the only drug recommended by the World Health Organization to treat both urogenital and intestinal schistosomiasis. The reliance on a single drug to treat a disease with such a huge burden has raised concerns of possible drug resistance mainly in endemic areas. This systematic review was conducted to identify gaps and recent progress on the efficacy of different regimens of praziquantel in treating schistosomiasis among children in sub-Saharan Africa where Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium are endemic. MAIN TEXT: A literature search of peer-reviewed journals was done on Google Scholar, MEDLINE (under EBSCOhost) and PubMed databases using pre-defined search terms and Boolean operators. The search included studies published from 2008 to 2017 (August) with emphasis on the efficacy of praziquantel on S. haematobium and S. mansoni infections among preschool and school children. Nineteen publications satisfied the inclusion criteria for the review. The studies reviewed were from 10 sub-Saharan African countries and 7/19 of the studies (37\%) were conducted in Uganda. Seven studies (37\%) focused on Schistosoma mansoni, 6/19 (31.5\%) on S. haematobium and another 6 on mixed infection. A single standard dose of 40 mg/kg body weight was the most used regimen (9) followed by the repeated single standard dose assessed for efficacy at 3-4 weeks post-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A repeated standard dose of 40 mg/kg achieved satisfactory efficacy compared to a single dose against both parasite species. However, findings on efficacy of repeated doses in co-infection of S. mansoni and S. haematobium were not conclusive. Praziquantel administrated at 60 mg/kg was slightly more efficacious than the 40 mg/kg standard dose. Minor and transitory side-effects were reported for both regimens. The review indicates that further investigations are necessary to conclusively determine efficacy of praziquantel on coinfection of S. haematobium and S. mansoni to formulate concrete guidelines on the use of repeated doses at 40 or 60 mg/kg for treating schistosomiasis. We recommend the use of the egg reduction rate (ERR) formula recommended by the WHO for assessing praziquantel efficacy in order for the results to be comparable for different regions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Using analgesics for a short period to relieve the pain following specific orthodontic procedures is common. Such medications may influence orthodontic tooth movement biochemical pathways; however, the information originating from human studies is limited. OBJECTIVES: To systematically investigate current evidence from animal experiments on the effect of administering analgesics for a few days, which is consistent with usual clinical practice, on the speed of orthodontic tooth movement. SEARCH METHODS: Eight databases were searched without restrictions, and hand searching was conducted until June 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Animal controlled studies assessing the short-term impact of analgesics that can be consumed for orthodontic pain on the speed of orthodontic tooth movement. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Subsequent to retrieving relevant studies and information extraction, the SYRCLE's Risk of Bias Tool was used for risk of bias assessment. RESULTS: Finally, seven studies were selected, and most of them were assessed at unclear risk of bias. Short-term administration of acetaminophen did not affect significantly the speed of tooth movement, while ibuprofen and indomethacin were reported to decrease it. After administering acetylsalicylic acid and celecoxib, the noted effects were inconsistent. The quality of the available evidence for the animal setting was considered as moderate at most. CONCLUSIONS: Consuming specific analgesics for a few days may influence the speed of orthodontic tooth movement in animals. Clinicians should be aware of the relevant implications and be capable to identify those substances that may not interfere with treatment processes.},

	abstract = {Immediately after the removal of orthodontic appliances, the teeth might start to drift away from their corrected position in an attempt to reach a new equilibrium. Medications and biologic factors could potentially modulate these processes. The objective of the present systematic review is to systematically investigate and appraise the quality of the evidence regarding the effect of various medications and biologic factors on the rate of relapse following active tooth movement. Search without restrictions in eight databases and hand searching until April 2020 were conducted. Studies performed on animal models investigating the effects of medication and biologic factors on the rate of relapse following orthodontic tooth movement were considered. Following study retrieval and selection, relevant data were extracted and the risk of bias was assessed. Seventeen studies were finally identified, mostly at either high or unclear risk of bias. Ketorolac did not show any significant effects on relapse, while the administration of tetracycline, atorvastatin, psoralen and raloxifene decreased it. Overall, the same result was observed with bisphosphonates with the exception of low dosage of risedronate, which did not have an effect. Osteoprotegerin and strontium resulted in reduced relapse, but not in the immediate post-administration period. Inconsistent or conflicting effects were noted after the use of simvastatin and relaxin. The quality of the available evidence was considered at best as low. It can be concluded that specific medications and biologic factors may have an effect on the rate of relapse following tooth movement. The orthodontist should be knowledgeable about the substances potentially affecting retention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The speedy rate of change in the environmental and socio-economics factors may increase the incidence, prevalence and risk of schistosomiasis infections in Zambia. However, available information does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the biogeography and distribution of the disease, ecology and population dynamics of intermediate host snails. The current study used an information-theoretical approach to understand the biogeography and prevalence schistosomiasis and identified knowledge gaps that would be useful to improve policy towards surveillance and eradication of intermediate hosts snails in Zambia. METHODS: To summarise the existing knowledge and build on past and present experiences of schistosomiasis epidemiology for effective disease control in Zambia, a systematic search of literature for the period 2000-2017 was done on PubMed, Google Scholar and EBSCOhost. Using the key words: 'Schistosomiasis', 'Biomphalaria', 'Bulinus', 'Schistosoma mansoni', 'Schistosoma haematobium', and 'Zambia', in combination with Booleans terms 'AND' and 'OR', published reports/papers were obtained and reviewed independently for inclusion. RESULTS: Thirteen papers published in English that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were selected for the final review. The papers suggest that the risk of infection has increased over the years and this has been attributed to environmental, socio-economic and demographic factors. Furthermore, schistosomiasis is endemic in many parts of the country with infection due to Schistosoma haematobium being more prevalent than that due to S. mansoni. This review also found that S. haematobium was linked to genital lesions, thus increasing risks of contracting other diseases such as HIV and cervical cancer. CONCLUSIONS: For both S. haematobium and S. mansoni, environmental, socio-economic, and demographic factors were influential in the transmission and prevalence of the disease and highlight the need for detailed knowledge on ecological modelling and mapping the distribution of the disease and intermediate host snails for effective implementation of control strategies.},

	abstract = {In the recent past, sub-Saharan Africa has not escaped the devastating effects of avian influenza virus (AIV) in poultry and wild birds. This systematic review describes the prevalence, spatiotemporal distribution, and virus subtypes detected in domestic and wild birds for the past two decades (2000-2019). We collected data from three electronic databases, PubMed, SpringerLink electronic journals and African Journals Online, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol. A total of 1656 articles were reviewed, from which 68 were selected. An overall prevalence of 3.0\% AIV in birds was observed. The prevalence varied between regions and ranged from 1.1\% to 7.1\%. The Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test showed no significant difference in the prevalence of AIV across regions, χ(2)(3) = 5.237, p = 0.1553 and seasons, T = 820, z = -1.244, p = 0.2136. Nineteen hemagglutinin/neuraminidase subtype combinations were detected during the reviewed period, with southern Africa recording more diverse AIV subtypes than other regions. The most detected subtype was H5N1, followed by H9N2, H5N2, H5N8 and H6N2. Whilst these predominant subtypes were mostly detected in domestic poultry, H1N6, H3N6, H4N6, H4N8, H9N1 and H11N9 were exclusively detected in wild birds. Meanwhile, H5N1, H5N2 and H5N8 were detected in both wild and domestic birds suggesting circulation of these subtypes among wild and domestic birds. Our findings provide critical information on the eco-epidemiology of AIVs that can be used to improve surveillance strategies for the prevention and control of avian influenza in sub-Saharan Africa.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rodent models of liver resection have been used to investigate and evaluate the liver's complex physiology and pathology since 1931. First documented by Higgins and Anderson, such models were created to understand liver regeneration mechanisms to improve outcomes in patients undergoing extensive liver resection for liver cancer or other underlying liver diseases. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted using Pubmed, gathering publications up to January 2019, which engaged with the mouse model of extended liver resection as a method itself. The results of this search were filtered according to their language, novelty, and relevancy. RESULTS: The Boolean search found 3741 articles on Pubmed, with 3130 publications remaining when filtered by language and the presence of a full text. In total, 21 of these publications examined the key themes of the animal model described. The mortality varied from 0 to 50\% depending on the surgeon's experience and the resection method. The liver resection was mainly performed with classic sutures (14 out of 21 publications) and isoflurane was used for anaesthesia (10 out of 21 publications) in combination with analgesics (buprenorphine or ketamine/xylazine). The most used mouse strain was C57BL/6 (7 of 21 publications) which was on average 11 weeks old with a weight of 23 g. CONCLUSION: Through the overview, laid out in the selected publications, this paper reviews the shift of the extended liver resection model from rat to the mouse, describes the state of the art in the experimental setting, and discusses the possible limitations and pitfalls. Clearly, the extended liver resection in mice is a reproducible, practical and easy to learn method.},

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the data to see if this novel method is comparable to traditional laboratory screening and detection methods like Ziehl-Neelsen stain-based assays (ZN) and bacterial culture. The search and data processing strategy is registered at PROSPERO (CRD42019123629). Medline via PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched for the keywords "pouched rat" and "tuberculosis". Data from 53,181 samples obtained from 24,600 patients were extracted from seven studies. Using sample-wise detection, the sensitivity of the studies was 86.7\% [95\% CI 80.4-91.2\%], while the specificity was 88.4\% [95\% CI 79.7-93.7\%]. For patient-wise detection, the sensitivity was 81.3\% [95\% CI 64.0-91.4\%], while the specificity was 73.4\% [95\% CI 62.8-81.9\%]. Good and excellent classification was assessed by hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristic analysis for patient-wise and sample-wise detections, respectively. Our study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the above relatively inexpensive and rapid screening method. The results indicate that African giant pouched rats can discriminate healthy controls from TB individuals by sniffing sputum with even a higher accuracy than a single ZN screening.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Fluid resuscitation is the mainstay treatment to reconstitute intravascular volume and maintain end-organ perfusion in patients with severe burns. The use of a hyperosmotic or isoosmotic solution in fluid resuscitation to manage myocardial depression and increased capillary permeability during burn shock has been debated. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the efficacies of hyperosmotic and isoosmotic solutions in restoring hemodynamic stability after burn injuries. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov registry were searched. Randomized control trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of hyperosmotic and isoosmotic fluid resuscitation in patients with burn injuries were selected. Eligible trials were abstracted and assessed for the risk of bias by two reviewers and results of hemodynamic indicators in the included trials were analyzed. RESULTS: Ten trials including 502 participants were published between 1983 and 2013. Compared with isoosmotic group, the hyperosmotic group exhibited a significant decrease in the fluid load (vol/\% total body surface area [TBSA]/weight) at 24 hours postinjury, with a mean difference of -0.54 (95\% confidence interval = -0.92 to -0.17). No differences were observed in the urine output, creatinine level, and mortality at 24 hours postinjury between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperosmotic fluid resuscitation appears to be an attractive choice for severe burns in terms of TBSA or burn depth. Further investigation is recommended before conclusive recommendation.},

	abstract = {Natural waters containing originally hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas with an S2-level at least 1 mg/L are classified as "sulfur waters" or "hydrogen sulfide waters." This systematic review aimed to evaluate in vivo experimental studies investigating the biological effects of natural H2S water drinking in healthy or with disease model laboratory animals. A comprehensive databases search (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) was performed and PICOS criteria were used to assess eligibility. All relevant studies were identified, screened, and examined. The qualitative assessment was performed with the help of the SYRCLE Risk of Bias tool. A total of nine articles were included. The extracted data showed that ad libitum drinking of such waters by rats and mice exert beneficial effects on animal model of diabetes and glucose metabolism plus protective effects on diabetic cardiac, testicular, and nephrological complications as shown biochemically, histopathologically, and bio-molecularly. Additional effects were gastroprotection, antioxidant effects and improvement of intestinal physiology in healthy animals, reduction in general signs of murine model of colitis in mice, improvement in lipid metabolism and lipid-lowering effect, and positive interference with the enterohepatic cycle of the bile acids and biliary functions in hyperlipidemic rats. This systematic review provides preliminary insights into the "biological truth" about natural H2S waters and partly elucidates their potential therapeutic role in balneology and health resort medicine. However, it should be kept in mind that the retrieved preclinical data cannot be directly extrapolated to humans. Additionally, most of the included studies were rated for unclear risk of bias across all categories except random allocation, reflecting very poor reporting of methodological details. These limitations should be addressed when planning similar studies in the future. The question "can traditional hydropinic therapies or drinking cures with H2S waters at natural sulfur water spas/health resorts or natural (even artificial) H2S water consumption at home exert similar effects in humans?" remains to be clarified by clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Diabetes mellitus and pre-diabetes are prevalent endocrine disorders associated with substantial morbidity and premature mortality. Vitamin K is known to have several beneficial effects on complications of diabetes and pre-diabetes. However, systematic consolidation of evidence is required to quantify these effects in order to inform clinical practice and research. A systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, ProQuest, and Google Scholar databases was undertaken from database inception up to October 2018 to evaluate functional roles of different forms of vitamin K on diabetes and pre-diabetes. From 3, 734 identified records, nine articles met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated. Vitamin K supplementation was found to be associated with significant reductions in blood glucose (six studies), increased fasting serum insulin (four studies), reduced hemoglobin A1c (three studies), reduced homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) (two studies), and increased ss-cell function (two studies) in diabetic animal studies. Following 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test, vitamin K supplementation was observed to be effective in reducing blood glucose and insulin levels in the pre-diabetic population. However, no evidence of effect was observed for fasting blood sugar, insulin, HOMA-IR, and homeostatic model assessment-beta-cell function index (two studies). A statistically significant effect was also noted with vitamin K in improving dyslipidemia (three studies) as well as oxidative stress and inflammatory markers (five studies) in diabetic animals. In conclusion, clinical trials and animal studies confirm that vitamin K supplementation may improve both clinical features and complications of diabetes and pre-diabetes. However, quantification of clinical efficacy in the pre-diabetic population and among individuals with comorbidities requires further investigation.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Staphylococcus aureus, in particular its enterotoxigenic strains, is a well-known pathogen in food microbiology as one of the most common causes of food poisoning. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of S. aureus enterotoxigenic strains in Iranian food resources by using a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic search was performed using electronic databases from papers that were published by Iranian authors to the end of July 2017. Then, 34 publications which met our inclusion criteria were selected for data extraction and analysis. RESULTS: The average pooled prevalence of S. aureus in food resources was 15.5\% (95\% CI: 12.7\%-18.9\%) ranging from 1.1\% to 52\%. According to the examined publications the estimated average prevalence of enterotoxigenic strains was estimated at 53.7\% (95\% CI: 41.4\%-65.6\%) ranging from 13\% to 83.3\%. The average prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus in contaminated resources was estimated at 15.5\% (95\% CI: 11.1\%-21.4\%) ranging from 0\% to 32\%. The results showed that SEA and SEG were the most prevalent classic and new staphylococcal enterotoxins' (SEs) types. The results of antibiotic resistance pattern showed the highest resistance rates to β-lactams, tetracycline and erythromycin. CONCLUSIONS: The present analysis showed a significant presence of enterotoxigenic strains of S. aureus and a high rate of staphylococcal enterotoxins among food resources in Iran. However, also the prevalence of MRSA strains is remarkable and requires an improvement of the hygienic conditions to reduce the risk of MRSA dissemination in community and hospitals. Furthermore, the rational use of antibiotics in the environments related to food resources is recommended.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Among the genetic elements, integrons may contribute to the widespread incidence and spreading of antibiotic resistance among Escherichia coli isolates. Accordingly, this review aims to investigate the prevalence of class 1 integron in E. coli isolated from animal sources in Iran. METHODS: This systematic literature search was performed from January 1, 2000 to the end of May 1, 2019.Then, publications that met our inclusion criteria were selected for data extraction and analysis. Also, the quality of included studies was independently assessed by two researchers based on the Joanna Briggs Institute. Meta-analysis was performed by the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software using the random effects model, Cochran's Q, and I (2) tests. Publication bias was estimated by funnel plot and Egger's linear regression test. RESULTS: Based on inclusion criteria, five studies were included to meta-analysis. From those studies, the pooled prevalence of integrons was 33\% (95\% CI, 23.8-43.7\%) ranging from 23.8 to 52.4\%. There was a significant heterogeneity among the 5 studies (χ (2) = 11.73; p {\textless} 0.019; I (2) = 65.91\%). Additionally, Begg's and Egger's tests were performed to quantitatively evaluate the publication biases. According to the results of Begg's test (z = 1.22, p = 0.22) and Egger's test (t = 3.03, p = 0.056), a significant publication bias was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding revealed the relatively high prevalence of class 1 integrons among E. coli isolates. Moreover, there was a significant heterogeneity among studies and subgroup analysis also showed that there was no difference about prevalence of class 1 integrons among different sample source.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Results regarding the association between fish intake and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) are ambiguous. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate whether there is an association between fish consumption and risk of MetS. DATA SYNTHESIS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted of PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar up to August 2019. A random-effects model was used to pool the risk of MetS in the highest category of fish consumption compared with the lowest one. Subgroup analysis was conducted based on country of region, gender, dietary tool, MetS definition, energy adjustment and sample size. A dose-response of analysis of fish intake and risk of MetS was also conducted. Twelve studies with a total of 16 effect sizes (10 cross-sectional and six cohort) were included. An inverse association was observed between fish intake and risk of MetS in cohort (OR = 0.80, 95\% CI: 0.66, 0.96; P = 0.017, I(2) = 62.9\%) but not cross-sectional studies (OR = 0.80, 95\% CI: 0.70, 1.02; P = 0.085, I(2) = 50.1\%). Subgroup analysis suggested that the results were influenced by all the included variables but sample size. A significant non-linear association was observed between fish intake levels and risk of MetS (P-value for non-linearity = 0.010). CONCLUSION: An inverse association existed between fish intake and risk of MetS when combining data from prospective cohort studies. Further studies are needed to confirm such an effect.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Soil transmitted helminth (STH) infections still remain a notable health problem in resource-limited countries due to difficulties in the implementation of control measures. In Nigeria for instance, despite several community-based and provincial reports, national data on prevalence, burdens and risk zones (RZs) for STH infections are lacking. METHODS: The present study employed the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) to determine the prevalence, distribution and RZs for STH infections among Nigerian children through a meta-analysis of data published between 1980 and 2015. Pooled prevalence estimate (PPE) was determined by the random-effects model while heterogeneity was evaluated using the Cochran's Q-test. RESULTS: A total of 18 901 of the 34 518 Nigerian children aged 0-17 years examined across 19 Nigerian states during the period under review were infected with one or more species of STHs. The overall PPE for STH infections was 54.8\% (95\% CI: 54.2-55.3). PPEs for sub-groups ranged between 13.2\% (95\% CI: 11.5-15.1) and 80.9\% (95\% CI: 80.0-81.7). Highest PPEs for STH infections were observed among children within community settings (59.0\%, 95\% CI: 57.7-60.4) and school-aged children (54.9\%, 95\% CI: 54.3-55.5). Ascaris lumbricoides was the most prevalent species (44.6\%, 95\% CI: 44.0-45.2). Over 36\% (15/41) of the studies were published from south-western Nigeria. South-western region was the only high risk zone (HRZ) for STH infections while the rest of the regions were low risk zones (LRZs). CONCLUSIONS: STH infections involving Ascaris lumbricoides, Strongyloides stercoralis, Trichuris trichiura and hookworms are highly prevalent across Nigeria. Strategic use of anthelmintics, health education and adequate sanitation, taking into account this epidemiologic information will help in the control of these infections in Nigeria.},

In the present study, the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guideline was employed to determine the prevalence and geographical distribution of zoonotic helminths in food animals slaughtered in Nigerian abattoirs between 1970 and 2016. Pooled prevalence estimate (PPE) was determined by the random-effects model while heterogeneity was evaluated using the Cochran's Q-test. Results from 42 eligible studies reported across 19 Nigerian states revealed 85,466 cases of zoonotic helminths from 3,771,832 slaughtered food animals. Overall PPE was 2.27\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.25, 2.28). PPEs for sub-groups ranged between 0.51\% (95\% CI: 0.46, 0.56) and 18.05\% (95\% CI: 17.12, 19.01) across regions, hosts, study periods and diagnostic methods. Ascaris suum had the highest pooled prevalence of 25.46\% (95\% CI: 24.04, 26.92). Overall prevalence estimates for cestodes, nematodes and trematodes were 0.60\% (95\% CI: 0.59, 0.61), 21.51\% (95\% CI: 20.73, 22.30) and 1.86\% (95\% CI: 1.84, 1.87), respectively. A high degree of heterogeneity 99.97\% (95\% CI: 2.25, 2.28, P: 0.000) was observed. Zoonotic helminths were prevalent in slaughtered food animals, with higher prevalence estimates in the north-central region, pigs and during the last decade reviewed. Ascaris suum was the most prevalent helminth, while Fasciola gigantica had the widest geographical distribution. It is envisaged that the present information will help in the formulation of disease-control policies, encourage on-farm good agricultural practices, and adequate hygiene and sanitation in abattoirs and meat-processing plants, with the aim of protecting public health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The livestock industry plays a vital role in the economy of Nigeria. It serves as a major source of income and livelihood for majority of Nigerians who are rural settlers and contributes about 5.2\% to the National Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Helminths however, cause economic losses due to reductions in milk production, weight gain, fertility and carcass quality. Zoonotic helminths of livestock origin cause health problems in humans. METHODS: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, the prevalence and distribution of helminths of veterinary and zoonotic importance in Nigerian ruminants were determined in a meta-analysis of data published between 1970 and 2016. Data were stratified based on regions, hosts, study periods, sample sizes and study types while helminths were phylogenetically grouped into cestodes, nematodes and trematodes. RESULTS: Data from 44 studies reported across 19 Nigerian states revealed an overall pooled prevalence estimate (PPE) of 7.48\% (95\% CI: 7.38-7.57) for helminths of veterinary and zoonotic importance from a total of 320 208 ruminants. We observed a significant variation (P {\textless} 0.001) between the PPEs range of 1.90\% (95\% CI: 1.78-2.02) and 60.98\% (95\% CI: 58.37-63.55) reported across different strata. High heterogeneity (99.78, 95\% CI: 7.38-7.57) was observed. Strongyloides papillosus was the most prevalent (Prev: 32.02\%, 95\% CI: 31.01-33.11), while, Fasciola gigantica had the widest geographical distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Helminths of veterinary and zoonotic importance are prevalent in ruminants and well distributed across Nigeria. Our findings show that helminths of ruminants may also be possible causes of morbidity in humans and economic losses in the livestock industry in Nigeria. High heterogeneity was observed within studies and the different strata. Good agricultural practices on farms, standard veterinary meat inspection and adequate hygiene and sanitation in abattoirs, farms and livestock markets need to be implemented in Nigeria in order to reduce the economic, public health and veterinary threats due to these helminths.},

OBJECTIVE: Ten characteristics of English language primary IAV-S vaccine research, conducted at the level of the pig or higher, were charted to identify research gaps, topics for systematic review, and coverage across different publication types. DESIGN: Six online databases and grey literature were searched, without geographic, population, or study type restrictions, and abstracts screened independently and in duplicate for relevant research published between 1990 and May 2018. Full text data was charted by a single reviewer. RESULTS: Over 11,000 unique citations were screened, identifying 376 for charting, including 175 proceedings from 60 conferences, and 170 journal articles from 51 journals. Reported outcomes were heterogeneous with measures of immunity (86\%, n = 323) and virus detection (65\%, n = 246) reported far more than production metrics (9\%, n = 32). Study of transmissibility under conditions of natural exposure (n = 7), use of mathematical modelling (n = 11), and autogenous vaccine research reported in journals (n = 7), was limited. CONCLUSIONS: Most research used challenge trials (n = 219) and may have poor field relevance or suitability for systematic review if the purpose is to inform clinical decisions. Literature on vaccinated breeding herds (n = 89) and weaned pigs (n = 136) is potentially sufficient for systematic review. Research under field conditions is limited, disproportionately reported in conference proceedings versus journal articles, and may be insufficient to support systematic review.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The East African region is endemic with multiple zoonotic diseases and is one of the hotspots for emerging infectious zoonotic diseases with reported multiple outbreaks of epidemic diseases such as Ebola, Marburg and Rift Valley Fever. Here we present a systematic assessment of published research on zoonotic diseases in the region and thesis research in Kenya to understand the regional research focus and trends in publications, and estimate proportion of theses research transitioning to peer-reviewed journal publications. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar and African Journals Online databases for publications on 36 zoonotic diseases identified to have occurred in the East Africa countries of Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda, for the period between 1920 and 2017. We searched libraries and queried online repositories for masters and PhD theses on these diseases produced between 1970 and 2016 in five universities and two research institutions in Kenya. RESULTS: We identified 771 journal articles on 22, and 168 theses on 21 of the 36 zoonotic diseases investigated. Research on zoonotic diseases increased exponentially with the last 10 years of our study period contributing more than half of all publications 460 (60\%) and theses 102 (61\%) retrieved. Endemic diseases were the most studied accounting for 656 (85\%) and 150 (89\%) of the publication and theses studies respectively, with publications on epidemic diseases associated with outbreaks reported in the region or elsewhere. Epidemiological studies were the most common study types but limited to cross-sectional studies while socio-economics were the least studied. Only 11\% of the theses research transitioned to peer-review publications, taking an average of 2.5 years from theses production to manuscript publication. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate increased attention to zoonotic diseases in East Africa but reveal the need to expand the scope, focus and quality of studies to adequately address the public health, social and economic threats posed by zoonoses.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A wide range of Nipah virus (NiV) encephalitis case fatality rates (CFR) have been reported. Data on the involvement of several potential risk factors in Nipah virus transmission remain controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the pooled CFR of NiV encephalitis and to assess the risk factors for NiV infection. METHODS: Articles published up to the 27(th)of November 2018 in MedLine, Embase and Web of knowledge databases were considered for this study. We included cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies that have reported NiV CFR and/or risk factors. Data were pooled with random-effects model. This review was registered in the PROSPERO, CRD42018116242. FINDINGS: This global review included 22 citations (25 studies) including 2156, 1682, and 474 suspected, probable, and confirmed cases of NiV encephalitis, respectively. We determined a pooled CFR for NiV encephalitis at 61.0\% (95\% CI, 45.7-75.4; I² = 96.8\%). Climbing trees (OR = 1.4; 95\% CI; 1.0-1.9), male gender (OR = 1.5; 95\% CI; 1.1-2.0), travel outside their own sub-district (OR = 2.0; 95\% CI; 1.4-2.9), and exposure to date palm sap (DPS) (OR = 5.7; 95\% CI; 3.8-8.6) or pigs (OR = 7.6; 95\% CI; 1.2-45.4) were significantly associated with NiV infection. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study suggest that NiV Encephalitis is associated with a high CFR and that male gender, travel outside their sub-district, climbing trees, and exposure to pigs and DPS are associated with an increased risk of NiV encephalitis.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Existing evidence on the relationship between childhood lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) and the subsequent atopy development is controversial. We aimed to investigate an association between viral LRTI at {\textless}5 years and the development of atopy at {\textgreater} 2 years. METHODS: We conducted a search at Embase, Pubmed, Web of Science, and Global Index Medicus. We collected data from the included articles. We estimated the odds ratio and the 95\% confidence intervals with a random effect model. We determined factors associated with atopy development after childhood LRTI using univariate and multivariate meta-regression analyses. We recorded this systematic review at PROSPERO with the number CRD42018116955. RESULTS: We included 24 studies. There was no relationship between viral LRTI at {\textless}5 years and skin prick test-diagnosed-atopy (OR = 1.2, [95\% CI = 0.7-2.0]), unknown diagnosed-atopy (OR = 0.7, [95\% CI = 0.4-1.3]), atopic dermatitis (OR = 1.2, [95\% CI = 0.9-1.6]), hyperreactivity to pollen (OR = 0.8, [95\% CI = 0.3-2.7]), food (OR = 0.8, [95\% CI = 0.3-2.5]), or house dust mite (OR = 1.1, [95\% CI = 0.6-2.2]). Although not confirmed in all studies with a symmetric distribution of the 23 confounding factors investigated, the overall analyses showed that there was a relationship between childhood viral LRTI at {\textless} 5 years and serum test diagnosed-atopy (OR = 2.0, [95\% CI = 1.0-4.1]), allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (OR = 1.7, [95\% CI = 1.1-2.9]), hyperreactivity diagnosed by serum tests with food (OR = 5.3, [1.7-16.7]) or inhaled allergens (OR = 4.2, [95\% CI = 2.1-8.5]), or furred animals (OR = 0.6, [95\% CI = 0.5-0.9]). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that there is no association between viral LRTI at {\textless} 5 years and the majority of categories of atopy studied during this work. These results, however, are not confirmed for the remaining categories of atopy and more particularly those diagnosed by serum tests. There is a real need to develop more accurate atopy diagnostic tools.},

	abstract = {Accurate data on the Lassa virus (LASV) human case fatality rate (CFR) and the prevalence of LASV in humans, rodents and other mammals are needed for better planning of actions that will ultimately reduce the burden of LASV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. In this systematic review with meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Scopus, Africa Journal Online, and African Index Medicus from 1969 to 2020 to obtain studies that reported enough data to calculate LASV infection CFR or prevalence. Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently. We extracted all measures of current, recent, and past infections with LASV. Prevalence and CFR estimates were pooled using a random-effect meta-analysis. Factors associated with CFR, prevalence, and sources of between-study heterogeneity were determined using subgroup and metaregression analyses. This review was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020166465. We initially identified 1,399 records and finally retained 109 reports that contributed to 291 prevalence records from 25 countries. The overall CFR was 29.7\% (22.3-37.5) in humans. Pooled prevalence of LASV infection was 8.7\% (95\% confidence interval: 6.8-10.8) in humans, 3.2\% (1.9-4.6) in rodents, and 0.7\% (0.0-2.3) in other mammals. Subgroup and metaregression analyses revealed a substantial statistical heterogeneity explained by higher prevalence in tissue organs, in case-control, in hospital outbreak, and surveys, in retrospective studies, in urban and hospital setting, in hospitalized patients, and in West African countries. This study suggests that LASV infections is an important cause of death in humans and that LASV are common in humans, rodents and other mammals in sub-Saharan Africa. These estimates highlight disparities between sub-regions, and population risk profiles. Western Africa, and specific key populations were identified as having higher LASV CFR and prevalence, hence, deserving more attention for cost-effective preventive interventions.},

	abstract = {Fish farming in open water releases dissolved and particulate waste (inorganic and organic) into the surrounding marine environment. To reduce this environmental impact, commercial extractive species can be grown alongside to utilize and reduce this waste, a technique known as integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA). Information is lacking on whether (i) IMTA is generally successful with respect to extractive species growth responses and (ii) at what spatial scale they can be cultivated from fish cage nutrient sources. Focussing on bivalves and macroalgae as extractive species, this study uses a meta-analysis approach to summarize and conclude peer-reviewed data on IMTA to address these information gaps. We show that there are clear benefits to integrating bivalves and macroalgae with fish farms. Bivalves grown within, and relatively near, fish cages (0 m and 1-60 m distance categories, respectively) showed significantly higher biomass production relative to controls compared to those grown at larger spatial scales (61+ m). However, biomass production of macroalgae was significantly higher than controls only within close proximity to fish cages (0 m). This information shows increased extractive species production is generally greatest at relatively small spatial scales. It also highlights the need for more site-specific information (e.g. seawater parameters, hydrodynamics, food supply, farm capacity) in future studies. The allocation of control sites and locating these at suitable distances ({\textgreater}1-8 km) from fish farm effluent sources to avoid fish farm nutrient contamination are also recommended.},

Fourteen articles on the drug resistance of Clostridium species in Iran were included in the current study following a search in PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar databases using relevant keywords and screening based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Antibiotic resistance rates of C. difficile to ampicillin (42.8\%), ciprofloxacin (69.5\%), clindamycin (84.3\%), erythromycin (61.5\%), gentamicin (93.5\%), nalidixic acid (92.9\%), tetracycline (32.5\%), imipenem (39.6\%), levofloxacin (93.4\%), ertapenem (58.7\%), piperacillin/tazobactam (56.5\%), kanamycin (100\%), colistin (100\%), ceftazidime (76\%), amikacin (76.5\%), moxifloxacin (67.9\%) and cefotaxime (95\%) were high. In addition, resistance of C. perfringens to ampicillin (25.8\%), erythromycin (32.9\%), gentamicin (45.4\%), nalidixic acid (52.5\%), tetracycline (19.5\%), penicillin (21.8\%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (32.1\%), amoxicillin (19.3\%), imipenem (38\%), cloxacillin (100\%), oxacillin (45.6\%), bacitracin (89.1\%) and colistin (40\%) was high.

We performed a systematic review to determine the exact status of E. granulosus genotypes in the country. We explored English (Pubmed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science and Science Direct) and Persian (Magiran, Iran Medex and Scientific Information Database) databases along with Google Scholar. Our review included 73 studies published prior to the end of 2015. In total, 2952 animal (intermediate and definitive) hosts were examined, and the prevalent genotypes comprised G1 (92.75\%) and G6 (4.53\%) in sheep, cattle, camels, goats and buffaloes; G3 (2.43\%) in five herbivore hosts and dogs; G7 (0.2\%) in sheep and goats; and G2 (0.06\%) in dogs. G1 was mostly dominant in West Azerbaijan, whereas G3 and G6 were identified most frequently in the provinces of Isfahan and Fars, respectively. Regarding human CE infection, 340 cases were reported from Iran, with the identified genotypes G1 (n = 320), G6 (n = 13) and G3 (n = 7). Most CE-infected humans originated from Isfahan province (168 cases), whereas the lowest number of infected persons was noted in Kerman province (two cases). The information obtained from this systematic review is central to better understanding the biological and epidemiological characteristics of E. granulosus s.l. genotypes in Iran, leading to more comprehensive control strategies.},

The highest human seroprevalence was detected in Guilan province (326/452; 50\%). The pooled prevalence of the animal infections was calculated as 6.2\% (95\% CI = 5.8\%-6.5\%). In detail, the prevalence ranges in three hosts included as 4.2\% (95\% CI = 3.8\%-4.5\%) in sheep, 9\% (95\% CI = 8.0\%-9.9\%) in cattle and 3.1\% (95\% CI = 2.4\%-3.7\%) in goat. The highest prevalence rate was observed in the north, 11.8\% (95\% CI = 8.4\%-15.1\%), while the lowest prevalence was detected in the central Iran with 1.8\% (95\% CI = 1.3\%-2.3\%). Egger's regression test revealed no significant publication bias (P = 0.307). Also, there was no remarkable correlation between weighted prevalence and sample size (P = 0.249) as well as year of study (P = 0.172).

Although leptospirosis is known as an endemic disease in Iran, there is no accurate information on the overall prevalence of this disease in humans and animals. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the seroprevalence of leptospirosis among human and domestic and wild animals in Iran. A systematic review of English and Persian articles (since 1998 to December 2017) was conducted using Google Scholar, Medline/PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of science and Iranian databases Iranmedex, Scientific Information Database (SID), Magiran, and IRANDOC. Search terms include leptospirosis, Leptospira, serology, seroprevalence, seroepidemiology, serological, Iran, cow, goat, sheep, camel, dog, cat, equine, donkey, horse, mule and rodent. In Eventually 66 articles were selected to analyze based on inclusion criteria. Seroprevalence of leptospirosis in human was 27.84\% (95\% CI: 13.22-22.47) and 19.71\% (95\% CI: 6.78-32.65\%) based on ELISA and MAT, respectively. The pooled prevalence of leptospirosis in cow, sheep, goat and camel was 26.62\% (95\% CI: 18.76-34.48), 17.38\% (95\% CI: 13.32-21.43), 12.18\% (95\% CI: 9.96-14.41) and 22.68\% (95\% CI: 18.97-26.40), respectively. The prevalence of leptospirosis in horse, donkey, and mule was 19.99\% (95\% CI: 13.32-26.68), 40.59\% (95\% CI: 33.20-47.97) and 9.10\% (95\% CI: 2.90-15.30), respectively. The prevalence in dog and cat were estimated 14.63\% (95\% CI: 3.49-25.77) and 14.44\% (95\% CI: 3.25-25.65), respectively. The prevalence of seropositivity in rodents was estimated 20.96\% (95\% CI: 10.62-31.30). This study is a very comprehensive report on the status of leptospirosis in Iran. Based on our results, leptospirosis has considerable seroprevalence among human and animals in Iran. This high seroprevalence of leptospirosis showed should be given more attention for this disease in Iran and thus health measures must be taken to diagnosis, control and prevent it.},

There are studies on the prevalence of this infection in animal and human reservoirs in Iran; hence, we conducted this meta-analysis to elucidate the prevalence of CE in Iran. English (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct and Google Scholar) and Persian (Magiran, Iran Medex, Iran Doc and SID) databases were explored. In the case of definitive, animal and human intermediate hosts, 37, 90 and 33 studies, respectively, have been included in the current review from January 1990 to December 2015. According to outcomes of the heterogeneity test, either Der Simonian and Laird's random-effects method or Mantel-Haenszel's fixed-effects method were employed to pool the estimations. The pooled prevalence of Echinococcus granulosus infection in definitive hosts was calculated as 23.6\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 17.6-30.1\%). The weighted prevalence of animal and human hydatidosis was calculated as 15.6\% (95\% CI = 14.2-17.1\%) and 4.2\% (95\% CI = 3.0-5.5\%), respectively. Meanwhile, most cases of human hydatidosis were in southern Iran, with a prevalence of 5.8\% (3.2-9.2\%). In terms of human hydatidosis, more infections were found in rural regions, and mostly in female individuals. Egger's regression test revealed publication bias, with a remarkable impact on total prevalence of the infection in animal intermediate hosts (P {\textless} 0.001), while it was not significant in human hosts (P = 0.4) and definitive hosts (P = 0.3). According to the weighted estimated prevalence of cystic echinococcosis and its financial burden, implementing appropriate control programmes should be compulsory to decrease the burden of the disease in Iran.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pntd.0006722},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tick-borne zoonoses in the Order Rickettsiales and Legionellales cause infections that often manifest as undifferentiated fevers that are not easy to distinguish from other causes of acute febrile illnesses clinically. This is partly attributed to difficulty in laboratory confirmation since convalescent sera, specific diagnostic reagents, and the required expertise may not be readily available. As a result, a number of tick-borne zoonoses are underappreciated resulting in unnecessary morbidity, mortality and huge economic loses. In Iran, a significant proportion of human infectious diseases are tick-borne, with anecdotal evidence suggesting that tick-borne zoonoses are widespread but underreported in the country. Epidemiological review is therefore necessary to aid in the effective control and prevention of tick-borne zonooses in Iran. The aim of this review is to provide an in-depth and comprehensive overview of anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, spotted fever group rickettsioses and coxiellosis in Iran. METHODS: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, all relevant publications on tick-borne zoonoses in the Order Rickettsiales and Legionellales in Iran were searched using a number of search terms. The search was confined to authentic resources from repositories of popular data bases among them PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Science Direct, SpringerLink and SCOPUS. The search items included peer reviewed journals, books and book chapters published between 1996 and 2017. RESULTS: A total of 1 205 scientific publications and reports were sourced, of which 63 met the search criteria and were reviewed. Of the 63 articles reviewed, 36 (57.1\%) reported on coxiellosis, 15 (23.8\%) on anaplasmosis, 11 (17.5\%) on ehrlichiosis and 1(1.6\%) on spotted fever group rickettsiae in a large scale study involving four countries, among them Iran. The existence of tick-borne pathogens in the Order Rickettsiales and Legionellales was confirmed by molecular, serological and microscopic techniques conducted on samples obtained from sheep, cattle, goats, camels, poultry, animal products (milk and eggs), dogs, ticks and even human subjects in different parts of the country; pointing to a countrywide distribution. DISCUSSION: Based on the review, coxiellosis, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, and SFG rickettsiae can be categorized as emerging tick-borne zoonotic diseases in Iran given the presence of their causiative agents (C. burnetii, A. phagocytophilum, A. marginale, A. bovis, A. ovis, A. central, E. canis, E. ewingii, E. chaffeensis and R. conorii) collectively reported in a variety of domestic animals, animal products, arthropods and human beings drawn from 22 provinces in Iran. CONCLUSION: Given the asymptomatic nature of some of these zoonoses, there is a high likelihood of silent transmission to humans in many parts of the country, which should be considered a public health concern. Presently, information on the transmission intensity of tick-borne zoonoses caused by pathogens in the Order Rickettsiales and Legionellales to humans and its public health impact in Iran is scanty.},

	abstract = {Equines are subject to infection with many parasites, which threaten their health. In the present study, we systematically reviewed existing literature on the prevalence of endo- and ectoparasites of equines in Iran. Major electronic databases, including PubMed, PubMed Central, Google Scholar, Science Direct and Scientific Information Database (SID), were searched (Last updated 11/05/2018) for relevant literature of parasites that have been identified from equines in Iran. Of the 1809 titles produced by bibliographic search, 38 were included in the review. Twenty-seven of the studies were on horses, six on donkeys, three on both horses and donkeys, and one study was on both horses and mules. Furthermore, 24 of the studies reported infections caused by protozoa, thirteen by helminths, two by ectoparasites, and one by both protozoa and helminths. The overall pooled prevalence of parasitic infection was 28.8\% (95\%CI: 22.9-35.7, I(2)  = 93.4\%). Helminths were the most prevalent parasites 46.7\% (95\% CI: 24.1-70.7, I(2)  = 96.0\%). Furthermore, donkeys were the most affected equine, with a prevalence of 70.7\% (95\% CI: 53.2-83.7, I(2)  = 92.5\%). The protozoa frequently reported included nine species belonging to the genera: Neospora, Toxoplasma, Theileria, Babesia and Eimeria. Also, the helminths frequently reported included 21 species belonging to the genera: Strongylus, Dicrocoelium, Oxyuris, Habronema, Echinococcus, Dictyocaulus, Cyathostomum, Probstmayria, Anoplocephala, Setaria and Fasciola. Ticks were the only ectoparasites frequently reported. Parasitic fly species of the genera Gasterophilus were also reported. The study-level risk of bias was likely to be high because of differences in study design. Parasitic infections of equines in Iran are frequent and caused by a diversity of parasites, which threatens the health and well-being of these animals. Further research is needed in the area to identify the risk factors of infection for effective control of the parasites.},

	abstract = {Urolithiasis is one of the oldest diseases affecting humans, while plants are one of our oldest companions providing food, shelter, and medicine. In spite of substantial progress in understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms, treatment options are still limited, often expensive for common people in most parts of the world. As a result, there is a great interest in herbal remedies for the treatment of urinary stone disease as an alternative or adjunct therapy. Numerous in vivo and in vitro studies have been carried out to understand the efficacy of herbs in reducing stone formation. We adopted PRISMA guidelines and systematically reviewed PubMed/Medline for the literature, reporting results of various herbal products on in vivo models of nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis. The Medical Subject Heading Terms (Mesh term) "Urolithiasis" was used with Boolean operator "AND" and other related Mesh Unique terms to search all the available records (July 2019). A total of 163 original articles on in vivo experiments were retrieved from PubMed indexed with the (MeshTerm) "Urolithiasis" AND "Complementary Therapies/Alternative Medicine, "Urolithiasis" AND "Plant Extracts" and "Urolithiasis" AND "Traditional Medicine". Most of the studies used ethylene glycol (EG) to induce hyperoxaluria and nephrolithiasis in rats. A variety of extraction methods including aqueous, alcoholic, hydro-alcoholic of various plant parts ranging from root bark to fruits and seeds, or a combination thereof, were utilized. All the investigations did not study all aspects of nephrolithiasis making it difficult to compare the efficacy of various treatments. Changes in the lithogenic factors and a reduction in calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystal deposition in the kidneys were, however, considered favorable outcomes of the various treatments. Less than 10\% of the studies examined antioxidant and diuretic activities of the herbal treatments and concluded that their antiurolithic activities were a result of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and/or diuretic effects of the treatments.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is reported as one of the most common cancers among females worldwide. Infectious agents especially viruses have been considered as role players in the development of breast cancer. Although some investigations suggest an association between bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and breast cancer, the involvement of this virus as a risk factor remains controversial. The present study aimed to find out any possible association between BLV and breast cancer through conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Systematic literature search was performed by finding related case-control articles from the PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE databases. The heterogeneity and the multivariable-adjusted OR and corresponding 95\% CI were applied by meta-analysis and forest plot across studies. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14.1. RESULT: Based on a comprehensive literature search, 9 case-control studies were included for meta-analysis. The combination of all included studies showed that BLV infection is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer [summary OR (95\% CI) 2.57 (1.45, 4.56)]. CONCLUSION: This is the first meta-analysis to analyze a potential association between BLV infection and the risk of breast cancer. Control of the infection in cattle herds and screening of the milk and dairy products may help to reduce the transmission of the virus to humans.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the last decade resveratrol has been trialled for the prevention and treatment of cognitive decline; however, the results have shown a conflict between human studies compared with animal studies, especially on cognition, blood pressure, neuroimaging, and mood. METHODS: Human clinical trials and animal studies published prior to January 2020, were identified searching across major electronic databases. PRISMA guidelines were used for data extraction, which was independently performed by two authors. Pooled standard mean difference (SMD, random effect model) and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated. RESULTS: Most publications on animal models reported positive outcomes on cognition and brain function following exposure to resveratrol or grape seed extracts. By contrast, 11 meta-analyses of data from human placebo vs resveratrol, grape or wine treatment trials identified no statistically significant effect on a variety of measures, including cognitive and mood assessments, grey matter volume and blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Based on currently available data, the promising effects of resveratrol in animal models is not replicated in human clinical trials. The effects, if any, of resveratrol on human cognition are likely to be small. This work may be useful for the design and implementation of future pre-clinical and clinical studies using resveratrol in a neurological setting.},

	abstract = {Cancer and infectious diseases are the preeminent causes of human morbidities and mortalities worldwide. At present, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and gene therapy are considered as predominant options in order to treat cancer. But these therapies provide inadequate consequences by affecting both the normal and tumor cells. On the other hand, tuberculosis (TB), and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infections are significant threats, causing over a million mortalities each year. The extensive applications of antibiotics have caused the microbes to acquire resistance to the existing antibiotics. With the emerging dilemma of drug resistant microbes, it has become imperative to identify novel therapeutic agents from natural sources as emphatic alternative approach. Over the past few decades, venoms derived from several reptiles, amphibians, and arthropods including snakes, scorpions, frogs, spiders, honey bees, wasps, beetles, caterpillars, ants, centipedes, and sponges have been identified as efficient therapeutics. Venoms constitute plethora of bioactive components, particularly peptides, enzymes, and other chemical entities, which exhibit a large array of anticancer and anti-pathogenic activities. This review highlights the panorama of bioactive components of animal venoms divulging the anticancer, anti-tubercular, and anti-HIV activities. In a nutshell, this context discloses the decisive role of animal venoms as alternative natural resources to combat these deadly diseases of 21(st) century, and propounding the plausible development of new therapeutic drugs in the present era.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sparganosis is a larval cestodiasis caused by the plerocercoid of Spirometra spp. Since the first description of human sparganosis in 1924, several hundred cases have been reported in Korea. However, systematic approaches for literature surveys of Korean sparganosis have seldom appeared. METHODS: We searched publicly available databases such as PubMed, Research Information Sharing Service, and Korea Medical Citation Index with relevant Medical Subject Headings. RESULTS: At least 438 Korean sparganosis cases have been described from 1924 to 2015. Preoperative diagnosis has been significantly increased since the 1980s due to popularization of serological and imaging diagnostics. Cases were largely detected from fifth decades in general, but cerebral sparganosis was detected in relatively young age groups (third and fourth decades). Sparganosis was prevalent in men (75.9\%). Consumption of frog/snake and drinking unfiltered water were found in 63.4\% and 16.9\% of patients, respectively. Most frequently affected sites were subcutaneous tissues (49.9\%), followed by the central nervous system (36.2\%). Involvements of visceral organs (7.6\%), ocular regions (3.6\%), and muscles (2.7\%) were noticed. In women, breast sparganosis constituted a large proportion (34.2\%). Sparganosis associated with immunocompromised patients has recently been reported. CONCLUSION: Sparganosis has been continuously reported in Korea during the past 90 years, although its incidence has decreased during the last 20 years. The disease is mostly characterized by subcutaneous nodule, but infection of the worm in vital organs often results in serious illness. Continuous awareness is warranted to monitor sparganosis occurrence and associated clinical consequences.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Globally cryptosporidiosis is one of the commonest causes of mortality in children under 24 months old and may be associated with important longterm health effects. Whilst most strains of Cryptosporidium parvum are zoonotic, C. parvum IIc is almost certainly anthroponotic. The global distribution of this potentially important emerging infection is not clear. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of papers identifying the subtype distribution of C. parvum infections globally. We searched PubMed and Scopus using the following key terms Cryptospor* AND parvum AND (genotyp* OR subtyp* OR gp60). Studies were eligible for inclusion if they had found C. parvum within their human study population and had subtyped some or all of these samples using standard gp60 subtyping. Pooled analyses of the proportion of strains being of the IIc subtype were determined using StatsDirect. Meta-regression analyses were run to determine any association between the relative prevalence of IIc and Gross Domestic Product, proportion of the population with access to improved drinking water and improved sanitation. RESULTS: From an initial 843 studies, 85 were included in further analysis. Cryptosporidium parvum IIc was found in 43 of these 85 studies. Across all studies the pooled estimate of relative prevalence of IIc was 19.0\% (95\% CI: 12.9-25.9\%), but there was substantial heterogeneity. In a meta-regression analysis, the relative proportion of all C. parvum infections being IIc decreased as the percentage of the population with access to improved sanitation increased and was some 3.4 times higher in those studies focussing on HIV-positive indivduals. CONCLUSIONS: The anthroponotic C. parvum IIc predominates primarily in lower-income countries with poor sanitation and in HIV-positive individuals. Given the apparent enhanced post-infectious virulence of the other main anthroponotic species of Cryptosporidium (C. hominis), it is important to learn about the impact of this subtype on human health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence-based treatments for service-related health conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are not effective for all veterans. Equine-assisted interventions are emerging as an additional treatment modality, but little is known regarding the safe and effective delivery of these interventions. This study aimed to describe the following features of the body of literature concerning equine-assisted interventions among veterans: 1) veterans who have participated in equine-assisted interventions; 2) specific characteristics of equine-assisted interventions in veterans; and 3) the specific characteristics of research on equine-assisted interventions in veterans. METHODS: We conducted a systematic mapping review of peer-reviewed literature reporting on equine-assisted interventions among veterans between 1980 and 2017. Searches of nine databases yielded 3336 unique records, six of which met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Data relevant to the study aims were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: Equine-assisted interventions among veterans disproportionately targeted psychosocial outcomes and yielded promising results. The detailed methods of EAI varied in the reported studies, ranging from communicating with the horse to mounted exercises. There was also great diversity in outcome measurement. The state of theoretical development regarding the mechanisms by which equine-assisted interventions benefit the veteran population is currently underdeveloped. Studies provided insufficient detail with respect to the description of the intervention, reasons for attrition, and the dose-response relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Scientific development of equine-assisted interventions targeting psychosocial outcomes among veterans is warranted to establish their efficacy. Targeted outcomes should be expanded, including outcomes more closely aligned with the nature of polytraumatic injuries. Future research must also emphasize the theoretical development of equine-assisted interventions for veterans and thoroughly describe the participants, components of the intervention, factors contributing to attrition, and optimal dose-response relationships.},

	abstract = {The neurotransmitter Substance P, and its neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R) are involved in the regulation of many pathophysiological processes including emesis, inflammation and nociceptive processing. This review provides a brief summary of the anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties of experimental NK-1R antagonists followed by a systematic review and meta-analysis on maropitant, the only NK-1R antagonist with a label indication for emesis in veterinary patients. There is very limited evidence based information on the putative clinical utilisation of maropitant for pain and inflammation. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate published reports on anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anaesthesia-sparing effects of maropitant. Medline, Pubmed, Science direct and Web of Science were searched to identify all published studies on maropitant, followed by a meta-analysis. Fourteen studies with 128 animals receiving maropitant and 127 controls met the inclusion criteria. Overall, maropitant had a significant inhalation anaesthetic-sparing effect (SMD -0.92, 95\% CI -1.30, -0.54; P {\textless} 0.00001). However, treatment with maropitant had no effect on pain (SMD 0.06, 95\% CI -0.37, 0.48; P = 0.80), or leukocyte cell infiltration in different inflammatory conditions (SMD -0.60, 95\% CI -1.31, 0.11; P = 0.10). Based on all eligible studies for this review, it can be deduced that maropitant significantly reduced the minimum alveolar concentrations for isoflurane and sevoflurane for many different surgical procedures but it had no clearly proven effect on inflammation and pain.},

A systematic literature search was conducted in line with the PRISMA guidelines, and 68 out of 677 articles qualified for the final analysis. The average methodological quality of the studies was suboptimal with 7 out of 11 points as assessed by a modified Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine score. Histology of the chronically rejected graft was almost universally integrated as outcome parameter but we found significant heterogeneity in utilized transplant techniques, organ preservation, immunosuppression and time points of CR-assessment. Several studies identified cellular and humoral immunologic mechanisms in chronic intestinal rejection. Yet, neither preventive nor therapeutic strategies against CR have been successfully introduced into human intestinal transplantation highlighting the persistent need for optimized experimental models. In this review, we aim to improve the translational value of forthcoming investigations on CR by discussing the experimental status quo and potential innovative approaches.},

	abstract = {The global burden of antimicrobial resistance is on the rise, resulting in higher morbidity and mortality in our communities. The spread of antimicrobial resistance in the environment and development of resistant microbes is a challenge to the control of antimicrobial resistance. Approaches, such as antimicrobial stewardship programmes and enhanced surveillance, have been devised to curb its spread. However, particularly in lower- and middle-income countries, the overall extent of antimicrobial resistance and knowledge on ongoing surveillance, stewardship or investigation efforts, are often poorly understood. This study aimed to look at the efforts that have been undertaken to detect and combat antimicrobial resistance in Uganda as a means of establishing an overview of the situation, to help inform future decisions. We conducted a systematic literature review of the PubMed database to assess these efforts. A search combining keywords associated with antimicrobial resistance were used to find relevant studies between 1995 and 2020 on surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in Uganda, and susceptibility of microbes to different drugs. The search yielded 430 records, 163 of which met the inclusion criteria for analysis. The studies were categorized according to country and region, the type of antimicrobial resistance, context of the study, study design and outcome of the study. We observed that antibacterial resistance and antimalarial resistance had the most published studies while antiviral and antifungal resistance were represented by very few studies each. Most studies were conducted in humans and hospital settings, with few in veterinary and One Health contexts, and only one that included environmental sampling. The majority of studies have focused on surveillance, susceptibility testing or resistance genes; none of our included papers had a policy or stewardship focus. The results from our work can inform public health policy on antimicrobial stewardship as it contributes to understanding the status of antimicrobial resistance surveillance in Uganda, and can also help to guide future research efforts. Notably, a One Health approach needs to be followed with respect to surveillance of antimicrobial resistance to better understand the mechanisms of resistance transfer across the human-animal-environment interface, including additional investigation in antiviral and antifungal resistance.},

Although many mutations have been described, little is known about the optimal treatment strategy for fibrotic interstitial pneumonia patients with surfactant-processing mutations.We performed a systematic literature review of studies that described a drug effect in patients, cell or mouse models with a surfactant-processing mutation. In total, 73 articles were selected, consisting of 55 interstitial lung disease case reports/series, two clinical trials and 16 cell or mouse studies. Clinical effect parameters included lung function, radiological characteristics and clinical symptoms, while experimental outcome parameters included chemokine/cytokine expression, surfactant trafficking, necrosis and apoptosis. SP600125, a c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor, hydroxychloroquine and 4-phenylbutyric acid were most frequently studied in disease models and lead to variable outcomes, suggesting that outcome is mutation dependent.This systematic review summarises effect parameters for future studies on surfactant-processing disorders in disease models and provides directions for future trials in affected patients.},

Recently, metabolomics has become important for understanding the functional relevance of gut microbial changes in disease. Animal models for IBD enable the study of factors involved in disease development. However, results from animal studies may not represent the human situation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether results from metabolomics studies on animal models for IBD were similar to those from studies on IBD patients. Medline and Embase were searched for relevant studies up to May 2017. The Covidence systematic review software was used for study screening, and quality assessment was conducted for all included studies. Data showed a convergence of {\textasciitilde}17\% for metabolites differentiated between IBD and controls in human and animal studies with amino acids being the most differentiated metabolite subclass. The acute dextran sodium sulfate model appeared as a good model for analysis of systemic metabolites in IBD, but analytical platform, age, and biological sample type did not show clear correlations with any significant metabolites. In conclusion, this systematic review highlights the variation in metabolomics results, and emphasizes the importance of expanding the applied detection methods to ensure greater coverage and convergence between the various different patient phenotypes and animal models of inflammatory bowel disease.},

	abstract = {Background: Acupuncture has been reported to have significant effects, not only in alleviating impaired motor function, but also rescuing dopaminergic neuron deficits in rodent models of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, a systemic analysis of these beneficial effects has yet to be performed. Objective: To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of acupuncture in animal models of PD. Methods: A literature search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Research Information Service System, and Japan Society of Acupuncture and Moxibustion databases was performed to retrieve studies that investigated the effects of acupuncture on PD. The quality of each included study was evaluated using the 10-item checklist modified from the Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies. RevMan version 5.3 (Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used for meta-analysis. Results: The 42 studies included scored between 2 and 7 points, with a mean score of 4.6. Outcome measures included tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) level and dopamine content. Meta-analysis results revealed statistically significant effects of acupuncture for increasing both TH levels (33.97 [95\% CI 33.15-34.79]; p {\textless} 0.00001) and dopamine content (4.23 [95\% CI 3.53-4.92]; p {\textless} 0.00001) compared with that observed in PD control groups. In addition, motor dysfunctions exhibited by model PD animals were also mitigated by acupuncture treatment. Conclusions: Although there were limitations in the number and quality of the included studies, results of this analysis suggest that acupuncture exerts a protective effect on dopaminergic neurons in rodent models of PD.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in healthcare settings challenges clinicians worldwide. However, little is known about dissemination of CRE in livestock, food, and companion animals and potential transmission to humans. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of all studies published in the PubMed database between 1980 and 2017 and included those reporting the occurrence of CRE in samples from food-producing and companion animals, wildlife, and exposed humans. The primary outcome was the occurrence of CRE in samples from these animals; secondary outcomes included the prevalence of CRE, carbapenemase types, CRE genotypes, and antimicrobial susceptibilities. RESULTS: We identified 68 articles describing CRE among pigs, poultry, cattle, seafood, dogs, cats, horses, pet birds, swallows, wild boars, wild stork, gulls, and black kites in Africa, America, Asia, Australia, and Europe. The following carbapenemases have been detected (predominantly affecting the genera Escherichia and Klebsiella): VIM, KPC, NDM, OXA, and IMP. Two studies found that 33-67\% of exposed humans on poultry farms carried carbapenemase-producing CRE closely related to isolates from the farm environment. Twenty-seven studies selectively screened samples for CRE and found a prevalence of {\textless}1\% among livestock and companion animals in Europe, 2-26\% in Africa, and 1-15\% in Asia. Wildlife (gulls) in Australia and Europe carried CRE in 16-19\%. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of CRE in livestock, seafood, wildlife, pets, and directly exposed humans poses a risk for public health. Prospective prevalence studies using molecular and cultural microbiological methods are needed to better define the scope and transmission of CRE.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Damage to critical brain regions causes deficits in important neurological functions. Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) has been shown to promote neuroplasticity and may ameliorate neurological deficits caused by disease or trauma. This systematic review identifies and evaluates preclinical studies of ChABC as a treatment for acute brain injury. METHODS: Four databases were searched for studies relating to ChABC and brain or brain injuries. Controlled studies in mammals with acute brain injuries treated with ChABC were included in meta-analyses of neurobehavioural outcomes. Means and standard deviations from the fifth day of treatment were extracted, and normalised mean differences were calculated. RESULTS: Of 775 identified records, 16 studies administered ChABC after acute brain injury, of which 9 reported neurobehavioural outcomes. The estimated treatment effect on neurological recovery over the duration of included studies was 49.4\% (CI: 30.3-68.4\% with Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman adjustment, p = 0.0002). The mechanisms of action may involve decreasing astroglial scar formation, promoting neuronal sprouting, and selective synaptic strengthening of sprouting neurites and activated neural pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The summary of published evidence suggests that ChABC treatment is effective in improving neurological outcomes in preclinical models of acute brain injury. However, more studies are needed for better assessment of the specific translational potential of ChABC.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To provide a systematic literature review on effectiveness of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and Shunt (AVS) research animal models. BACKGROUND: Due to advancing human population age, there is increased incidence of patients suffering from vascular and renal diseases leading to dialysis access using AVF and/or AVS. During those interventions native venous or synthetic grafts are arterialized. Despite temporary good patency, complications are a consequence of neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) development that contributes to patients' morbidity and mortality. Basic research attempts to elucidate the pathomechanisms, therefore the small and large animal models are becoming attractive. METHODS: Medline search (within 1966-2018) was performed on AVF/AVS animal models. Studies fulfilled following criteria: (1) reported complete material-methods-results section, (2) included statistically significant number of animals, (3) provided statistically significant results. 55 articles were identified encompassing six animal species used. RESULTS: Large animal models include creation of AVF and AVS in pig, sheep and dog. Porcine animal models use pelvic or femoral vessels, ovine use the common carotid artery (CCA) and jugular vein (JV). Canine animal models use the femoral vessels. Small animal models use rabbit (CCA/JV), rat (JV/CCA, abdominal aorta /Vena cava inferior and femoral artery/femoral vein) and mouse (aortocaval and supraortic AVF models). CONCLUSIONS: Large animal models are best for haemodynamic shear stress studies and in vivo evaluation of new synthetic vascular grafts. Small animal models, especially the genetically manipulated ones, are ideal for analysis of molecular and cellular pathomechanisms. The selection of animal species to be used depends on the addressed research question.},

Data regarding the study design/grouping, subjects, age/gender, duration of follow-up, outcome variables and parameters related to OTM and statins administration were evaluated. RESULTS: Nine studies (1 clinical and 8 studies performed in animal-models) were included. Six studies used Simvastatin, whereas three studies used Atorvastatin. Six experimental studies and one clinical study reported reduction in OTM upon statin administration. Two experimental studies reported no effect of statin administration on OTM. In 90 \% of the studies, the risk-of-bias was high. CONCLUSION: Based upon the high risk-of-bias and methodological inconsistencies among the included studies, the influence of statin delivery on OTM remains debatable.},

FGR is postulated to impact blood pressure (BP) by developmental programming. This systematic review and meta-analysis studies BP in human and animal offspring following FGR. Pubmed and Web of Science were searched for studies reporting on BP after placental insufficiency induced FGR compared with normal growth controls. Primary outcome was mean absolute BP difference (ΔBP mm Hg [95\% CI]). Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses were executed on species, sex, age, pregnancy duration, and stress during BP readings. Due to large interspecies heterogeneity, analyses were performed separately for human (n=41) and animal (n=31) studies, the latter restricted to rats (n=27). Human studies showed a ΔBP between FGR and controls of -0.6 mm Hg ([95\% CI, -1.7 to 0.6]; I(2)=91\%). Mean ΔBP was -2.6 mm Hg (95\% CI, -5.7 to 0.4) in women versus -0.5 mm Hg (95\% CI, -3.7 to 2.7) in men. Subgroup analyses did not indicate age, gestational age, and stress during measurements as sources of heterogeneity. In rats, mean BP was 12.0 mm Hg ([95\% CI, 8.8-15.2]; I(2)=81\%) higher in FGR offspring. This difference was more pronounced in FGR males (13.6 mm Hg [95\% CI, 10.3-17.0] versus 9.1 mm Hg [95\% CI, 5.3-12.8]). Subgroup analyses on age showed no statistical interaction. BP readings under restrained conditions resulted in larger BP differences between FGR and control rats (15.3 mm Hg [95\% CI, 11.6-18.9] versus 5.7 mm Hg [95\% CI, 1.1-10.3]). Rat studies confirm the relation between FGR and offspring BP, while observational studies in humans do not show such differences. This may be due to the observational nature of human studies, methodological limitations, or an absence of this phenomenon in humans. Clinical Trial Registration URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

The objective of the study was to systematically identify the effects of MC4R antagonists on hypersensitivity in rat models of neuropathic pain. A systematic search was conducted using the following databases: WoS, PubMed, SCOPUS, and MEDLINE. Inclusion criteria were: rat hypersensitivity induced by models of neuropathic pain with reported effects of MC4R antagonist. Two researchers performed the selection process and data extraction. SYRCLE risk of bias tool was used. Standard mean differences (SMD) were calculated and pooled by meta-analysis using random effect models. Ten articles met the eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The results reveal that, in animals exposed to neuropathic pain, administration of MC4R antagonists significantly increased paw withdrawal threshold (SHU9119 SMD = 1.67, 95\% CI: [0.91, 2.44], I(2)  = 0\%; HS014 SMD = 2.2, 95\% CI: [0.53, 3.87], I(2)  = 71\%) and heat withdrawal latency (HS014 SMD = 3.35, 95\% CI: [0.56, 6.14], I(2)  = 83\%) compared to vehicle-treated animals. MC4R antagonists are effective in the alleviation of hypersensitivity in rodent neuropathic pain models. SHU9119 and HS014 antagonists showed the most prominent results.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fabry disease (FD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder that might result in, amongst other complications, early stroke and white matter lesions (WMLs). More insight in WMLs in FD could clarify the role of WMLs in the disease presentation and prognosis in FD. In this systematic review we assessed the prevalence, severity, location and course of WMLs in FD. We also systematically reviewed the evidence on the relation between WMLs, disease characteristics and clinical parameters. METHODS: We searched Pubmed, EMBASE and CINAHL (inception to Feb 2018) and identified articles reporting on FD and WMLs assessed with MRI. Prevalence and severity were assessed for all patients combined and divided by sex. RESULTS: Out of 904 studies a total of 46 studies were included in the analyses. WMLs were present in 46\% of patients with FD (581 out of 1276 patients, corrected mean age: 38.8 years, range 11.8-79.3) and increased with age. A total of 16.4\% of patients (31 out of 189 patients, corrected mean age: 41.1 years, range 35.8-43.3 years) showed substantial confluent WMLs. Men and women showed comparable prevalence and severity of WMLs. However, men were significantly younger at time of WML assessment. Patients with classical FD had a higher chance on WMLs compared to non-classical patients. Progression of WMLs was seen in 24.6\% of patients (49 out of 199 patients) during 38.1 months follow-up. Progression was seen in both men and women, with and without enzyme replacement therapy, but at an earlier age in men. Stroke seemed to be related to WMLs, but cerebrovascular risk factors, cardiac and renal (dys)function did not. Pathology in the brain in FD seemed to extend beyond the WMLs into the normal appearing white matter. CONCLUSIONS: A significant group of FD patients has substantial WMLs and male patients develop WMLs earlier compared to female patients. WMLs could be used in clinical trials to evaluate possible treatment effects on the brain. Future studies should focus on longitudinal follow-up using modern imaging techniques, focusing on the clinical consequences of WMLs. In addition, ischemic and non-ischemic pathways resulting in WML development should be studied.},

	abstract = {The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the adjacent light-sensitive photoreceptors form a single functional unit lining the back of the eye. Both cell layers are essential for normal vision. RPE degeneration is usually followed by photoreceptor degeneration and vice versa. There are currently almost no effective therapies available for RPE disorders such as Stargardt disease, specific types of retinitis pigmentosa, and age-related macular degeneration. RPE replacement for these disorders, especially in later stages of the disease, may be one of the most promising future therapies. There is, however, no consensus regarding the optimal RPE source, delivery strategy, or the optimal experimental host in which to test RPE replacement therapy. Multiple RPE sources, delivery methods, and recipient animal models have been investigated, with variable results. So far, a systematic evaluation of the (variables influencing) efficacy of experimental RPE replacement parameters is lacking. Here we investigate the effect of RPE transplantation on vision and vision-based behavior in animal models of retinal degenerated diseases. In addition, we aim to explore the effect of RPE source used for transplantation, the method of intervention, and the animal model which is used. METHODS: In this study, we systematically identified all publications concerning transplantation of RPE in experimental animal models targeting the improvement of vision (e.g., outcome measurements related to the morphology or function of the eye). A variety of characteristics, such as species, gender, and age of the animals but also cell type, number of cells, and other intervention characteristics were extracted from all studies. A risk of bias analysis was performed as well. Subsequently, all references describing one of the following outcomes were analyzed in depth in this systematic review: a-, b-, and c-wave amplitudes, vision-based, thickness analyses based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) data, and transplant survival based on scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) data. Meta-analyses were performed on the a- and b-wave amplitudes from electroretinography (ERG) data as well as data from vision-based behavioral assays. RESULTS: original research articles met the inclusion criteria after two screening rounds. Overall, most studies were categorized as unclear regarding the risk of bias, because many experimental details were poorly reported. Twenty-three studies reporting one or more of the outcome measures of interest were eligible for either descriptive (thickness analyses based on OCT data; n = 2) or meta-analyses. RPE transplantation significantly increased ERG a-wave (Hedges' g 1.181 (0.471-1.892), n = 6) and b-wave (Hedges' g 1.734 (1.295-2.172), n = 42) amplitudes and improved vision-based behavior (Hedges' g 1.018 (0.826-1.209), n = 96). Subgroup analyses revealed a significantly increased effect of the use of young and adolescent animals compared to adult animals. Moreover, transplanting more cells (in the range of 10(5) versus in the range of 10(4)) resulted in a significantly increased effect on vision-based behavior as well. The origin of cells mattered as well. A significantly increased effect was found on vision-based behavior when using ARPE-19 and OpRegen(®) RPE. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review shows that RPE transplantation in animal models for retinal degeneration significantly increases a- and b- wave amplitudes and improves vision-related behavior. These effects appear to be more pronounced in young animals, when the number of transplanted cells is larger and when ARPE-19 and OpRegen(®) RPE cells are used. We further emphasize that there is an urgent need for improving the reporting and methodological quality of animal experiments, to make such studies more comparable.},

The potential for reinnervation of the ACL graft is one of the proposed advantages of remnant-preserving reconstruction. The aim of this review is to summarize advances in the basic science underpinning this function, alongside recent clinical studies, to define the current role for remnant-preservation.A comprehensive systematic review was performed using PubMed and Medline searches. Studies were analyzed with particular focus placed on the methodology used to either identify mechanoreceptors or test proprioception.Contemporary work, using immunohistological staining, has shown mechanoreceptors primarily within proximity to the bony attachments of the ACL (peripherally in the subsynovial layer). The number of these receptors has been shown to decrease rapidly, following rupture, with adhesion to the posterior cruciate ligament slowing this decline. Recent studies have shown proprioceptive deficits, in both the injured and contralateral knees, with the clinical relevance of findings limited by testing methodology and the small differences found. The advantages of remnant-preservation, seen primarily in animal studies, have not been shown in systematic reviews or meta-analysis of clinical studies.The potential for reinnervation of the graft is likely time-dependent and reliant on continued loading of the remnant. Therefore, current clinical use and future research should focus on preserving remnants within 6 months of injury that remain loaded by adherence to the posterior cruciate ligament. Subsequent testing should account for central neurological changes and focus on clinically relevant outcomes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although mixed infection by two Plasmodium species has been recognized, mixed infection by three different Plasmodium species within one individual has not been clarified. This study sought to determine the pooled prevalence and proportion of triple mixed Plasmodium spp. infection compared with double mixed infection. METHODS: Articles from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for cross-sectional studies of triple mixed infection by Plasmodium species and then were retrieved and extracted. The pooled proportion and prevalence of triple mixed infection by Plasmodium species were subjected to random-effects analysis. The secondary outcomes were differences in the pooled proportion between triple mixed infection and double mixed infection by Plasmodium species reported in the included studies. RESULTS: Of 5621 identified studies, triple mixed infection data were available for 35 records, including 601 patients from 22 countries. The overall pooled prevalence of triple mixed infection was 4\% (95\% Confidence Interval (CI) 3-5\%; I(2) = 92.5\%). The pooled proportion of triple mixed infection compared with double mixed infection was 12\% (95\% CI 9-18; I(2) = 91\%). Most of the included studies (29/35; 82.9\%) presented a lower proportion of triple mixed infection than double mixed infection. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the proportion of triple mixed infection was the highest in Oceania (23\%; 95\% CI 15-36\%) and Europe (21\%; 95\% CI 5-86\%), but the lowest in the USA (3\%; 95\% CI 2-4\%). Moreover, the proportion of triple mixed infection was higher in residents (20\%; 95\% CI 14-29\%) than in febrile patients (7\%; 95\% CI 4-13\%), when compared with the proportion of double mixed infection. Subgroup analysis of the age groups demonstrated that, compared with the proportion of double mixed infection, triple mixed infection was lower in patients aged ≤ 5 years (OR = 0.27; 95\% CI 0.13-0.56; I(2) = 31\%) and {\textgreater} 5 years (OR = 0.09; 95\% CI 0.04-0.25, I(2) = 78\%). CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggested that, in areas where triple mixed infection were endemic, PCR or molecular diagnosis for all residents in communities where malaria is submicroscopic can provide prevalence data and intervention measures, as well as prevent disease transmission and enhance malaria elimination efforts.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Plasmodium cynomolgi is a simian malaria parasite that has been reported as a naturally acquired human infection. The present study aims to systematically review reports on naturally acquired P. cynomolgi in humans, mosquitoes, and macaques to provide relevant data for pre-emptive surveillance and preparation in the event of an outbreak of zoonotic malaria in Southeast Asia. METHODS: The protocol of the systematic review was registered at PROSPERO with approval ID CRD42020203046. Three databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and MEDLINE) were searched for studies reporting the prevalence of P. cynomolgi infections in Southeast Asian countries between 1946 and 2020. The pooled prevalence or pooled proportion of P. cynomolgi parasitemia in humans, mosquitoes, and macaques was estimated using a random-effects model. Differences in the clinical characteristics of P. cynomolgi infections were also estimated using a random-effects model and presented as pooled odds ratios (ORs) or mean differences (MDs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Thirteen studies reporting on the prevalence of naturally acquired P. cynomolgi in humans (3 studies, 21 cases), mosquitoes (3 studies, 28 cases), and macaques (7 studies, 334 cases) were included. The results demonstrated that the pooled proportion of naturally acquired P. cynomolgi in humans was 1\% (95\% CI, 0.1\%, I(2), 0\%), while the pooled proportion of P. cynomolgi infecting mosquitoes was 18\% (95\% CI, 10-26\%, I(2), 32.7\%). The pooled prevalence of naturally acquired P. cynomolgi in macaques was 47\% (95\% CI, 27-67\%, I(2), 98.3\%). Most of the cases of naturally acquired P. cynomolgi in humans were reported in Cambodia (62\%) and Malaysia (38\%), while cases of P. cynomolgi in macaques were reported in Malaysia (35.4\%), Singapore (23.2\%), Indonesia (17.3\%), Philippines (8.5\%), Laos (7.93\%), and Cambodia (7.65\%). Cases of P. cynomolgi in mosquitoes were reported in Vietnam (76.9\%) and Malaysia (23.1\%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the occurrence of naturally acquired P. cynomolgi infection in humans, mosquitoes, and macaques. Further studies of P. cynomolgi in asymptomatic human cases in areas where vectors and natural hosts are endemic are extensively needed if human infections with P. cynomolgi do become public health problems.},

Study 1 revealed no relevant clinical studies on EAP with a psychodynamic background with an adult population. Study 2 revealed 12 publications to review predominantly addressing veterans with PTSD. The methodological limitations of most of the studies restrain the overall findings on outcome. However, overall positive effects for EAP, specifically on its experiential features and on finding interpersonal trust for patients, can be discerned.

For healthcare, the topic is both concerning and tragically ironic as hospitals have substantial environmental footprints, which are now known to contribute to significant health problems that the system itself was designed to treat. The human medical field has been proactive in taking steps to reduce waste and carbon emissions by identifying best practices to minimize such impacts. Characterization of needs and gaps has been addressed through reviews of the literature regarding environmental sustainability in the context of human hospitals. Our objective was to replicate methods used in a recent review of environmental sustainability in human hospitals to summarize information available to clinical veterinarians. Two search algorithms were used across eight databases, however only three peer-reviewed opinion articles specific to veterinary medicine were identified. These papers included one on anesthesia and two on production animals. Interestingly, all articles were written by United Kingdom-based authors and none were specific to companion animal practice, the largest sector in the veterinary industry in the United States. Results of this review highlight need for research and communication that supports veterinary clinics in adopting more environmentally sustainable practices. Proposed starting points informed from research in other sectors, including five physical themes of energy efficiency, water, waste, sustainable procurement, and transportation, and human behavior changes on the individual, group, and organizational levels, are discussed. Additional work is needed to support veterinarians and other animal health professionals to practice medicine in a way that upholds the veterinary profession's oath to promote the health of animals, the public, and the environment we all share.},

PURPOSE: To perform a systematic review of basic science and animal studies to determine the effect of doxycycline treatment on the prevention of PTOA after ACL rupture/transection. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: A systematic review was performed by searching the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases to identify basic science and animal studies evaluating the effect of doxycycline treatment on the prevention of PTOA of the knee joint after ACL/cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) injury. The search phrase used was "doxycycline cruciate ligament." Inclusion criteria were basic science and animal studies evaluating the effect of oral administration of doxycycline in ACL/CCL-deficient animals with or without a control group. RESULTS: Seven studies met inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. Five studies were performed in dogs, 1 in rabbits, and 1 in mice. Overall, the effects of doxycycline treatment on the prevention of PTOA after ACL/CCL rupture/transection were mixed. In dogs, no significant effects of doxycycline treatment were found in terms of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, while a mouse study found significantly lower MMP-13 expression on the tibia in doxycycline-treated animals, suggesting that doxycycline may protect against proteoglycan loss and decrease osteoarthritis progression. Cartilage nitric oxide concentrations were lower in doxycycline-treated dogs compared with untreated dogs, suggesting decreased cartilage degradation among doxycycline-treated dogs, although there were no significant effects on cartilage stromelysin levels with no significant effects in terms of physiological remodeling or catabolism of cartilage. Bone formation or resorption was not found to be affected by doxycycline treatment. One study demonstrated a substantial beneficial effect of doxycycline on gross morphology of the medial femoral condyle. Doxycycline was found to conserve bone strain energy density and appeared to limit subchondral bone loss in 1 study. CONCLUSION: Based on the limited available animal studies, doxycycline appears to demonstrate some benefits in the prevention of PTOA after ACL/CCL rupture/transection. Additional studies are needed to further characterize the potential benefits, side effects, dosage, and duration of this treatment after ACL injury in human patients.},

As expanding human populations across Panthera range countries exacerbate competition for land and prey, conflicts between humans and big cats are inevitable. Through a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature published from 1991 to 2014 and indexed in Web of Science and Google Scholar (186 articles), our study explored the current state of knowledge regarding human-Panthera conflict and potential solutions, examining variables such as spatial and temporal distribution of research, methods used to study conflict, evaluation of interventions, and management recommendations. Our synthesis revealed several key data gaps and research needs. More studies could utilize diverse data collection approaches to focus on both the ecological and socio-cultural context for conflict. Additionally, only 21\% of articles included in the review evaluated conflict mitigation interventions, and few of these yielded conclusive results. Success ratios suggest that compensation schemes and livestock management strategies were more effective tools for addressing conflict than either direct interventions (lethal removal or translocation of animals) or community interventions (e.g. education, ecotourism, local management). More studies should systematically evaluate the efficacy of conflict mitigation strategies, many of which are consistently recommended without empirical support. Results highlight trends and opportunities that can be used to inform future research and management efforts focused on human-Panthera conflict, ultimately enhancing the potential for coexistence between humans and carnivore species worldwide.},

	abstract = {Lentiviral replication mediated by reverse transcriptase is considered to be highly error prone, leading to a high intra-individual evolution rate that promotes evasion of neutralization and persistent infection. Understanding lentiviral intra-individual evolutionary dynamics on a comparative basis can therefore inform research strategies to aid in studies of pathogenesis, vaccine design, and therapeutic intervention. We conducted a systematic review of intra-individual evolution rates for three species groups of lentiviruses-feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Overall, intra-individual rate estimates differed by virus but not by host, gene, or viral strain. Lentiviral infections in spillover (nonadapted) hosts approximated infections in primary (adapted) hosts. Our review consistently documents that FIV evolution rates within individuals are significantly lower than the rates recorded for HIV and SIV. FIV intra-individual evolution rates were noted to be equivalent to FIV interindividual rates. These findings document inherent differences in the evolution of FIV relative to that of primate lentiviruses, which may signal intrinsic difference of reverse transcriptase between these viral species or different host-viral interactions. Analysis of lentiviral evolutionary selection pressures at the individual versus population level is valuable for understanding transmission dynamics and the emergence of virulent and avirulent strains and provides novel insight for approaches to interrupt lentiviral infections.IMPORTANCE To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that compares intra-individual evolution rates for FIV, SIV, and HIV following systematic review of the literature. Our findings have important implications for informing research strategies in the field of intra-individual virus dynamics for lentiviruses. We observed that FIV evolves more slowly than HIV and SIV at the intra-individual level and found that mutation rates may differ by gene sequence length but not by host, gene, strain, an experimental setting relative to a natural setting, or spillover host infection relative to primary host infection.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dog ownership has been associated with decreased cardiovascular risk. Recent reports have suggested an association of dog companionship with lower blood pressure levels, improved lipid profile, and diminished sympathetic responses to stress. However, it is unclear if dog ownership is associated with improved survival as previous studies have yielded inconsistent results. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association of dog ownership with all-cause mortality, with and without prior cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: Studies published between 1950 and May 24, 2019 were identified by searching Embase and PubMed. Observational studies that evaluated baseline dog ownership and subsequent all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality. Two independent reviewers extracted the data. We assessed pooled data using random-effects model. A possible limitation was that the analyses were not adjusted for confounders. Ten studies were included yielding data from 3 837 005 participants (530 515 events; mean follow-up 10.1 years). Dog ownership was associated with a 24\% risk reduction for all-cause mortality as compared to nonownership (relative risk, 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.67-0.86) with 6 studies demonstrating significant reduction in the risk of death. Notably, in individuals with prior coronary events, living in a home with a dog was associated with an even more pronounced risk reduction for all-cause mortality (relative risk, 0.35; 95\% CI, 0.17-0.69; I(2), 0\%). Moreover, when we restricted the analyses to studies evaluating cardiovascular mortality, dog ownership conferred a 31\% risk reduction for cardiovascular death (relative risk, 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.67-0.71; I(2), 5.1\%). CONCLUSIONS: Dog ownership is associated with lower risk of death over the long term, which is possibly driven by a reduction in cardiovascular mortality.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The present review sought to evaluate whether - and to what extent - targeting owners' behaviour is an effective way to reduce the problem of overweight and obesity among companion dogs. METHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases identified 14 studies that evaluated the effect of an intervention targeting owners' behaviour on (i) the owner's behaviour or (ii) the weight, (iii) body fat, or (iv) body condition of the dog. We coded aspects of the study design (e.g., the outcome variable), intervention (e.g., use of theory, specific behaviour change techniques or BCTs, inclusion of nutritional intervention alongside the behavioural intervention), and sample (e.g., age, gender, and weight of the dogs at baseline) that could influence the effect sizes. RESULTS: The interventions had, on average, a medium sized effect on outcomes (d(+) = 0.59, 95\% CI: 0.23 to 0.96, k = 14, N = 384). The effect sizes from the primary studies were relatively homogenous, Q(13) = 12.10, p =  .52 and the nature of the intervention, methodological and sample characteristics did not moderate the effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The findings of the review suggest that targeting owners' behaviour can be an effective way to reduce overweight and obesity among companion dogs. However, this conclusion is based on a limited number of studies and so we hope that the present findings serve as the impetus for further research in this area.},

Low-quality studies are at risk of biased results and effect overestimation, as has been intensely discussed for small animal stroke research. However, little is known about the methodological rigor and quality in large animal stroke models, which are becoming more frequently used in the field. Based on research in two databases, this systematic review surveys and analyses the methodological quality in large animal stroke research. Quality analysis was based on the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable and the Animals in Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments guidelines. Our analysis revealed that large animal models are utilized with similar shortcomings as small animal models. Moreover, translational benefits of large animal models may be limited due to lacking implementation of important quality criteria such as randomization, allocation concealment, and blinded assessment of outcome. On the other hand, an increase of study quality over time and a positive correlation between study quality and journal impact factor were identified. Based on the obtained findings, we derive recommendations for optimal study planning, conducting, and data analysis/reporting when using large animal stroke models to fully benefit from the translational advantages offered by these models.},

Based on systematic review of studies on Anaplasma species from India [35] and World [66] from 1988 to 2017 and 1978-2017, respectively, using online databases and offline literatures, meta-analysis using meta package in R-Software was done. Prevalence of Anaplasma species in India and World were 11\% [95\% level, Confidence Interval[CI] 7-16\%, Prediction Interval[PI] 1-69\%] and 39\% [95\% level, CI 30-49\%, PI 2-95\%], and these were obtained using 31,117 and 46,365 samples, respectively. Period-wise analysis revealed high Anaplasma species prevalence before 2011 for India and the World than from 2011 through 2017. Zone-wise prevalence indicated high prevalence in Central zone [61\%] and low in West and South zones [6\%] in India, and continent-wise, it was high in South America [82\%]. The studies used methods including blood smear examination, serology and nucleic acid-based techniques and revealed high prevalence in serology for India [34\%] and World [46\%], low prevalence by blood smear for India [7\%] and World [21\%], but higher sensitivity using nucleic acid-based techniques. Species-wise indicated higher prevalence in cattle [12\%] than buffaloes [2\%] in India. Prevalence was lower in India compared to the World and higher in South America. Overall, anaplasmosis causes low productivity in dairy animals and economic loss to dairy farmers. Hence, there is a need to control Anaplasma infections in high risk areas by adopting effective therapeutic and preventive measures so as to improve the economic benefits in dairy farming.},

We identified and reviewed 24 studies related to fish consumption and the effect on cardiovascular outcomes. The study population included a total of 714,526 individuals and multiple cohorts from several countries. We found that nonfried fish consumption is probably associated with a reduced risk of overall cardiovascular disease events and myocardial infarction risk. In contrast, fried fish consumption is probably associated with an increased risk of overall cardiovascular disease events and myocardial infarction risk. No studies to date have shown any significant association between fish consumption and stroke.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal perfusion is a promising new technique for prolonged preservation of free flaps and extremities; however, uncertainties on perfusion settings and efficacy still exist. No overview of literature is currently available. This review systematically appraised available evidence comparing extracorporeal perfusion to static storage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic systematic search was performed on June 12, 2016, in MEDLINE and EMBASE. Articles were included when evaluating the effect of extracorporeal perfusion of free flaps or extremities compared to that of a control group. Two independent researchers conducted the selection process, critical appraisal, and data extraction. RESULTS: Of 3485 articles screened, 18 articles were included for further analyzation. One article studied discarded human tissue; others were studies conducted on rats, pigs, or dogs. Perfusion periods varied from 1 h to 10 d; eight articles also described replantation. Risk of bias was generally scored high; none of the articles was excluded based on these scores. Tissue vitality showed overall better results in the perfused groups, more pronounced when perfusing over 6 h. The development of edema was a broadly described side effect of perfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Although tissue vitality outcomes seem to favor extracorporeal perfusion, this is difficult to objectify because of large heterogeneity and poor quality of the available evidence. Future research should focus on validating outcome measures, edema prevention, perfusion settings, and maximum perfusion time for safe replantation and be preferably performed on large animals to increase translation to clinical settings.},

Leveraging health information technology (HIT) may augment surveillance efforts for Chagas disease (CD), given its ability to disseminate information through health information exchanges (HIE) and geographical information systems (GISs). This systematic review seeks to determine whether technological tracking of Trypanosoma cruzi-infected domestic and/or sylvatic animals as sentinels can serve as a potential surveillance resource to manage CD in the southern United States. A Boolean search string was used in PubMed and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Relevance of results was established and analysis of articles was performed by multiple reviewers. The overall Cohen statistic was 0.73, demonstrating moderate agreement among the study team. Four major themes were derived for this systematic review (n = 41): animals act as reservoir hosts to perpetuate CD, transmission to humans could be dependent on cohabitation proximity, variations in T. cruzi genotypes could lead to different clinical manifestations, and leveraging technology to track T. cruzi in domestic animals could reveal prevalent areas or "danger zones." Overall, our systematic review identified that HIT can serve as a surveillance tool to manage CD. Health information technology can serve as a surveillance tool to manage CD. This can be accomplished by tracking domestic and/or sylvatic animals as sentinels within a GIS. Information can be disseminated through HIE for use by clinicians and public health officials to reach at-risk populations.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Food-derived bioactive peptides may influence important physiological functions. An important example is beta-casomorphins, which are opioid peptides derived from A1 beta-casein in bovine milk and have been associated to be risk factors for non-communicable diseases in humans. A1 and A2 beta-casein are different with respect to the release of bioactive peptides, in particular BCM-7. However, evidence from human studies is limited and could be complemented with evidence derived from animal studies. We conducted a scoping review to identify animal studies investigating the effects of A1 beta-casein or BCM-7 compared to A2 beta-casein or any other intervention on health-related outcomes. METHODS: We systematically searched for relevant studies in two electronic databases (Medline, Embase; last search performed March 2020). Two reviewers independently undertook study selection and data extraction of included references. Results were summarized tabularly and narratively. RESULTS: We included 42 studies investigating various animal models, including rats, mice, rabbits, and dogs. Six studies investigated health-related outcomes of A1- vs. A2 milk, while most studies (n = 36) reported on physiological properties (e.g., analgesic effect) of BCM-7 as an opioid peptide. Included studies were extremely heterogeneous in terms of the study population, type of intervention and dose, and type of outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: Only a few studies comparing the effects of A1- and A2 milk were identified. More studies addressing this research question in animal models are needed to provide essential information to inform research gaps. Results from future studies could eventually complement research for humans, particularly when the body of evidence remains uncertain as is the case in the A1- and A2 milk debate.},

It is not precisely known how they exert positive effects on health outcomes. Experimental studies in animal models might reveal more about the pathophysiological mechanisms of music interventions. Methods: We performed a systematic review of experimental research in rodents. The electronic databases EMBASE, Medline(ovidSP), Web-Of-Science, PsycINFO, Cinahl, PubMed publisher, Cochrane, and Google scholar were searched for publications between January 1st 1960 and April 22nd 2017. Eligible were English-written, full-text publications on experimental research in rodents comparing music vs. a control situation. Outcomes were categorized in four domains: brain structure and neuro-chemistry; behavior; immunology; and physiology. Additionally, an overview was generated representing the effects of various types of music on outcomes. Bias in studies was assessed with the SYRCLE Risk of Bias tool. A meta-analysis was not feasible due to heterogeneous outcomes and lack of original outcome data. Results: Forty-two studies were included. Music-exposed rodents showed statistically significant increases in neuro-chemistry, such as higher BDNF levels, as well as an enhanced propensity for neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. Furthermore, music exposure was linked with statistically significantly improved spatial and auditory learning, reduced anxiety-related behavior, and increased immune responses. Various statistically significant changes occurred in physiological parameters such as blood pressure and (para)sympathetic nerve activity following music interventions. The majority of studies investigated classical music interventions, but other types of music exerted positive effects on outcomes as well. The SYRCLE risk of bias assessment revealed unclear risk of bias in all studies. Conclusions: Music interventions seem to improve brain structure and neuro-chemistry; behavior; immunology; and physiology in rodents. Further research is necessary to explore and optimize the effect of music interventions, and to evaluate its effects in humans.},

Six studies measured bone density or bone trabeculae percentage, while remaining studies measured secondary outcome measures such as osteogenesis markers, patient's self-reported pain scores, and clinical epithelial regeneration. No side effects of photobiomodulation have been reported. Higher concentration of osteogenesis markers Ocn and Runx2 were consistently reported across studies, as well as higher percentage of bony trabeculae and bone density. Within the limitations of this review, improvement in bone repair can be found when using photobiomodulation in extraction sockets.},

	abstract = {Epilepsy is a serious neurological disorder affecting around 70 million people globally and is characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures. Recent evidence indicates that dysfunction in metabolic processes can lead to the alteration of neuronal and network excitability, thereby contributing to epileptogenesis. Developing a suitable animal model that can recapitulate all the clinical phenotypes of human metabolic epilepsy (ME) is crucial yet challenging. The specific environment of many symptoms as well as the primary state of the applicable neurobiology, genetics, and lack of valid biomarkers/diagnostic tests are the key factors that hinder the process of developing a suitable animal model. The present systematic review summarizes the current state of available animal models of metabolic dysfunction associated with epileptic disorders. A systematic search was performed by using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) model. A range of electronic databases, including google scholar, Springer, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, were scanned between January 2000 and April 2020. Based on the selection criteria, 23 eligible articles were chosen and are discussed in the current review. Critical analysis of the selected literature delineated several available approaches that have been modeled into metabolic epilepsy and pointed out several drawbacks associated with the currently available models. The result describes available models of metabolic dysfunction associated with epileptic disorder, such as mitochondrial respiration deficits, Lafora disease (LD) model-altered glycogen metabolism, causing epilepsy, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) deficiency, adiponectin responsive seizures, phospholipid dysfunction, glutaric aciduria, mitochondrial disorders, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) α-subunit gene (PDHA1), pyridoxine dependent epilepsy (PDE), BCL2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD), Kcna1 knock out (KO), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) cancer susceptibility candidate 2 (lncRNA CASC2). Finally, the review highlights certain focus areas that may increase the possibilities of developing more suitable animal models and underscores the importance of the rationalization of animal models and evaluation methods for studying ME. The review also suggests the pressing need of developing precise robust animal models and evaluation methods for investigating ME.},

Systematic search from PubMed, Google Scholar and J-Gate Plus was carried out and 24 eligible articles from 2013-2019 in India were retrieved. The R Open source Scripting software was used to perform statistical analysis. The overall prevalence of ESBLs among animals in India was 9\%. The pooled prevalence of ESBLs in animals were 26, 11, 6 and 8\% for north, east, south and central zones, respectively. The reported prevalence of ESBLs in animals were 12, 5, 8, 8, 12, 13 and 33\% were reported for the years 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 respectively. The species-wise stratified results showed a predominance of ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (11\%) when compared to Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spp. which were 7\% and 5\%, respectively. The prevalence data generated could be utilized in infection control and in antibiotic use management decisions for developing appropriate intervention strategies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the pathology and pathogenesis of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) in rodents. BACKGROUND: Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw occurs in patients taking antiresorptive drugs, such as bisphosphonates and denosumab, and anti-angiogenesis agents. However, there is limited information about the pathology of MRONJ at the clinical level. Moreover, no information about the exact mechanisms of MRONJ is clinically available. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PubMed, SCOPUS and Medline databases were used to search for relevant articles up to April 2018 by two independent reviewers. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. RESULTS: Of the 1841 studies, 10 articles met the eligibility criteria. The most commonly observed pathology of MRONJ-like lesions was exposed bone without epithelial coverage, decreases in the number of osteocytes and increases in necrotic bone with more empty lacunae. No definitive pathogenesis of MRONJ-like lesions was found. Both zoledronic acid (ZA) monotherapy and ZA/chemotherapeutic and/or dexamethasone combination therapy were significant high-risk factors for developing MRONJ-like lesions (P {\textless} 0.00001 and P {\textless} 0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Based on rodent studies, common pathological findings were extracted in bisphosphonate-related ONJ (BRONJ)-like lesions, whereas no definitive pathogenesis was identified. There is no information about the pathology and pathogenesis of denosumab-related ONJ. These findings clearly suggest that accumulation of scientific evidence based on animal studies is absolutely necessary to explore the pathology and pathogenesis of MRONJ in humans. ZA administration would be a significant risk factor for developing BRONJ-like lesions.},

These BPEs include electrical stimulation (ES), pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF), extracorporeal shockwave (ECSW), photo energies and ultrasound (US). Databases searched included CINAHL, MEDLINE and PubMed from 1966 to 2018. Studies reviewed include animal and cell studies on treatment with BPEs compared with sham, control or other BPEs. Information regarding the objective measures of tissue healing and data was extracted. Eighty-two studies were eventually selected for the critical appraisal: five on PEMF, four each on ES and ECSW, sixty-six for photo energies, and three about US. Based on the percentage of original wound size affected by the BPEs, both PEMF and low-level laser therapy (LLL) demonstrated a significant clinical benefit compared to the control or sham treatment, whereas the effect of US did not reveal a significance. Our results indicate potential benefits of selected BPEs in diabetic wound management. However, due to the heterogeneity of the current clinical trials, comprehensive studies using well-designed trials are warranted to confirm the results.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12910-020-00465-7},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The burgeoning field of biomedical research involving the mixture of human and animal materials has attracted significant ethical controversy. Due to the many dimensions of potential ethical conflict involved in this type of research, and the wide variety of research projects under discussion, it is difficult to obtain an overview of the ethical debate. This paper attempts to remedy this by providing a systematic review of ethical reasons in academic publications on human-animal chimera research. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the ethical literature concerning human-animal chimeras based on the research question: "What ethical reasons have been given for or against conducting human-animal chimera research, and how have these reasons been treated in the ongoing debate?" Our search extends until the end of the year 2017, including MEDLINE, Embase, PhilPapers and EthxWeb databases, restricted to peer-reviewed journal publications in English. Papers containing ethical reasons were analyzed, and the reasons were coded according to whether they were endorsed, mentioned or rejected. RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-one articles were retrieved by our search, and 88 were ultimately included and analyzed. Within these articles, we found 464 passages containing reasons for and against conducting human-animal chimera research. We classified these reasons into five categories and, within these, identified 12 broad and 31 narrow reason types. 15\% of the retrieved passages contained reasons in favor of conducting chimera research (Category P), while 85\% of the passages contained reasons against it. The reasons against conducting chimera research fell into four further categories: reasons concerning the creation of a chimera (Category A), its treatment (Category B), reasons referring to metaphysical or social issues resulting from its existence (Category C) and to potential downstream effects of chimera research (Category D). A significant proportion of identified passages (46\%) fell under Category C. CONCLUSIONS: We hope that our results, in revealing the conceptual and argumentative structure of the debate and highlighting some its most notable tendencies and prominent positions, will facilitate continued discussion and provide a basis for the development of relevant policy and legislation.},

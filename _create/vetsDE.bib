	abstract = {Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) vaccination is globally one of the most commonly used intervention strategies in growing pigs since several products became commercially available in 2006. While multiple trials have described the efficacy of individual PCV2 vaccines relative to non-vaccination, few studies provide product-to-product comparisons of efficacy. Given the well-documented efficacy of PCV2 vaccines, information about the comparative efficacy of available vaccines is more relevant to producers and veterinarians than comparison to non-vaccination. The objective of this study was to provide comparative estimates of changes in average daily gain effect associated with the use of the commercially available PCV2 vaccines. PubMed, CAB Abstracts, AGRICOLA, the USA Department of Agriculture Center for Veterinary Biologics database of licenses and provisions, and the proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the American Association of Swine Veterinarians, the Allen D. Leman Swine Conference, the Iowa State University Swine Disease Conference for Swine Practitioners, and the International Pig Veterinary Society Congress were used as the sources of information. Trials of licensed PCV2 vaccines administered according to manufacturers' specifications to intensively raised piglets with a known herd porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) status were considered relevant to the meta-analysis. Relevant studies had to report average daily gain (ADG) from weaning to finish and PCV2 infection had to be naturally occurring.},

It is based on methodological articulation that included: a) systematic review of the reference literature on the research topic; b) analysis of related legislation (veterinary products and pesticides); c) risk identification regarding the use of veterinary products formulated using active ingredients listed as pesticides; d) and risk perception analysis of a group of dairy production workers. Results indicate a situation of particular interest to Public Health. Regarding dairy production workers, the invisibility of risks associated with handling pesticides for veterinary use, increases their exposure and is related to several health problems, especially for women. This same invisibility leads to a neglect of the prohibition period between pesticide use and consumption of other products. Part of the problem may be associated with the non-classification of pesticides for veterinary use as 'pesticides' (they are classified as veterinary products), which highlights the importance and the urgency of discussion of the theme.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human rabies remains a significant problem in many developing countries, where canine rabies is the most common means of transmission. Although vaccination of dogs has been shown to be the most effective method of prevention in humans, dog vaccination is often lacking. METHODS: This systematic review examined dog rabies vaccination coverage achieved following mass vaccination campaigns and dog ecology/management factors relevant to rabies control in the developing world. We searched a variety of electronic databases for published articles pertaining to dog rabies vaccination or dog ecology where data were collected utilizing a household cluster survey. We reviewed studies published between January 1, 1980 and present and identified 29 articles for inclusion. RESULTS: We found the majority of vaccination campaigns were able to achieve the WHO recommended vaccination coverage of {\textgreater}/= 70\% and calculated weighted mean post-campaign vaccination coverage of 76.5\% in urban areas and 73.7\% in rural areas. However, we found an absence of studies related to dog vaccination/dog ecology from countries with the greatest burden of rabies such as India, China, and Pakistan. In addition, the majority of dogs in the developing world are very young and short-lived, reducing the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies on canine ecology should be undertaken in countries with high endemic canine rabies. New methods for improving the longevity of dogs and reducing high dog population turnover need to be investigated. Programs which encourage good dog management and promote responsible pet ownership are essential to eliminating canine and human rabies.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic and critical appraisal of the quality of previous publications and describe diagnostic methods, diagnostic criteria and definitions, repeatability, and agreement among methods for diagnosis of vaginitis, cervicitis, endometritis, salpingitis, and oophoritis in dairy cows. Publications (n = 1,600) that included the words "dairy," "cows," and at least one disease of interest were located with online search engines. In total, 51 papers were selected for comprehensive review by pairs of the authors. Only 61\% (n = 31) of the 51 reviewed papers provided a definition or citation for the disease or diagnostic methods studied, and only 49\% (n = 25) of the papers provided the data or a citation to support the test cut point used for diagnosing disease. Furthermore, a large proportion of the papers did not provide sufficient detail to allow critical assessment of the quality of design or reporting. Of 11 described diagnostic methods, only one complete methodology, i.e., vaginoscopy, was assessed for both within- and between-operator repeatability (kappa = 0.55-0.60 and 0.44, respectively). In the absence of a gold standard, comparisons between different tests have been undertaken. Agreement between the various diagnostic methods is at a low level. These discrepancies may indicate that these diagnostic methods assess different aspects of reproductive health and underline the importance of tying diagnostic criteria to objective measures of reproductive performance. Those studies that used a reproductive outcome to select cut points and tests have the greatest clinical utility. This approach has demonstrated, for example, that presence of (muco)purulent discharge in the vagina and an increased proportion of leukocytes in cytological preparations following uterine lavage or cytobrush sampling are associated with poorer reproductive outcomes. The lack of validated, consistent definitions and outcome variables makes comparisons of the different tests difficult. The quality of design and reporting in future publications could be improved by using checklists as a guideline. Further high-quality research based on published standards to improve study design and reporting should improve cow-side diagnostic tests. Specifically, more data on intra- and interobserver agreement are needed to evaluate test variability. Also, more studies are necessary to determine optimal cut points and time postpartum of examination.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically examine the evidence on activating agents and test protocols for the thrombelastography (TEG) and rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM) viscoelastic point-of-care instruments and to identify knowledge gaps. DESIGN: Ten questions were considered, the primary question addressed the use of activating agents and secondary questions addressed assay temperature, length of analysis, pipetting, sample volume, reproducibility, and quality controls. Standardized, systematic evaluation of the literature was performed. Relevant articles were categorized according to level of evidence (LOE). Consensus was developed regarding conclusions for application of concepts to clinical practice. SETTING: Academic and referral veterinary medical centers. RESULTS: PubMed and CAB abstracts were searched. Twenty papers were initially identified concerning the primary question; 16 were in support of the questions (LOE 2 Good, LOE 3 Good, LOE 5 Good, LOE 6 Good, LOE 5 Fair, LOE 6 Fair); and 4 were neutral (LOE 3 Good, LOE 6 Good, LOE Fair, LOE 5 Fair). Additional papers were evaluated post hoc during manuscript preparation. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there is a body of evidence from veterinary and human medicine that strongly suggests that TEG or ROTEM assays using citrated samples that employ an activator have significantly lower inherent variability than those that use recalcification alone. There is also strong evidence in dogs, cats, and humans that the results obtained using different activators are not directly comparable. There is no evidence to suggest that any one activating agent is superior to another for all patient populations, or drug monitoring indications. As such, use of more than one assay for complete thromboelastographic evaluation of a patient's coagulation system may be warranted. Standardization of the concentrations of activators would be beneficial.},

The aims of this systematic review were to describe and discuss the existing scientific findings on genetic susceptibility to canine leishmaniasis, as well as to show the gaps of the existing knowledge. Twelve articles were selected, including breed immunological studies, genome wide associations or other gene polymorphism or gene sequencing studies, and transcription approaches. As main results of literature, there was a suggestion of genetic clinical resistance background for Ibizan Hound dogs, and alleles associated with protection or susceptibility to visceral leishmaniasis in Boxer dogs. Genetic markers can explain phenotypic variance in both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and in cellular immune responses, including antigen presentation. Many gene segments are involved in canine visceral leishmaniasis phenotype, with Natural Resistance Associated Macrophage Protein 1 (NRAMP1) as the most studied. This was related to both protection and susceptibility. In comparison with murine and human genetic approaches, lack of knowledge in dogs is notorious, with many possibilities for new studies, revealing a wide field to be assessed on canine leishmaniasis susceptibility research.},

It is regarded as endemic in Sub-Saharan Africa; however, for most countries scarce epidemiological data, if any, exist. The primary objectives were to describe the prevalence of leptospirosis in countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, and to develop options for prevention and control in the future. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to determine the prevalence of leptospirosis in Sub-Saharan Africa; the PRISMA guidelines were followed. Medline/PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, BIOSIS Previews, the African Index Medicus, AJOL, and Google Scholar were searched. RESULTS: Information about the prevalence and incidence of leptospirosis in humans is available, but remains scarce for many countries. Data are unavailable or outdated for many countries, particularly those in Central Africa. Most data are available from animals, probably due to the economic losses caused by leptospirosis in livestock. In humans, leptospirosis is an important cause of febrile illness in Sub-Saharan Africa. It concerns numerous serogroups, harboured by many different animal carriers. DISCUSSION: A wide variety of data was identified. Prevalence rates vary throughout the continent and more research, especially in humans, is needed to reliably gauge the extent of the problem. Preventive measures need to be reconsidered to control outbreaks in the future.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper was to perform a critical review of the literature as it pertains to the current status of antimicrobial resistance in pathogens associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in beef cattle and to provide a concise yet informative narrative on the most relevant publications available. As such, the scientific literature contained in PubMed, AGRICOLA, and CAB were searched in February of 2014 for articles related to susceptibility testing of Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni from cases of BRD. Titles and abstracts were read and 105 articles that were relevant to the subject of BRD antibiotic resistance were attained for further review. After the application of exclusion criterion (publications must have originated from North America, be in English, adhere to standards set forth by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, and be concerning antimicrobial resistance in BRD in beef cattle), 16 articles remained and are the focus of this publication. Due to the disparate data from the few studies that investigate susceptibility testing of BRD pathogens, a quantitative assessment or meta-analysis was not performed on the studies presented in this review. However, considering diagnostic lab data, there appears to be a clear trend of a decrease in susceptibility of the three major BRD pathogens to the antimicrobials used commonly for treatment and control of BRD. Studies performing sensitivity testing on healthy cattle report much lower resistance, but it remains unclear if this is because of a true lack of resistance mechanisms, or if the isolates do contain quiescent genes for resistance that are only phenotypically expressed following the administration of an antimicrobial for either treatment or control of BRD. Future research to address this question of genotype and phenotypic expression before and after antimicrobial administration will further advance our knowledge in this area.},

	abstract = {Gold bead implantation/gold acupuncture is becoming increasingly used in veterinary medicine as a method of pain treatment in cases of osteoarthritic diseases. Part one of the overview dealing with the use of gold implants as a treatment of canine hip joint dysplasia (cHD) introduced the method of implanting gold in tissue and publications which investigated the subsequent effects of implantation. This article focuses on publications concerning the clinical effectiveness of gold implantation within the scope of pain therapy in cHD. Due to the study design, a classification using evidence-based levels (EbL) was carried out. Three double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised studies (EbL II) were considered together with three retrospective studies on own patients (EbL IV) and five case studies (EbL IV). While the case and retrospective studies reported impressive therapeutic success in treating cHD-incurred pain with gold implantation, a pain-reducing effect through gold implantation was only demonstrated in one of the three double-blind studies. The two remaining EbL II studies found no differences between the placebo-group and the group of dogs treated with gold implantation. In one of these two studies, kinematic and kinetic gait analyses were used for objective evaluation of the effects of the treatment. Thus, the only study that carried out an objective evaluation of the therapeutic result of gold implantation came to the conclusion that the method is ineffective. For a concluding assessment of gold implantation in the case of cHD, gait analysis studies investigating the effects of gold implantation in comparison to a standard treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are currently lacking.},

For the present article, publications from veterinary books and journals were collected and evaluated, together with related articles in human medicine. After providing an overview of the historical use of gold and gold compounds, the technique of implanting this noble metal is introduced. The reasons for establishing the terms gold acupuncture and gold (bead) implantation are described, considering the question whether and what kind of methodological differences exist behind these terms. Next, previous publications concerning the effects of gold implantation in tissue are summarised. In 2002 it was proven that gold ions are released from the surface of gold implants by a process termed dissolucytosis. Subsequent publications further investigated details about the interaction between gold ions and tissue as well as the distribution pattern of bio-released ions. Gold compounds were previously used for chrysotherapy in human medicine until medication with fewer side effects became established. The anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulatory properties of gold compounds were used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Current research aims to ascertain whether the anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulating effects of gold compounds are imitated by gold ions released from gold implants at a local level. In conclusion, the present review summarises important findings about the effects of gold implanted in tissue. However, further research is necessary to estimate the limitations and benefits of this auromedication.},

	abstract = {Salmonella contamination of laying hen flocks and shell eggs is associated with various management and environmental factors. Foodborne outbreaks of human salmonellosis have been traced back to consumption of Salmonella-contaminated shell eggs. In the present study, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify and provide an evidence-based overview of potential risk factors of Salmonella contamination of laying hens, layer premises, and shell eggs. This systematic literature search was conducted using AGRICOLA, CAB Abstracts, and PubMed databases. Observational studies that identified risk factors for Salmonella contamination of layer flocks and shell eggs were selected, and best evidence was synthesized to summarize the results. Altogether, 13 cross-sectional studies and four longitudinal studies published in English were included in the review. Evidence scores were assigned based on the study design and quality of the study to grade the evidence level. The strength of association of a risk factor was determined according to the odds ratios. In this systematic review, the presence of previous Salmonella infection, absence of cleaning and disinfection, presence of rodents, induced molting, larger flock size ({\textgreater}30,000 hens), multiage management, cage housing systems, in-line egg processing, rearing pullets on the floor, pests with access to feed prior to movement to the feed trough, visitors allowed in the layer houses, and trucks near farms and air inlets were identified as the risk factors associated with Salmonella contamination of laying hen premises, whereas high level of manure contamination, middle and late phase of production, high degree of egg-handling equipment contamination, flock size of {\textgreater}30,000, and egg production rate of {\textgreater}96\% were identified as the risk factors associated with Salmonella contamination of shell eggs. These risk factors demonstrated strong to moderate evidence of association with Salmonella contamination of laying hens and shell eggs. Eggshells testing positive for Salmonella were 59 times higher when fecal samples were positive and nine times higher when floor dust samples were positive. Risk factors associated with Salmonella Enteritidis infection in laying hens were flock size, housing system, and farms with hens of different ages. As a summary, this systematic review demonstrated that Salmonella contamination of laying hen flocks and shell eggs in layer production systems is multifactorial. This study provides a knowledge base for the implementation of targeted intervention strategies to control Salmonella contamination of laying hen flocks and shell eggs.},

Fourteen challenge trials described the efficacy of different antibiotics after challenge with S. Typhimurium. The studies identified were of limited evidentiary value for the review question because they were not relevant to the review question, i.e. conducted in artificial settings on small numbers of young pigs. None of the studies reported using blinding during outcome assessment. No antibiotic regimen was evaluated more than once. The association between sub-therapeutic antibiotics and Salmonella outcomes in market-weight swine raised in modern production systems cannot be summarized using the currently available literature.

	abstract = {A systematic review was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of vaccination to reduce Salmonella prevalence in market weight finisher swine. A search of online databases and selected conference proceedings was conducted to identify relevant studies. The review process followed relevance screening, methodological quality assessment, and data extraction. Although multiple outcomes were frequently reported, only outcomes describing culture of Salmonella were extracted. Five clinical trials and 23 challenge studies were considered likely relevant to the review as they described vaccination to reduce Salmonella in swine. Five clinical trials reported vaccination was associated with reduced isolation of Salmonella in market weight pigs, however, information required to assess the internal validity of the study was often not described in the manuscripts. All challenge studies assessed vaccine efficacy in pigs aged {\textless}15 weeks reducing the relevance of results to the review which focused on market weight pigs. Only five of the 23 challenge studies reported the majority of information necessary to evaluate the quality of vaccine studies. Given large variability in population type, sample size, type of vaccine, dose and dosing regimens, and type of outcomes observed, pooled data analysis was not possible, and therefore, a qualitative synthesis of the studies was conducted. Available evidence suggests that vaccination is associated with reduced Salmonella prevalence in swine at or near harvest; however, this conclusion is based on studies with design and reporting deficiencies that could potentially indicate biases with the outcome.},

	doi = {10.1002/ece3.3287},
	abstract = {Livestock grazing affects over 60\% of the world's agricultural lands and can influence rangeland ecosystem services and the quantity and quality of wildlife habitat, resulting in changes in biodiversity. Concomitantly, livestock grazing has the potential to be detrimental to some wildlife species while benefiting other rangeland organisms. Many imperiled grouse species require rangeland landscapes that exhibit diverse vegetation structure and composition to complete their life cycle. However, because of declining populations and reduced distributions, grouse are increasingly becoming a worldwide conservation concern. Grouse, as a suite of upland gamebirds, are often considered an umbrella species for other wildlife and thus used as indicators of rangeland health. With a projected increase in demand for livestock products, better information will be required to mitigate the anthropogenic effects of livestock grazing on rangeland biodiversity. To address this need, we completed a data-driven and systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature to determine the current knowledge of the effects of livestock grazing on grouse populations (i.e., chick production and population indices) worldwide. Our meta-analysis revealed an overall negative effect of livestock grazing on grouse populations. Perhaps more importantly, we identified an information void regarding the effects of livestock grazing on the majority of grouse species. Additionally, the reported indirect effects of livestock grazing on grouse species were inconclusive and more reflective of differences in the experimental design of the available studies. Future studies designed to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of livestock grazing on wildlife should document (i) livestock type, (ii) timing and frequency of grazing, (iii) duration, and (iv) stocking rate. Much of this information was lacking in the available published studies we reviewed, but is essential when making comparisons between different livestock grazing management practices and their potential impacts on rangeland biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), due to infection with serotype O virus, occurred in wild boar and within eleven outbreaks in domestic livestock in the south-east of Bulgaria, Thrace region, in 2011. Hence, the issue of the potential for the spread and maintenance of FMD virus (FMDV) infection in a population of wild ungulates became important. This assessment focused on the spread and maintenance of FMDV infection within a hypothetical wild boar and deer population in an environment, which is characterized by a climate transitional between Mediterranean and continental and variable wildlife population densities. The assessment was based on three aspects: (i) a systematic review of the literature focusing on experimental infection studies to identify the parameters describing the duration of FMDV infection in deer and wild boar, as well as observational studies assessing the occurrence of FMDV infection in wild deer and wild boar populations, (ii) prevalence survey data of wild boar and deer in Bulgaria and Turkey and (iii) an epidemiological model, simulating the host-to-host spread of FMDV infections. It is concluded, based on all three aspects, that the wildlife population in Thrace, and so wildlife populations in similar ecological settings, are probably not able to maintain FMD in the long term in the absence of FMDV infection in the domestic host population. However, limited spread of FMDV infection in time and space in the wildlife populations can occur. If there is a continued cross-over of FMDV between domestic and wildlife populations or a higher population density, virus circulation may be prolonged.},

	abstract = {The minerals Cu, Mo, and S are essential for metabolic functions related to cattle health and performance. The interaction between Cu, Mo, and S can determine the utilization of each mineral, in particular Cu, by ruminants. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of dietary Cu, Mo, and S and their interactions on plasma and liver Cu, ADG, and G:F in growing-finishing cattle. Data were collated from 12 published studies. The model with the best fit to data indicated plasma Cu was positively affected by dietary Cu (P {\textless} 0.01) and negatively affected by both dietary Mo (P {\textless} 0.01) and S (P {\textless} 0.01). Another model also indicated that plasma Cu concentration is positively related to Cu:Mo ratio in the diet (P {\textless} 0.01). Dietary Cu had a positive effect on liver Cu (P {\textless} 0.01), whereas Mo showed a negative effect (P {\textless} 0.05), and no effect of dietary S on liver Cu was observed (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Average daily gain was negatively affected by dietary Mo (P {\textless} 0.05) and S (P {\textless} 0.01) and positively affected by Cu:Mo ratio (P {\textless} 0.01), likely because an increased Cu:Mo ratio minimizes the antagonistic effect of Mo on Cu. The feed conversion ratio was negatively affected by Mo (P {\textless} 0.05) and S (P {\textless} 0.01), whereas effects of the Cu:Mo ratio and dietary Cu were not significant (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The interaction between S and Mo affected (P {\textless} 0.01) G:F, which was likely related to a positive response with the proper balance between these minerals. In conclusion, dietary Cu, Mo, and S and the Cu:Mo ratio caused changes in plasma Cu. Only dietary Mo and S led to a negative response in the performance of growing-finishing cattle, whereas the diet Cu:Mo ratio has a linear and quadratic effect on ADG. Nutritionists and producers need to consider with caution the supplementation of growing-finishing cattle diets with Mo and S because of their potentially adverse effects on animal performance. An appropriate Cu:Mo ratio is desirable to minimize the effects of an impaired supply of Mo on Cu metabolism and ADG.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: IgY antibodies are serum immunoglobulin in birds, reptiles and amphibians, and are transferred from serum to egg yolk to confer passive immunity to their embryos and offspring. Currently, the oral passive immunization using chicken IgY has been focused as an alternative to antibiotics for the treatment and control of diarrhea in animals and humans. This systematic review was focused to determine the effect of IgY in controlling and preventing diarrhea in domesticated animals including Piglets, Mice, Poultry and Calves. METHODS AND RESULTS: Previous research reports focused on treatment effect of Chicken IgY against diarrhea were retrieved from different electronic data bases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPRINGER-LINK, WILEY, AGRICOLA, MEDWELL Journals, Scientific Publish, Chinese articles from Core periodicals in 2012). A total of 61 studies in 4 different animal classes met the inclusion criteria. Data on study characteristics and outcome measures were extracted. The pooled relative risk (RR) of 49 studies of different animals [Piglets – 22; Mice – 14; Poultry – 7 and Calves – 6] in meta-analyses revealed that, IgY significantly reduced the risk of diarrhea in treatment group when compare to the placebo. However, the 95\% confidence intervals of the majority of studies in animal class piglets and calves embrace RR of one. The same results were obtained in sub group analyses (treatment regiment – prophylactic or therapeutic; pathogen type – bacterial or viral). Perhaps, this inconsistency in the effect of IgY at the individual study level and overall effect measures could be influenced by the methodological heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: The present systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis demonstrated the beneficial effect of IgY. This supports the opinion that IgY is useful for prophylaxis and treatment. However, more intensive studies using the gold standard animal experiments with the focus to use IgY alone or in combination with other alternative strategies are indispensable.},

Papers selected for analysis had to provide SCC values associated with the natural infection in quarters by different bacteria. Sampling for measurement of SCC and determination of the infection had to be done on the same day. Only papers published in English or in French after 1971 were considered. Twenty-one papers fulfilled the selection criteria. The animals sampled, the measurement techniques for SCC and the bacteriological identification, as well as the definition of the infection, all differed widely among the selected studies. The meta-analysis method was used to estimate both the mean SCC (arithmetic and geometric) value and the average increase on SCC of each type of infection. The geometric mean SCC in bacteriologically negative quarters was 68 000 c/mL. In case of IMI, the retained SCC was 357 000, 857 000, 547 000, 1 024 000, 1 151 000, 138 000 and 105 000 c/mL in quarters infected by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, coliforms, staphylococci other than S. aureus and Corynebacterium bovis, respectively. The variation factors that could influence these SCC values and the bacteriological results are discussed.},

	abstract = {Field studies evaluating the effects of multiple concurrent preharvest interventions for Escherichia coli O157 are logistically and economically challenging; however, modeling techniques may provide useful information on these effects while also identifying crucial information gaps that can guide future research. We constructed a risk assessment model with data obtained from a systematic search of scientific literature. Parameter distributions were incorporated into a stochastic Monte Carlo modeling framework to examine the impacts of different combinations of preharvest and harvest interventions for E. coli O157 on the risk of beef carcass contamination. We estimated the risk of E. coli O157 carcass contamination conditional on preharvest fecal prevalence estimates, inclusion of feed additive(s) in the diet, vaccination for E. coli O157, transport and lairage effects, hide intervention(s), and carcass intervention(s). Prevalence parameters for E. coli O157 were assumed to encompass potential effects of concentration; therefore, concentration effects were not specifically evaluated in this study. Sensitivity analyses revealed that fecal prevalence, fecal-to-hide transfer, hide-to-carcass transfer, and carcass intervention efficacy significantly affected the risk of carcass contamination (correlation coefficients of 0.37, 0.56, 0.58, and -0.29, respectively). The results indicated that combinations of preharvest interventions may be particularly important for supplementing harvest interventions during periods of higher variability in fecal shedding prevalence (i.e., summer). Further assessments of the relationships among fecal prevalence and concentration, hide contamination, and subsequent carcass contamination are needed to further define risks and intervention impacts for E. coli O157 contamination of beef.},

Recombinant bovine somatotropin was found to increase the risk of clinical mastitis by approximately 25\% during the treatment period but there was insufficient data to draw firm conclusions about the effects of the drug on the prevalence of subclinical intra-mammary infections. Use of rBST increased the risk of a cow failing to conceive by approximately 40\%. For cows which did conceive, there was no effect on services per conception and only a small increase in average days open (5 days). Use of the drug had no effect on gestation length, but the information about a possible effect on the risk of twinning was equivocal. Cows treated with rBST had an estimated 55\% increase in the risk of developing clinical signs of lameness. Few studies reported data on culling, but based on those that did, there appeared to be an increase risk of culling evident in multiparous cows. Use of the drug in 1 lactation period appeared to reduce the risk of metabolic diseases (particularly ketosis) in the early period of the subsequent lactation.},

	abstract = {REASONS FOR PERFORMING THE STUDY: An analysis of the factors leading to equine disease events was used to support the development of international recommendations for mitigating the risk of disease dissemination through sport horse movements (high health, high performance -"HHP" horses). OBJECTIVES: A systematic review was undertaken to identify the factors resulting in equine disease events following international movement of horses to draw lessons in support of the development of international recommendations for the safe movements of a specific subpopulation of horses: the HHP sport horses. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The review covered disease events that occurred from 1995 to 2014, identified from the databases of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and international surveillance reports. RESULTS: Overall, 54 disease events were identified, of which 7 were contained in post-arrival quarantine and the others resulted in the introduction of pathogens into importing countries. For 81\% of the introductions, the OIE recommendations applicable to the diseases involved had not been complied with. Subclinical infections are a challenge for international trade: 88\% of the regulated movements that resulted in introductions involved infected horses that showed no clinical signs at the time of import. Biosecurity and management practices in resident equine populations were identified as important mitigating factors in preventing disease spread to the local horse population. CONCLUSIONS: The global increase in international horse movements, if not appropriately regulated and supervised by competent Veterinary Authorities and respective equine industry partners, could potentially lead to increased global spread of infectious equine diseases. Appropriate mitigation measures and compliance with OIE import recommendations for specific diseases can significantly reduce this risk. The recommendations proposed under the HHP approach take into account the mitigation measures identified by this review as important factors in preventing pathogen introduction and spread.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paratuberculosis has a worldwide distribution and many countries have implemented control programs to prevent transmission among and within herds. For these programs to be efficient, knowledge of the risk factors involved in transmission is essential. OBJECTIVES: Systematically review the scientific literature concerning risk factors associated with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) transmission to dairy calves. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: An electronic search was done in PubMed and CAB to retrieve references relevant to answer at least 1 of the 5 questions concerning neonatal environment, colostrum, milk, housing of calves, and contact of calves with adult cow feces as risk factors in MAP transmission. A 1st screening was done using titles only, then abstracts, and finally full-length articles were reviewed for relevance. From the articles selected, risk factors and presence of a significant association between these risk factors and MAP transmission were recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-three articles from 11 different countries and published in 12 different journals were reviewed. The most common study design was cross-sectional (n = 16). The case definition and diagnostic tests used were very variable among studies, but serum ELISA was used in most studies (n = 14). The study unit was the herd in 18 studies. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The contact of calves with adult cow feces is the most important risk factor in MAP transmission. The 5 categories of risk factors are linked to one another.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews recent progress in the development of syndromic surveillance systems for veterinary medicine. Peer-reviewed and grey literature were searched in order to identify surveillance systems that explicitly address outbreak detection based on systematic monitoring of animal population data, in any phase of implementation. The review found that developments in veterinary syndromic surveillance are focused not only on animal health, but also on the use of animals as sentinels for public health, representing a further step towards One Medicine. The main sources of information are clinical data from practitioners and laboratory data, but a number of other sources are being explored. Due to limitations inherent in the way data on animal health is collected, the development of veterinary syndromic surveillance initially focused on animal health data collection strategies, analyzing historical data for their potential to support systematic monitoring, or solving problems of data classification and integration. Systems based on passive notification or data transfers are now dealing with sustainability issues. Given the ongoing barriers in availability of data, diagnostic laboratories appear to provide the most readily available data sources for syndromic surveillance in animal health. As the bottlenecks around data source availability are overcome, the next challenge is consolidating data standards for data classification, promoting the integration of different animal health surveillance systems, and also the integration to public health surveillance. Moreover, the outputs of systems for systematic monitoring of animal health data must be directly connected to real-time decision support systems which are increasingly being used for disease management and control.},

	abstract = {The objectives of this study were to investigate the relationship between dry matter intake (DMI) and urinary purine derivative (PD) excretion, to develop equations to predict DMI and to determine the endogenous excretion of PD for beef and dairy cattle using a meta-analytical approach. To develop the models, 62 published studies for both dairy (45 studies) and beef cattle (17 studies) were compiled. Twenty models were tested using DMI (kg/d) and digestible DMI (dDMI, kg/d) as response variables and PD:creatinine (linear term: PD:C, and quadratic term: PD:C2), allantoin:creatinine (linear term: ALLA:C, and quadratic term: ALLA:C2), metabolic body weight (BW0.75, kg), milk yield (MY, kg/d), and their combination as explanatory variables for dairy and beef (except for MY) cattle. The models developed to predict DMI for dairy cattle were validated using an independent data set from 2 research trials carried out at the University of Wisconsin (trial 1: n = 45; trial 2: n = 50). A second set of models was developed to estimate the endogenous PD excretion. In all evaluated models, the effect of PD (either as PD:C or ALLA:C) was significant, supporting our hypothesis that PD are in fact correlated with DMI. Despite the BW-independent relationship between PD and DMI, the inclusion of BW0.75 in the models with PD:C and ALLA:C as predictors slightly decreased the values of root mean square error (RMSE) and Akaike information criterion for the models of DMI. Our models suggest that both DMI and dDMI can be equally well predicted by PD-related variables; however, predicting DMI seems more useful from a practical and experimental standpoint. The inclusion of MY into the dairy models substantially decreased RMSE and Akaike information criterion values, and further increased the precision of the equations. The model including PD:C, BW0.75, and MY presented greater concordance correlation coefficient (0.93 and 0.63 for trials 1 and 2, respectively) and lower RMSE of prediction (1.90 and 3.35 kg/d for trials 1 and 2, respectively) when tested in the validation data set, emerging as a potentially useful estimator of nutrient intake in dairy cows. Endogenous PD excretion was estimated by the intercept of the linear regression between DMI (g/kg of BW0.75) and PD excretion (mmol/kg of BW0.75) for beef (0.404 mmol/kg of BW0.75) and dairy cattle (0.651 mmol/kg of BW0.75). Based on the very close agreement between our results for beef cattle and the literature, the linear regression appears to be an adequate method to estimate endogenous PD excretion.},

The most commonly used experimental paradigm is the object-choice task in which a dog is given a choice of two containers and guided to the reinforced object by human pointing gestures. We review here studies of this type and attempt a meta-analysis of the available data. In the meta-analysis breeds of dogs were grouped into the eight categories of the American Kennel Club, and into four clusters identified by Parker and Ostrander [Parker, H.G., Ostrander, E.A., 2005. Canine genomics and genetics: running with the pack. PLoS Genet. 1, 507-513] on the basis of a genetic analysis. No differences in performance between breeds categorized in either fashion were identified. Rather, all dog breeds appear to be similarly and highly successful in following human points to locate desired food. We suggest this result could be due to the paucity of data available in published studies, and the restricted range of breeds tested.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis on the effects of management and animal-based factors on the reproductive efficiency of gestating sows can provide information on single-factor and interaction effects that may not have been detected in individual studies. This study analyzed the effects of such factors on the number of piglets born alive per litter (BA), piglet birth weight (BiW) and weaning weight (WW), and number of piglets born alive per kilogram of sow feed intake during gestation (BA/FI). A total of 51 papers and 7 data sources were identified for the meta-analysis, out of which 23 papers and 5 sets of production data were useable (a total of 121 treatments). The information gathered included the dependent variables as well as information regarding animal, management, and feed characteristics. While a number of factors were individually significant, the multivariate models identified significant effects only of 1) floor type (P = 0.003), sow BW at the end of gestation (P = 0.002), and housing (stalls vs. loose; P = 0.004) on BA; as floor type and housing were confounded, they were included in 2 separate models. The BA was higher on solid (12.1) in comparison to partly slatted (11.4) and fully slatted floors (10.2); 2) sow gestation environment (P = 0.017) and gestation feed allowance (P = 0.046) on BiW, with BiW of pigs higher for sows kept outdoors rather than indoors (1.75 versus 1.49 kg); 3) parity number (P = 0.003) and feed intake during gestation (P = 0.017) on WW; in addition there was an interaction between parity number x feed ME and parity number x feed CP content of feed during gestation on WW, with the positive effects of feed ME and CP contents seen during early rather than later parities; and 4) floor type (P = 0.019) and feed crude fiber (P = 0.003) for BA/FI with a greater number for those kept on solid floors (5.11) versus partially and fully slatted floors (4.07 and 4.05). The meta-analysis confirmed the significant effect of several well-known factors on the efficiency of gestating sows and, importantly, the interactions between these factors. In addition, the effects of some less established factors were noted, such as floor type. The results may contribute towards the improvement of efficiency of gestating sow systems by better understanding of the various factors that influence this.},

The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review to evaluate the methods that have been used for estimating the sizes of owned cat and dog populations and to assess the biases associated with those methods.A comprehensive, systematic search of seven electronic bibliographic databases and the Google search engine was carried out using a range of different search terms for cats, dogs and population. The inclusion criteria were that the studies had involved owned or pet domestic dogs and/or cats, provided an estimate of the size of the owned dog or cat population, collected raw data on dog and cat ownership, and analysed primary data. Data relating to study methodology were extracted and assessed for biases. RESULTS: Seven papers were included in the final analysis. Collection methods used to select participants in the included studies were: mailed surveys using a commercial list of contacts, door to door surveys, random digit dialled telephone surveys, and randomised telephone surveys using a commercial list of numbers. Analytical and statistical methods used to estimate the pet population size were: mean number of dogs/cats per household multiplied by the number of households in an area, human density multiplied by number of dogs per human, and calculations using predictors of pet ownership. CONCLUSION: The main biases of the studies included selection bias, non-response bias, measurement bias and biases associated with length of sampling time. Careful design and planning of studies is a necessity before executing a study to estimate pet populations.},

	abstract = {Disease surveillance programmes ought to be evaluated regularly to ensure they provide valuable information in an efficient manner. Evaluation of human and animal health surveillance programmes around the world is currently not standardized and therefore inconsistent. The aim of this systematic review was to review surveillance system attributes and the methods used for their assessment, together with the strengths and weaknesses of existing frameworks for evaluating surveillance in animal health, public health and allied disciplines. Information from 99 articles describing the evaluation of 101 surveillance systems was examined. A wide range of approaches for assessing 23 different system attributes was identified although most evaluations addressed only one or two attributes and comprehensive evaluations were uncommon. Surveillance objectives were often not stated in the articles reviewed and so the reasons for choosing certain attributes for assessment were not always apparent. This has the potential to introduce misleading results in surveillance evaluation. Due to the wide range of system attributes that may be assessed, methods should be explored which collapse these down into a small number of grouped characteristics by focusing on the relationships between attributes and their links to the objectives of the surveillance system and the evaluation. A generic and comprehensive evaluation framework could then be developed consisting of a limited number of common attributes together with several sets of secondary attributes which could be selected depending on the disease or range of diseases under surveillance and the purpose of the surveillance. Economic evaluation should be an integral part of the surveillance evaluation process. This would provide a significant benefit to decision-makers who often need to make choices based on limited or diminishing resources.},

	abstract = {Brucellosis is a worldwide extended zoonosis with a heavy economic and public health impact. Cattle, sheep and goats are infected by smooth Brucella abortus and Brucella melitensis, and represent a common source of the human disease. Brucellosis diagnosis in these animals is largely based on detection of a specific immunoresponse. We review here the immunological tests used for the diagnosis of cattle brucellosis. First, we discuss how the diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) and specificity (DSp), balance should be adjusted for brucellosis diagnosis, and the difficulties that brucellosis tests specifically present for the estimation of DSe/DSp in frequentistic (gold standard) and Bayesian analyses. Then, we present a systematic review (PubMed, GoogleScholar and CABdirect) of works (154 out of 991; years 1960-August 2017) identified (by title and Abstract content) as DSe and DSp studies of smooth lipopolysaccharide, O-polysaccharide-core, native hapten and protein diagnostic tests. We summarize data of gold standard studies (n=23) complying with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria with regards to test methodology and definition of the animals studied (infected and S19 or RB51 vaccinated cattle, and Brucella-free cattle affected or not by false positive serological reactions). We also discuss some studies (smooth lipopolysaccharide tests, protein antibody and delayed type hypersensitivity [skin] tests) that do not meet the criteria and yet fill some of the gaps in information. We review Bayesian studies (n=5) and report that in most cases priors and assumptions on conditional dependence/independence are not coherent with the variable serological picture of the disease in different epidemiological scenarios and the bases (antigen, isotype and immunoglobulin properties involved) of brucellosis tests, practical experience and the results of gold standard studies. We conclude that very useful lipopolysaccharide (buffered plate antigen and indirect ELISA) and native hapten polysaccharide and soluble protein tests exist, provided they are applied taking into account the means available and the epidemiological contexts of this disease: i) mass vaccination; ii) elimination based on vaccination combined with test-and-slaughter; and iii) surveillance and existence of false positive serological reactions. We also conclude that the insistence in recent literature on the lack of usefulness of all smooth lipopolysaccharide or native hapten polysaccharide tests in areas where S19 vaccination is implemented is a misinterpretation that overlooks scientific and practical evidence.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis of the impact of monensin on growing and finishing beef cattle was conducted after a search of the literature. A total of 40 peer-reviewed articles and 24 additional trial reports with monensin feeding in beef cattle were selected, after meeting apriori quality criteria. Data for each trial were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis software in STATA. Estimated effect size of monensin was calculated for feed efficiency (FE), ADG, and DMI. Monensin use in growing and finishing beef cattle reduced DMI (P {\textless} 0.001) and improved both ADG (P {\textless} 0.001) and FE (P {\textless} 0.001). The average concentration of monensin in feed across studies was 28.1 mg/kg feed (100\% DM) and this resulted in approximately a 6.4\% (but only 2.5 to 3.5\% in the last 2 decades) increase in FE, 3\% decrease in DMI, and 2.5\% increase in ADG. All 3 outcomes displayed moderate and significant heterogeneity of monensin response (I(2), which is a measure of variation beyond chance, = 29\% for FE, 42\% for DMI, and 23\% for ADG); therefore, random effects models were used for those outcomes. There were no single influential studies that overweighted the findings for any outcome. Meta-regression analysis of the effect sizes obtained from these data showed that dietary factors, dose, and study design were influential in modifying effect size of monensin treatment. Use of corn silage in the diet influenced the effect size of monensin for DMI and FE, with diets containing corn silage resulting in a greater improvement in FE and a larger effect on reducing DMI. Studies conducted to assess multiple doses of monensin showed similar effects to the use of corn silage in the diet. Studies conducted in the United States or with higher ADG in control animals ({\textgreater}1.17 kg/d) showed less effect of monensin on ADG. Pen-level studies showed a greater monensin increase on ADG than did those conducted on individual animals. Linear effect of monensin dose was observed for FE, DMI, and ADG outcomes, with greater effects on improving FE and reducing DMI with larger doses of monensin but lesser improvement in ADG with increasing dose. These findings confirm that monensin improves FE in growing and finishing beef cattle, and that this effect is linear with dose.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis of the impact of monensin on health and reproductive outcomes in dairy cattle was conducted. A total of 16 papers were identified with sufficient data and quality to evaluate health and reproductive outcomes for monensin. The available trials provided approximately 9,500 cows with sufficient data for analysis. This provided good statistical power to examine the effects of monensin on health and reproduction. Over all the trials analyzed, monensin decreased the risk of ketosis [relative risk (RR) = 0.75], displaced abomasums (RR = 0.75), and mastitis (RR = 0.91). No significant effects of monensin were found for milk fever, lameness, dystocia, retained placenta, or metritis. Monensin had no effect on first-service conception risk (RR = 0.97) or days to pregnancy (hazard ratio = 0.93). However, the impact of monensin on dystocia, retained placenta, and metritis was heterogeneous for all 3 outcome measures and random effect models were utilized. Causes of the heterogeneity were explored with meta-regression. Days of treatment with monensin before calving increased the risk of dystocia. Delivery method of monensin influenced the incidence of retained placenta and metritis, with risk being lower with controlled release capsule treatment compared with delivery in either topdress or in a total mixed ration. Days of treatment before calving also influenced retained placenta with an increase in risk with more days treated before calving. Improvements in ketosis, displaced abomasums, and mastitis with monensin were achieved. Exposure to prolonged treatment in the dry period with monensin may increase the risk of dystocia and retained placenta.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis of the impact of monensin on production outcomes in dairy cattle was conducted using the 36 papers and 77 trials that contained eligible data. Statistical analyses were conducted in STATA and included a consideration of fixed or random effects models, assessment of publication bias, and impact of influential studies. Meta-regression was used to investigate sources of heterogeneity of response. There were 71 trials containing data from 255 trial sites and 9,677 cows examining milk production and composition. Monensin use in lactating dairy cattle significantly decreased dry matter intake by 0.3 kg, but increased milk yield by 0.7 kg and improved milk production efficiency by 2.5\%. Monensin decreased milk fat percentage 0.13\%, but had no effect on milk fat yield; however, there was significant heterogeneity between studies for both of these responses. Milk protein percentage was decreased 0.03\%, but protein yield was increased 0.016 kg/d with treatment. Monensin had no effect on milk lactose percentage. Monensin increased body condition score by 0.03 and similarly improved body weight change (0.06 kg/d). Analysis of milk fatty acid profile data indicated that monensin was associated with a reduction of short-chain fatty acids (from 1 to 12\% reduction) and stearic acid (-7.8\%). The impact of monensin on linoleic and linolenic acids was variable, but monensin significantly increased conjugated linoleic acid (22\%). Meta-regression of the effect of monensin on milk component percentages and yields indicated an influence of delivery method, stage of lactation, dose, and diet. Increasing concentrations of C18:1 in the diet enhanced the effect of monensin on decreasing milk fat yield, whereas increasing the rumen peptide balance increased the effect of monensin on milk protein yield. These findings indicate a benefit of monensin for improving milk production efficiency while maintaining body condition. The effect of monensin on milk fat percentage and yield was influenced by diet.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis of the impact of monensin on metabolism of dairy cattle was conducted following a search of the literature. A total of 59 studies with monensin feeding in dairy cattle were identified in which 30 papers and 45 trials contained metabolic data. The beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) data were obtained from over 4,000 cows and 115 trial sites. Data for each trial were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis software in Stata. Estimated effect sizes of monensin were calculated on blood concentrations of BHBA, acetoacetate, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), glucose, cholesterol, urea, calcium, insulin, and milk urea. Monensin use in lactating dairy cattle significantly reduced blood concentrations of BHBA 13\%, acetoacetate 14\%, and NEFA 7\%. Monensin increased glucose 3\% and urea 6\%. Monensin had no significant effect on cholesterol, calcium, milk urea, or insulin. Heterogeneity was significant for BHBA and cholesterol [I(2) (measure of variation beyond chance) = 37 and 54\%, respectively]; therefore, random effects models were used for those analytes. Publication bias existed with the monensin effect on BHBA, with a tendency for studies to be published if there was a significant reduction in this ketone. Meta-regression analysis of the effect sizes obtained from the metabolic data showed that method of delivery, timing of administration, stage of lactation, and diet were influential in modifying effect size of monensin treatment. Use of top dress or delivery via a controlled release capsule reduced the magnitude of effect on BHBA (coefficient +0.353); however, top dress use compared with controlled release capsule or total mixed ration enhanced the monensin effect on glucose (coefficient +0.296). There was a greater impact with monensin on reducing BHBA in early lactation (coefficient -0.151) and in pasture-based trials (coefficient -0.194). Use of monensin in both the pre- and postcalving periods was associated with an enhanced impact on NEFA (coefficient -0.254). Monensin had less impact on serum glucose in the pre-calving time period (coefficient -0.237). These findings demonstrate an improvement in the energy metabolism of dairy cows supplemented with monensin.},

	abstract = {A systematic review of the scientific literature on relationships between management practices used on dairy farms and herd somatic cell count (SCC) was undertaken to distinguish those management practices that have been consistently shown to be associated with herd SCC from those lacking evidence of association. Relevant literature was identified using a combination of database searches (PubMed, Medline, CAB, Agricola, and Web of Science) and iterative screening of references. To be included in the review, a manuscript had to be published after 1979 in French, English, or Dutch; study design had to be other than case report or case series; herds studied had to be composed of {\textgreater}/= 40 milking cows producing on average {\textgreater}/= 7,000kg of milk in 305 d; interventions studied had to be management practices applied at the herd level and used as udder health control strategies; and SCC had to be measured using electronic cell counting methods. The 36 manuscripts selected were mainly observational cross-sectional studies; 8 manuscripts dealt exclusively with automatic milking systems and 4 with management of calves and heifers and its effect on SCC in early lactation heifers. Most practices having consistent associations with SCC were related to milking procedures: wearing gloves during milking, using automatic take-offs, using postmilking teat dipping, milking problem cows last, yearly inspection of the milking system, and use of a technique to keep cows standing following milking; all were consistently associated with lower herd SCC. Other practices associated with lower SCC were the use of a freestall system, sand bedding, cleaning the calving pen after each calving, surveillance of dry-cow udders for mastitis, use of blanket dry-cow therapy, parenteral selenium supplementation, udder hair management, and frequent use of the California Mastitis Test. Regarding SCC of heifers, most of the consistent associations reported were related to interventions made during the peripartum period. Studies on automatic milking systems have frequently reported elevation of the herd SCC following transition to the new system. These elevations seemed to be mediated both by the lack of monitoring of chronically infected cows and by an elevated incidence of intramammary infections. By assembling the results reported in many different studies, this review generates a more comprehensive understanding of the management practices influencing SCC and highlights areas of SCC control knowledge that lack evidence of effectiveness.},

Comparisons between countries' schemes allow others to assess best practice, and aggregating published results from eradication schemes provides greater statistical power when analysing data. Aggregating data requires that results derived from different testing schemes be calibrated against one another. The authors aimed to evaluate whether relationships between published BVDV test results could be created and present the outcome of a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The results are tabulated, providing a summary of papers where there is potential cross-calibration and a summary of the obstacles preventing such data aggregation. Although differences in measuring BVDV present barriers to academic progress, they may also affect progress within individual eradication schemes. The authors examined the time taken to retest following an initial antibody BVDV test in the Scottish eradication scheme. The authors demonstrate that retesting occurred quicker if the initial not negative test was from blood rather than milk samples. Such differences in the response of farmers/veterinarians to tests may be of interest to the design of future schemes.},

	doi = {10.1111/vec.12275},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To discuss controversies surrounding antimicrobial use in critically ill horses. DATA SOURCES: PubMed searches from 1970-present for terms including, but not limited to: "horse," "foal," "antimicrobial," "prophylaxis," "infection," "surgery," "sepsis," and "antimicrobial resistance." HUMAN DATA SYNTHESIS: Increasing bacterial antimicrobial resistance has changed first-line antimicrobial choices and prompted shortening of the duration of prophylactic and therapeutic treatment. The need to decrease bacterial resistance development to critically important antimicrobials has been highlighted. VETERINARY DATA SYNTHESIS: Veterinary medicine has followed a similar trend but often without a high-level evidence. Common dilemmas include diseases in which the theoretically most effective drug is a reserved antimicrobial, the inability to differentiate infectious from noninfectious disease, the duration and necessity of prophylactic antimicrobials and use of antimicrobials in primary gastrointestinal disease. These problems are illustrated using examples of purulent infections, neonatal sepsis, colic surgery, and treatment of colitis. Although enrofloxacin, cephalosporins, and doxycycline, in contrast to gentamicin, reach therapeutic concentrations within the lungs of healthy horses, the first two should not be used as first line treatment due to their reserved status. Due to the high risk of bacterial sepsis, antimicrobial treatment remains indispensable in compromised neonatal foals but shortening the length of antimicrobial treatment might be prudent. One prospective randomized study demonstrated no difference between 3 and 5 days of perioperative antimicrobial treatment in colic surgery but shorter durations were not evaluated. High-level evidence to recommend antimicrobial treatment of adult horses with undifferentiated diarrhea does not exist. CONCLUSIONS: Few evidence-based recommendations can be made. Commonly used antimicrobial combinations remain the mainstay for treating purulent infections. Antimicrobial treatment for compromised foals should not extend beyond recovery. Continuation of prophylactic antimicrobials {\textgreater}3 days is likely unnecessary after colic surgery; shorter durations might be equally effective. Antimicrobial prophylaxis in adult horses with diarrhea is unlikely to be beneficial.},

Prompt and correct detection and diagnosis are critical for improving economic and welfare outcomes. Few tests are currently available to aid the dairy farmer in the detection and diagnosis of foot lesions. The objectives of this systematic review were to identify those tests that have been investigated for the detection and diagnosis of foot lesions causing lameness in dairy cows, evaluate the methodological quality of the studies investigating the identified tests, compare the accuracy of the identified test, and determine which tests can be recommended for implementation on the farm based on accuracy and practicality for use by dairy farmers. A comprehensive literature search resulted in 2137 papers. After removing duplicates and performing relevance screening, 12 papers with 20 studies met the inclusion criteria. Pertinent data from each study were extracted using a standardised form. Eligible studies were grouped based on the objective of the test under investigation, resulting in the following groups of disorders: lameness, foot lesions, sole ulcer, and digital dermatitis. Methodological quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool which includes four domains: animal selection, index test, reference test and flow and timing. Incomplete reporting in the studies limited the assessment of methodological quality. The animal selection domain was particularly poorly reported. No single study could be classified as being at low risk of bias across all domains of the QUADAS-2 tool. One automated test was identified, while all others were manually operated. No studies reported the cost of the test in question and only two studies reported the time taken to carry out the procedures involved with using the test in question. It was not possible to compare the accuracy of these tests or recommend which tests are suitable for implementation on the farm. This was due to incomplete reporting of information and significant risk of bias in all studies.},

	abstract = {Routine procedures carried out on piglets (i.e. castration, tail docking, teeth clipping, and ear notching) are considered painful. Unfortunately the efficacy of current pain mitigation modalities is poorly understood. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the existing primary scientific literature regarding the effectiveness of pain management interventions used for routine procedures on piglets. The review question was, 'In piglets under twenty-eight days old, undergoing castration, tail docking, teeth clipping, and/or methods of identification that involve cutting of the ear tissue, what is the effect of pain mitigation compared with no pain mitigation on behavioral and non-behavioral outcomes that indicate procedural pain and post-procedural pain?' A review protocol was designed a priori. Data sources used were Agricola (EBSCO), CAB Abstracts (Thomson Reuters), PubMed, Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), BIOSIS Previews (Thomson Reuters), and ProQuest Dissertations \& Theses Full Text. No restrictions on year of publication or language were placed on the search. Eligible studies assessed an intervention designed to mitigate the pain of the procedures of interest and included a comparison group that did not receive an intervention. Eligible non-English studies were translated using a translation service. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance using pre-defined questions. Data were extracted from relevant articles onto pre-defined forms. From the 2203 retrieved citations forty publications, containing 52 studies met the eligibility criteria. In 40 studies, piglets underwent castration only. In seven studies, piglets underwent tail docking only. In one study, piglets underwent teeth clipping only, and in one study piglets underwent ear notching only. Three studies used multiple procedures. Thirty-two trial arms assessed general anesthesia protocols, 30 trial arms assessed local anesthetic protocols, and 28 trial arms assessed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) protocols. Forty-one trial arms were controls where piglets received either placebo or no treatment. Forty-five outcomes were extracted from the studies, however only the results from studies that assessed cortisol (six studies), beta -endorphins (one study), vocalisations (nine studies), and pain-related behaviors (nine studies) are reported. Other outcomes were reported in only one or two studies. Confident decision making will likely be difficult based on this body of work because lack of comprehensive reporting precludes calculation of the magnitude of pain mitigation for most outcomes.},

	abstract = {The Commission requested that EFSA review relevant new scientific references on electrical stunning of poultry and to recommend, if necessary, new electrical requirements applicable for waterbath stunning equipment. A systematic literature review was conducted to determine those electrical parameters that would deliver an effective stun so that birds would be rendered unconscious and insensible until death. Inspection data from slaughterhouse inspections conducted both in Member States in and non-Member States were included. Many of the published studies did not allow a comprehensive analysis due to different study designs and incomplete data. There are few observational studies in abattoirs to determine the numbers of birds that are effectively stunned, however, the inspection data from the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) did not identify major problems but, for practical reasons, they used non-EEG (electro-encephalogram) methods to ascertain the effectiveness of a stun. At the present time, an EEG is the most reliable indicator of unconsciousness and insensibility. Clinical somatosensory indicators are not as reliable. The aim of a stunning system is to achieve a 100\% effective stun, and the most effective electrical parameters in use can achieve an effectiveness of up to 96\% as measured using EEG ascertainment methods (100\% were reported as unconscious using non-EEG methods). It is recommended that the Regulation should indicate minimum current for each bird, frequency and current type as well as the wave characteristics – duty cycle and waveform. There should be better surveillance and monitoring of the electrical parameters in use at abattoirs and, in addition, methods that allow the accurate measurement of actual electrical current flowing through each bird should be further developed. Research on effective stunning should be validated by the measurement of EEG activity and related to clinical measures that are easier to use in practice.},

Past reviews, using vote-counting methods, have described pollution as one of the major threats faced by amphibians. However, vote-counting methods lack strong statistical power, do not permit one to determine the magnitudes of effects, and do not compare responses among predefined groups. To address these challenges, we conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured the effects of different chemical pollutants (nitrogenous and phosphorous compounds, pesticides, road deicers, heavy metals, and other wastewater contaminants) at environmentally relevant concentrations on amphibian survival, mass, time to hatching, time to metamorphosis, and frequency of abnormalities. The overall effect size of pollutant exposure was a medium decrease in amphibian survival and mass and a large increase in abnormality frequency. This translates to a 14.3\% decrease in survival, a 7.5\% decrease in mass, and a 535\% increase in abnormality frequency across all studies. In contrast, we found no overall effect of pollutants on time to hatching and time to metamorphosis. We also found that effect sizes differed among experimental venues and among types of pollutants, but we only detected weak differences among amphibian families. These results suggest that variation in sensitivity to contaminants is generally independent of phylogeny. Some publication bias (i.e., selective reporting) was detected, but only for mass and the interaction effect size among stressors. We conclude that the overall impact of pollution on amphibians is moderately to largely negative. This implies that pollutants at environmentally relevant concentrations pose an important threat to amphibians and may play a role in their present global decline.},

	abstract = {Systematic review (SR) and meta-analyses (MA) methodologies were used to identify, critically evaluate and synthesize prevalence and concentration estimates for Escherichia coli O157 contamination along the beef production chain, and to illustrate differences based on cattle types and seasonality in North America from the scientific peer-reviewed literature. Four electronic databases were searched to identify relevant articles. Two independent reviewers performed all SR steps. Random effects MA models were used to estimate the pooled prevalence and concentration of E. coli O157 in feces, hides and carcasses of cattle processed in North America, including their seasonal estimates. The potential sources of between studies heterogeneity were identified using meta-regression and sub-group analysis. Results indicated differences in the fecal prevalence of E. coli O157 among cattle types: 10.68\% (95\% CI: 9.17-12.28\%) in fed beef, 4.65\% (95\% CI: 3.37-6.10\%) in adult beef, and 1.79\% (95\% CI: 1.20-2.48\%) in adult dairy. Fed beef fecal prevalence was 10.65\% (95\% CI: 8.93-12.49\%) during summer and 9.17\% (95\% CI: 5.24-13.98\%) during the winter months. For adult beef, the fecal prevalence was 7.86\% (95\% CI: 5.43-10.66\%) during summer, and 4.21\% (95\% CI: 1.95-7.13\%) during winter. Among adult dairy, the fecal prevalence was 2.27\% (95\% CI: 1.5-3.18\%) during summer, and 0.36\% (95\% CI: 0.09-0.74\%) during winter. There was a significantly higher percentage of hides with E. coli O157 concentration {\textgreater}/= 40 CFU/100 cm(2) on hides of fed beef sampled at the processing plant (23.81\%; 95\% CI: 14.79-34.15\%) compared to those sampled at the feedlot (1.74\%; 95\% CI: 0.53-3.44\%). Prevalence of E. coli O157 on carcass surfaces differed by season only at the post-evisceration stage, but decreased considerably through the subsequent processing stages. Country, study setting, detection method, hide swab area, and study design were identified as significant sources of heterogeneity among studies reporting prevalence of E. coli O157 along the beef production chain. The pooled prevalence and concentration estimates from this study provide a sound and reliable microbiological basis for risk assessment modeling of E. coli O157 and other pathogens in the food chain.},

	abstract = {Although a causal link between Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) and Crohn's disease has not been proved, previous studies suggest that the potential routes of human exposure to MAP should be investigated. We conducted a systematic review of literature concerning the likelihood of contamination of food products with MAP and the likely changes in the quantity of MAP in dairy and meat products along their respective production chains. Relevant data were extracted from 65 research papers and synthesized qualitatively. Although estimates of the prevalence of Johne's disease are scarce, particularly for non-dairy herds, the available data suggest that the likelihood of contamination of raw milk with MAP in most studied regions is substantial. The presence of MAP in raw and pasteurized milk has been the subject of several studies which show that pasteurized milk is not always MAP-free and that the effectiveness of pasteurization in inactivating MAP depends on the initial concentration of the agent in raw milk. The most recent studies indicated that beef can be contaminated with MAP via dissemination of the pathogen in the tissues of infected animals. Currently available data suggests that the likelihood of dairy and meat products being contaminated with MAP on retail sale should not be ignored.},

The applicability of diagnostic testing modalities and the merit of traditional approaches to management, such as dietary changes, are discussed. The role and usefulness of both traditional and novel anti-emetic drugs is examined, including in specific circumstances such as following cytotoxic drug treatment. The review also examines areas in which common clinical practice is not necessarily supported by objective evidence and, as such, highlights questions worthy of further clinical research.},

	abstract = {A quantitative assessment of dairy cow responses to contact current (stray voltage) at 50 or 60 Hz was conducted using meta-analysis and pooled analysis methodology. The objective was to more accurately quantify the minimum exposure level (threshold) at which dairy cows respond and to identify sources of heterogeneity among studies. Several medical and agricultural databases were used to locate individual studies for the systematic literature review, from which 22 published studies of stray voltage and behavioral response or milk yield met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis models were constructed to assess the percentage of cows with a behavioral response at documented exposure levels, and the summary relative risk estimate for all exposure pathways combined was calculated for each 1-mA increment from 1.0 through 5.0 mA. The meta-analysis of percentage response showed that cows exhibited statistically significant first behavioral responses at 3.0 mA, response probability increased with exposure levels, and exposure pathways contributed to heterogeneity in the model. The pooled analysis of mean behavioral response threshold was based on experimental studies of ascending series of current exposures on 355 cows. The overall weighted mean for first behavioral response to current was 4.0 mA. Ten of the studies that met the inclusion criteria addressed milk production, but heterogeneity in exposure pathways, patterns, and duration precluded meta-analysis or data pooling. The milk production studies ranged in size from 4 to 48 cows and used switchback or paired design to increase power. A qualitative narrative review of these studies indicated that production was not affected by exposure to contact current at levels of 3 mA or lower for exposures of up to 21 d or 4 wk.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Analysis of the literature using electronic libraries (PubMed, Medline), German veterinary medical journals and obstetrical textbooks. RESULTS: The therapy includes the attempt to rotate the uterus back into its physiological position. Direct and indirect methods of retorsion are available and applied according to the case conditions. Subsequently, the extraction of the calf can be performed via vaginal delivery or caesarean section. The presence of uterine torsion always leads to dystocia. Following a successful retorsion, the time and degree of uterine torsion strongly influence the progress of the birth. The prognosis also depends on the aforementioned factors and varies between good to unsuccessful. The vitality of the calf displays great variation depending on the literature (14-90\%), however, is generally greater under field than clinical conditions. Focussing on the puerperal development of the cow, all grades from mild irritations of the uterine involution to fatal complications occur. The influence on fertility depends on the progress of the birth and existing secondary complications. The risk for electrolyte disturbances is increased (approximately 50\%) as is the risk of birth-associated injuries (approximately 20\%). The incidence of placental retention varies widely between different authors (3-52\%).},

RESULTS: Uterine torsion is a very important maternal reason for dystocia as most cases occur during parturition. The post-cervical torsion (combined uterine and vaginal torsion, Torsio uteri and vaginae) is more commonly diagnosed than an intra-cervical or pre-cervical torsion. Torsions to the left occur more frequently than to the right. Clinical symptoms clearly vary depending on the degree of torsion. The frequency in relation to all parturitions is described as between 0.5 and 1\%, whereas the percentage of uterine torsions presented to the veterinarian as a reason for dystocia varies between 2.7 and 65\%. The pathogenesis of uterine torsion remains unclear; however, general agreement exists that the cow is predisposed to uterine torsion due to its anatomy. It appears that the Brown Swiss is more often affected than other cattle breeds.},

Based on the developmental plasticity theory, early disturbances of synaptic availability of serotonin may promote phenotypic adaptations and late disorders of energy balance regulation leading to obesity and associated diseases. The aim of this systematic review is to determine the effects of pharmacological neonatal inhibition of serotonin reuptake by fluoxetine, on parameters related to feeding behavior and energy balance. Literature searches were performed in Medline/PubMed and Lilacs databases, out of which 9726 studies were found. Using predefined protocol and registered on CAMARADES website, 23 studies were included for qualitative synthesis. The internal validity was assessed using the SYRCLE's risk of bias toll. Kappa index was also measured for analyzing the concordance between the reviewers. In addition, the PRISMA statement was used for reporting this systematic review. Most of the included studies demonstrated that neonatal serotonin reuptake inhibition is associated with long term reduced body weight, lower fat mass and higher thermogenic capacity and mitochondrial oxygen consumption in key metabolic tissues. Therefore, experimental fluoxetine exposure during neonatal development may promote long-term changes related to energy balance associated with a lean phenotype.},

However, there is still a lack of scientific evidence of the efficacy of these substances to allow veterinary experts to make decisions about their use in horses. The objective of this study was to evaluate, through a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA), the efficacy of HyA, associated or not with other drugs, and PHyd in relieving lameness in horses with osteoarthritis. The searches for primary studies were conducted on four search platforms. The efficacy of HyA and PHyd was estimated through the relative risk difference method. Heterogeneity was observed in the efficacy of HyA, indicating long-term ineffectiveness of this drug when associated or not with anti-inflammatory drugs. In contrast, the results indicate that PHyd is an effective alternative therapy, with a long period of action in reducing lameness in horses with osteoarthritis. This study provides evidence that the application of PHyd and HyA is effective in reducing lameness caused by osteoarthritis in horses at different time periods, where PHyd has a longer time of action.},

	abstract = {Despite considerable efforts made to address the issue of brucellosis worldwide, its prevalence in dairy products remains difficult to estimate and represents an important public health issue in many areas of the globe today. This is partly explained by the increasing tendency for consumption of raw dairy products, making the prevention and control of this zoonosis even more critical. This review summarizes reports published since the early 2000s on human brucellosis caused by contaminated dairy products and the systems of evaluation and assessment which are used to improve the diagnosis, surveillance, control and prevention of the disease. For this purpose, five comprehensive electronic databases were investigated and relevant studies were identified for systematic review. The design and quality of the studies revealed notable variation, especially in the methods used for the detection and characterization of Brucella spp. This report provides helpful information about the health risk associated with the consumption of raw milk and relevant preventive strategies.},

The objectives of the study reported here were: (i) to identify and assess the evidence and knowledge gaps in published studies that have examined brucellosis in different food-producing animals in Mosul, Iraq; using systematic review approach, and (ii) to quantify the seroprevalence of brucellosis in the city using meta-analysis approach. Google Scholar was used as a search engine to track pertinent peer-reviewed research reports. The search was conducted on November 24, 2019. Keywords used were: brucella, animal, Mosul, Iraq. Peer-reviewed published studies, MSc theses, and PhD dissertations written in Arabic or English were included. Duplicate records were removed, and the screening process was conducted at three levels: titles, abstracts, and full-text articles. Identified studies that have reported the seroprevalence of brucellosis were included in a meta-analysis to calculate an overall prevalence. A total of 214 records were initially identified. Seventeen research reports were added from personal contact and qualified articles' references list. Thirty six articles were qualified for review after removing 35 duplicate records, 155 titles, 11 abstracts, and 5 full text articles. Seventeen studies reported the prevalence of brucellosis, 11 studies assessed different serological tests for diagnosis of brucellosis, 9 studies isolated Brucella spp. from animal specimens and/or animal products, and 4 studies assessed vaccination procedures against brucellosis. The overall seroprevalence of brucellosis in food-producing animals in Mosul over a period of 40 years was 14.14\%, including 14.46\% for sheep, 12.99\% for goats, 11.69\% for cattle, and 22.64\% for buffalo. The study concluded that the disease is evident in the city with increasing trends over the years, buffalo shows high seroprevalence, the degree of agreement of Rose-Bengal test as a screening test is fair compared to more accurate serological tests such as ELISA; and the disease constitutes a public health concern in the city. Additional studies are important to identify the overlooked predisposing factors, estimate the abortion rate attributable to brucellosis in food-producing animals, and evaluate efficacy of vaccination programs in reducing the prevalence of brucellosis and/or abortion rate.},

This meta-analysis quantitatively evaluates the effectiveness of multiple strategies on inhibiting RP numbers and their influence on ruminal fermentation and animal performance. This study compared 66 peer-reviewed articles (16 manuscripts for complete and 50 manuscripts for partial RP inhibition that used supplemental phytochemicals and lipids, published from 2000 to 2018, to inhibit RP in vivo. Data were structured to allow a meta-analytical evaluation of differences in response to different treatments (complete RP inhibition, phytochemicals, and lipids). Data were analyzed using mixed models with the random effect of experiment and weighted by the inverse of pooled standard error of the mean (SEM) squared. Supplemental phytochemicals and LCFA had no effects on inhibiting RP numbers; however, supplemental MCFA had a potent antiprotozoal effect. Both complete and partial RP (supplemental phytochemicals and lipids) inhibition decreased methane production, total tract digestibility of OM and NDF, and ruminal NH(3)-N concentration and increased propionate molar proportion. Methane production, molar proportions of acetate and propionate, total tract NDF digestibility were affected by the interaction of treatment (supplemental phytochemicals and lipids) and RP numbers. Supplemental phytochemicals and lipids can be effective in reducing methane production when RP numbers is below 7 Log(10) cells/mL, especially by supplemental saponins, tannins, and MCFA. In terms of animal performance, supplemental tannins could be recommended to control methane emissions without affecting animal performance. However, their negative effects on total tract digestibility could be a drawback when feeding tannins to ruminants. The negative effects of supplemental lipids on milk fat composition should be considered when feeding lipids to ruminants. In conclusion, ruminal protozoa play important roles on methanogenesis, fiber digestion, and ruminal NH(3)-N concentration, regardless of experimental diets and conditions; supplemental phytochemicals and lipids can be effective on reducing methane production when RP numbers is below 7 Log10 cells/mL. Among these partial RP inhibition strategies, supplemental tannins could be recommended to control methane production.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this research was to develop and test methods for accessing and evaluating information on the biological plausibility of observed associations between exposures or interventions and outcomes to generate scientific evidence for action consistent with practice in systematic reviews. STUDY DESIGN: To undertake this research, we used the example of the observed associations between antimicrobial use in food animals and increased risks of human exposures to antimicrobial-resistant pathogens of zoonotic origin. METHODS: We conducted a scoping search using terms related to biological plausibility or mechanism to identify key references. As recommended by these references, we also used expert consultation with researchers and a public health informationist. We used their recommendations, which included expert consultation, to identify mechanisms relevant to biological plausibility of the association we selected to test. We used the reviews conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines Development Group in support of reducing antimicrobial use in food animal production to populate our model for assessing biological plausibility. RESULTS: We were able to develop a transparent model for biological plausibility based on the adverse outcome pathway used in toxicology and ecology. We were also able to populate this model using the WHO reviews. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of biological plausibility used transparent and validated methods to assess the evidence used in systematic reviews based on the observational studies accessed through searches of the scientific literature. Given the importance of this topic in systematic reviews and evidence-based decision-making, further research is needed to define and test the methodological approaches to access and properly evaluate information from the scientific literature.},

A systematic review was undertaken to explore the measurable impact of six conditions: arthritis, sheep measles, pleurisy, pneumonia, grass seeds and rib fractures, on the production of lamb and mutton across the meat value chain. Peer-reviewed scientific literature from three databases and non-peer-reviewed articles and reports from Australian government and non-government websites were searched between 11 and 17 November 2019. Original articles, including studies conducted in Australia and New Zealand, that had measurable impacts on conditions of interest were included. The search yielded 16 articles and reports and were classified as producer impact and/or processor impact studies. Mortalities were quantified for pneumonia and arthritis, with pneumonia having the highest impact for producers. Grass seed infestation resulted in the highest impact on carcase and liveweight losses compared to arthritis and pneumonia. Arthritis had the highest trim weight losses for both lamb and mutton and the highest rate of carcase condemnation. Grass seed was the only condition where other impacts on the processor (chain speed and staff relocation to the boning room) were quantified. Although quantifiable production and processing losses were available for some conditions, this review has highlighted that limited quantifiable data based on scientifically sound research were not available for other conditions. The evidence for some conditions found in this review can be used to target future research activities and to further assist producers in making informed management decisions on prevention and control.},

	abstract = {A growing body of evidence has shown that extracellular vesicles can be efficient as experimental therapeutics in pre-clinical models of skin wounds, but there is a significant unmet need to translate this to clinical utilization. The objectives of the current systematic review were to identify the strength of the therapeutic effects of EVs derived from stem cells in cutaneous wounds and to assess which EV-mediated mechanisms could be involved in the therapeutic response. PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Scopus databases were systematically searched. We retrieved English-language articles published through June 2020. In vivo studies which applied stem cell-derived EVs were included for further analysis. The Risk of bias was assessed by the SYRCLE tool. We identified thirty-nine pre-clinical studies that evaluated the effects of EVs on the wound healing process. The included studies varied greatly in EVs isolation techniques, route of administration, EVs producing cells, and follow-up time. In vivo application revealed beneficial effects of EVs on accelerating wound closure and re-epithelialization in a dose-dependent manner. Elevated angiogenesis was reported in twelve eligible studies through multiple signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK, and JAK/STAT. The well-known signaling pathway to inhibit scar formation was TGF-β2/SMAD2. However, all included studies were not blinded enough which may have introduced bias. Therefore, the transition of EV's efficacy into the clinics is deeply rooted in the following important factors: 1) pre-clinical studies with a lower risk of bias and longer follow-up time, and 2) consistent, reproducible, and feasible manufacturing of EVs production in a large-scale commercial program.},

This is a systematic review of epidemiological studies evaluating the association between exposure to cats and occurrence of VL in humans (HVL) or dogs (CVL). Among the six studies addressing CVL, one showed a higher chance of CVL in the presence of cats, one showed an inverse relationship between the presence of cats and CVL, and four were inconclusive. Among the four studies evaluating HVL, three were inconclusive, and one showed an association between the presence of cats and HVL among patients with renal transplantation. The inconsistency of the results, associated to the methodological weaknesses of the studies analyzed, does not allow a firm conclusion that there is co-occurrence between exposure to cats and VL. Methodologically robust studies should be performed to elucidate the role of cats in VL transmission.},

The novel immune suppressant, fingolimod, is a promising candidate to ameliorate stroke-induced damage. Fingolimod is efficacious in experimental ischemic models, but a rigorous meta-analysis is lacking that considers how different experiment variables affect outcomes.Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review of fingolimod in stroke models, with the aim of rigorously evaluating fingolimod's effects on reducing infarct volume improving neurological outcomes. Seventeen variables were evaluated as covariates for the source of heterogeneity, and effect sizes were combined by using normalized mean difference meta-analysis to evaluate efficacy. Study quality was evaluated by the CAMARADES ten-item checklist, and publication bias was evaluated by funnel plots and Egger's tests.Results: About 123 unduplicated articles were identified in the literature research. Of these papers, 118 articles were excluded after reading titles and abstracts. Another 17 articles were selected in this study. Study quality was moderate (median = 6; interquartile range = 4), and publication bias was statistically insignificant. fingolimod reduced infarct volume by 30.4\% (95\% CI 22.4\%-38.3\%; n = 24; I(2) = 90.0\%; p {\textless} 0.0001) and consistently enhanced neurobehavioral outcome by 34.2\% (95\% CI 23.1\%-45.2\%; n = 14; I(2) = 76.5\%; p {\textless} 0.0001). No single factors accounted for heterogeneity.Conclusions: Our rigorous statistical evaluation confirmed the neuroprotective properties of fingolimod.

	abstract = {Background: A number of randomised in vivo trials have to date investigated the health impacts of the genetic variants A1 and A2 of bovine beta-casein. The primary difference between these two genetic variants is the mutation leading to an amino acid exchange at a position 67 in the peptide chain. This systematic review evaluated the effects of bovine milk, beta-casein and pure beta-casomorphin7, in the form of orally administered nutritional ingredients, on possible incidence and risk for chronic digestive discomfort and development of incurable conditions and diseases in human and animal randomised controlled trials.; Scope and approach: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist, searches were performed for publications across 7 electronic databases (Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, EBSCO, PubMed, and Cochrane) up to and until July 2020, to identify randomised controlled trials. The subsequent search results were screened for relevance firstly by title, then abstract, and the chosen ones by full text, with additional screening of included articles reference lists.; Key findings and conclusions: In total 2006 peer-reviewed journal articles were identified and after applying exclusion criteria, 19 studies were deemed suitable for inclusion. Human-based and animal-based results from the clinical in vivo studies demonstrated that consumption of A2 beta-casein milk can lead to improved tolerance of milk via decline in the ubiquity of gut related discomfort. However, the exact mechanism for these effects or specific individuals that may benefit from A2 beta-casein milk as opposed to A1 beta-casein milk is still poorly understood. Notably, consumption of A2 beta-casein milk had very low to completely no effect on the other health statuses investigated, particularly non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and diabetes. Based on current data, there is not sufficient evidence to merit public health authority recommendations related to the consumption and health associations of A1 beta-casein milk or A2 beta-casein milk. Interestingly, regardless of the scientific evidence between A2 beta-casein milk and health, this milk continues to gain prominence on the market, thus further functional research is required to understand the mechanisms of action of these identified peptides and gene variants and any implications A1 or A2 beta-casein milk may have on human health and techno-functional properties of milks.},

After compilation of relevant scientific publications available from the literature between 1990 and 2016, and applying exclusion and inclusion criteria, meta-analyses of data from dairy and beef cattle were applied for the pooled dataset or for each animal category (dairy or beef). The results of meta-analysis of all three datasets (all cattle, dairy cattle, or beef cattle) suggested that effect size of yeast either on daily CH(4) production or on CH(4) production per dry matter intake (CH(4)/DMI) was not significant. The results of Q test and I(2) statistic suggest that there is no heterogeneity between different studies on CH(4) production and CH(4)/DMI. The results of meta-analysis suggest that use of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) as feed additive does not offer significant results in terms of reduction of CH(4) production in dairy and beef cattle. Further research on the effects of different doses of yeast, use of yeast products, different strains, and experimental designs is warranted to elucidate the effects of yeasts on methane production in the rumen.},

In this regard, some databases such as Scopus, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were screened in order to retrieve the related citations from 1 January 1983 to 10 September 2019. The pooled prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. was calculated by using a random effect model (REM) based on defined subgroups, including countries, water type, treatment conditions (treated and untreated), economic condition, World Health Organization (WHO) regions, and method of detection. In contrast, this index for treated and untreated water was 25.7\% and 40.1\%, respectively. Also, the overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. among all water types was defined as 36 (95\% CI: 31.4-40.7). The rank order of prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. based on water type was wastewater (46.9\%) {\textgreater} surface water (45.3\%) {\textgreater} raw water (31.6\%) {\textgreater} drinking water (25.5\%) {\textgreater} reservoirs water (24.5\%) {\textgreater} groundwater (18.8\%) {\textgreater} swimming pool water (7.5\%) {\textgreater} marine water (0.20\%).

	abstract = {Resveratrol (RSV) has been reported to have potential beneficial effects in the complicated pregnancy. Various pregnancy complications lead to a suboptimal in utero environment that impacts fetal growth during critical windows of development. Detrimental structural changes to key organ systems in utero persist into adult life and predispose offspring to an increased risk of chronic non-communicable metabolic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the effect of gestational RSV exposure on both maternal and fetal outcomes. Publicly available databases (n = 8) were searched for original studies reporting maternal and/or fetal outcomes after RSV exposure during pregnancy irrespective of species. Of the 115 studies screened, 31 studies were included in this review. RSV exposure occurred for different durations across a range of species (Rats n = 18, Mice n = 7, Japanese Macaques n = 3 and Sheep n = 3), models of complicated pregnancy (eg. maternal dietary manipulations, gestational diabetes, maternal hypoxia, teratogen exposure, etc.), dosages and administration routes. Maternal and fetal outcomes differed not only based on the model of complicated pregnancy assessed but also as a result of species. Given the heterogenic nature of these studies, further investigation assessing RSV exposure during the complicated pregnancy is warranted. In order to make an informed decision regarding the use of RSV to intervene in pregnancy complications, we suggest a minimum data set for consideration in future studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in humans in 2012. A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize current knowledge and identify critical knowledge gaps. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review on MERS-CoV using PRISMA guidelines. We identified 407 relevant, peer-reviewed publications and selected 208 of these based on their contributions to four key areas: virology; clinical characteristics, outcomes, therapeutic and preventive options; epidemiology and transmission; and animal interface and the search for natural hosts of MERS-CoV. RESULTS: Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4/CD26) was identified as the human receptor for MERS-CoV, and a variety of molecular and serological assays developed. Dromedary camels remain the only documented zoonotic source of human infection, but MERS-like CoVs have been detected in bat species globally, as well as in dromedary camels throughout the Middle East and Africa. However, despite evidence of camel-to-human MERS-CoV transmission and cases apparently related to camel contact, the source of many primary cases remains unknown. There have been sustained health care-associated human outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and South Korea, the latter originating from one traveler returning from the Middle East. Transmission mechanisms are poorly understood; for health care, this may include environmental contamination. Various potential therapeutics have been identified, but not yet evaluated in human clinical trials. At least one candidate vaccine has progressed to Phase I trials. CONCLUSIONS: There has been substantial MERS-CoV research since 2012, but significant knowledge gaps persist, especially in epidemiology and natural history of the infection. There have been few rigorous studies of baseline prevalence, transmission, and spectrum of disease. Terms such as "camel exposure" and the epidemiological relationships of cases should be clearly defined and standardized. We strongly recommend a shared and accessible registry or database. Coronaviruses will likely continue to emerge, arguing for a unified "One Health" approach.},

	abstract = {Background: Arbovirus infections have steadily become a major pandemic threat. This study aimed at investigating the existence of host epigenetic markers arising from the principal arboviruses infections impacting on human health. We set to systematically review all published evidence describing any epigenetic modifications associated with infections from arboviruses, including, but not limited to, microRNAs, DNA methylation, and histone modifications. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, Science Direct and Cochrane Library from inception to January 4th, 2018. We included reports describing original in vivo or in vitro studies investigating epigenetic changes related to arbovirus infections in either clinical subjects or human cell lines. Studies investigating epigenetic modifications related to the virus or the arthropod vector were excluded. A narrative synthesis of the findings was conducted, contextualizing comparative evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies. Results: A total of 853 unique references were identified and screened by two independent researchers. Thirty-two studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. The evidence was centered mainly on microRNA and DNA methylation signatures implicated with secondary Dengue fever. Evidence for recent epidemic threats, such as the infections by Zika or Chikungunya viruses is still scant. Conclusions: Major epigenetic alterations found on arboviruses infections were miR-146, miR-30e and the Dicer complex. However, existing studies frequently tested distinct hypotheses resulting in a heterogeneity of methodological approaches. Whilst epigenetic signatures associated with arbovirus infections have been reported, existing studies have largely focused on a small number of diseases, particularly dengue. Validation of epigenetic signatures have an untapped potential, but concerted investigations are certainly required to deliver robust candidates of clinical utility for diagnosis, staging and prognosis of specific arboviral diseases.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles were selected from Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, LILACS-Bireme, and BBO electronic databases using keywords obtained from Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). Of 1540 potentially eligible studies, 157 were selected for full text analysis. Five independent reviewers (Kappa = 0.89) selected the studies, abstracted information, and assessed quality based on standardized scales. After the analysis, 78 studies comparing bovine teeth to human teeth were found. Only 18 studies comparing bovine and human substrates in bond strength tests were included in the systematic review and 13 in the meta-analysis. Two authors independently selected the studies, extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. Mean differences were obtained by comparing tensile and shear bond strengths between human and bovine teeth (permanent and deciduous) and considering enamel and dentin separately (subgroup analysis). Statistical analysis was performed using RevMan5.1, with a random-effect model, at a 5\% significance level. RESULTS: No significant difference was found between human and bovine teeth in tensile tests (p = 0.41) for dentin (p = 0.86), but there was a difference for enamel (p = 0.01). Regarding shear bond strength, no significant difference was found between human and bovine teeth (p = 0.16) either for enamel (p = 0.07) or dentin (p = 0.68). Regarding shear bond strength on deciduous teeth, no significant difference was found between human and bovine substrates (p = 0.54), either for enamel (p = 0.42) or dentin (p = 0.05). Most studies were at high (low or unclear) risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: In shear bond strength testing, bovine teeth can be a suitable alternative for permanent and deciduous human teeth, for both enamel and dentin substrates. However, they may not be suitable for enamel tensile bond strength testing. The findings are based on low quality studies (considerable heterogeneity) and should be interpreted with caution.},

	abstract = {In recent years, new genome editing technologies have emerged that can edit the genome of non-human animals with progressively increasing efficiency. Despite ongoing academic debate about the ethical implications of these technologies, no comprehensive overview of this debate exists. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a systematic review of the reasons reported in the academic literature for and against the development and use of genome editing technologies in animals. Most included articles were written by academics from the biomedical or animal sciences. The reported reasons related to seven themes: human health, efficiency, risks and uncertainty, animal welfare, animal dignity, environmental considerations and public acceptability. Our findings illuminate several key considerations about the academic debate, including a low disciplinary diversity in the contributing academics, a scarcity of systematic comparisons of potential consequences of using these technologies, an underrepresentation of animal interests, and a disjunction between the public and academic debate on this topic. As such, this article can be considered a call for a broad range of academics to get increasingly involved in the discussion about genome editing, to incorporate animal interests and systematic comparisons, and to further discuss the aims and methods of public involvement.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subfebrile temperatures and fever in the first days after stroke are associated with a greater risk of a poor outcome. If this relation is causal, prevention of hyperthermia may improve outcome. Causality can be tested in animal models. We therefore assessed the effects of hyperthermia on outcomes in animal models of ischaemic stroke and explored under which conditions prevention of hyperthermia could be most effective. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from animal experiments testing the effect of spontaneous or induced hyperthermia on outcome after focal cerebral ischaemia. Our primary outcome measure was infarct size. Normalised mean differences were combined using the random effects model and stratified meta-analysis was used to explore the impact of study characteristics. RESULTS: We included 19 publications, reporting on 49 comparisons involving 603 animals. Overall, hyperthermia increased infarct size by 43.4\% (95\% confidence interval, 29.8-56.9\%) and worsened neurobehavioral outcomes by 48.5\% (17.2-79.8\%). The increase in infarct size was larger with higher temperatures. Hyperthermia was most harmful if present for more than 2 h and when started at the time of artery occlusion rather than later. CONCLUSION: Hyperthermia substantially increased infarct size in animal models of ischaemic stroke, suggesting that the relation between fever and poor outcome observed in patients is at least in part causal. These data provide support to trials testing the effect of the prevention of fever with antipyretic drugs in patients with acute stroke.},

	abstract = {The influence of physical exercise on brain antioxidant defense mechanisms has been studied. Nevertheless, the effect of training volume on the brain`s redox balance remains unclear. In this meta-analysis, we compared the effect of training volume on antioxidant enzymatic resource and lipid peroxidation on various brain regions. The activities of the enzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were also evaluated. The effects of training periods (weeks) and exercise duration were compared. Meta-analysis revealed that protocols over 8 weeks were associated with an increase in SOD (p =  0.0008) and CAT activities (p =  0.0001). Exercise durations for 30 and 60 min were associated with higher CAT activity (p =  0.04). Joint analysis revealed that moderate physical exercise over 4 and 8 weeks promoted a healthy enzymatic balance. However, high volumes of exercise over 8 weeks were associated with the increased antioxidant enzymatic activity, indicating higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The data also indicated that there is still limited research and inaccurate information, on the safety conditions of training periods that simulate tests of ultra resistance in humans.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The choice of the most suitable litter treatment should be based on scientific evidence. This systematic review assessed the effectiveness of litter treatments on ammonia concentration, pH, moisture and pathogenic microbiota of the litter and their effects on body weight, feed intake, feed conversion and mortality of broilers. METHODS: The systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed (Medline), Google Scholar, ScienceDirect and Scielo databases to retrieve articles published from January 1998 to august 2019. Means, standard deviations and sample sizes were extracted from each study. The response variables were analyzed using the mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD), (litter treatment minus control group). All variables were analyzed using random effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: Subgroup meta-analysis revealed that acidifiers reduce pH (P{\textless}0.001), moisture (P = 0.002) ammonia (P = 0.011) and pathogenic microbiota (P {\textless}0.001) of the litter and improves the weight gain (P = 0.019) and decreases the mortality rate of broilers (P{\textless}0.001) when compared with controls. Gypsum had a positive effect on ammonia reduction (P = 0.012) and improved feed conversion (P = 0.023). Alkalizing agents raise the pH (P = 0.035), worsen feed conversion (P{\textless}0.001), increase the mortality rate (P {\textless}0.001), decrease the moisture content (P{\textless}0.001) and reduce the pathogenic microbiota of the litter (P{\textless}0.001) once compared to controls. Superphosphate and adsorbents reduce, respectively, pH (P{\textless}0.001) and moisture (P = 0.007) of the litter compared to control groups. CONCLUSION: None of the litter treatments influenced the feed intake of broilers. Meta-analyses of the selected studies showed positive and significant effects of the litter treatments on broiler performance and litter quality when compared with controls. Alkalizing was associated with worse feed conversion and high mortality of broilers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: National pediatric vaccination programs have been introduced in Latin America (LatAm) to reduce the burden of diseases due to pathogens such as rotavirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and pneumococcus. Vaccination health benefits may extend to unvaccinated populations by reducing pathogen transmission. Understanding herd effect is important for implementation and assessment of vaccination programs. The objective was to conduct a systematic review of published epidemiological evidence of herd effect with Hib, rotavirus and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) in LatAm. METHODS: Searches were conducted in PubMed, Virtual Health Library (VHL), SciELO and SCOPUS databases, for studies reporting data on herd effect from Hib, rotavirus and PCV vaccination in LatAm, without age restriction. Searches were limited to articles published in English, Spanish or Portuguese (1990-2016). After screening and full-text review, articles meeting the selection criteria were included to be critically appraised following criteria for observational and interventional studies. The presence of a herd effect was defined as a significant decrease in incidence of disease, hospitalization, or mortality. RESULTS: 3,465 unique articles were identified, and 23 were included (Hib vaccine n = 5, PCV n = 8, rotavirus vaccine n = 10). Most studies included children and/or adolescents (age range varied between studies). Studies in adults, including older adults (aged {\textgreater} 65 years), were limited. Few studies reported statistically significant reductions in disease incidence in age groups not targeted for vaccination. Hib-confirmed meningitis hospitalization decreased in children but herd effect could not be quantified. Some evidence of herd effect was identified for PCV and rotavirus vaccine in unvaccinated children. Evidence for herd effects due to PCV in adults was limited. CONCLUSION: After introduction of Hib, PCV and rotavirus vaccination in LatAm, reductions in morbidity/mortality have been reported in children not targeted for vaccination. However, due to methodological limitations (e.g. short post-vaccination periods and age range studied), there is currently insufficient evidence to quantify the herd effect in adult populations. More research and higher quality surveillance is needed to characterize herd effect of these vaccines in LatAm.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: It is unclear if anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction can prevent the onset of degenerative changes in the knee. Previous studies were inconclusive on this subject. The aim of this study was to systematically review all studies on the effect of ACL reconstruction on articular cartilage in animals. DESIGN: Pubmed and Embase were searched to identify all original articles concerning the effect of ACL reconstruction on articular cartilage compared with both its positive (ACL transection) and negative (sham and/or non-operated) control in animals. Subsequently a Risk of bias and meta analysis was conducted based on five outcomes (gross macroscopic assessment, medical imaging, histological histochemical grading, histomophometrics and biomechanical characterization) related to articular cartilage. RESULTS: From the 19 included studies, 29 independent comparisons could be identified which underwent ACL reconstruction with an average timing of data collection of 23 weeks (range 1-104 weeks). Due to limited data availability meta-analysis could only be conducted for gross macroscopic damage. ACL reconstruction caused significant gross macroscopic damage compared with intact controls (SMD 2.0 [0.88; 3.13]). These findings were supported by individual studies reporting on histomorphometrics, histology and imaging. No significant gross macroscopic damage was found when ACL reconstruction was compared with ACL transection (SMD -0.64 [-1.85; 0.57]). CONCLUSION: This systematic review with an average follow up of included studies of 23 weeks (range 1-104 weeks) demonstrates that, in animals, ACL reconstruction does not protect articular cartilage from degenerative changes. The consistency of the direction of effect, provides some reassurance that the direction of effect in humans might be the same.},

The aim of this study was to conduct a review on VBD interventions relevant to housing and hygiene (including sanitation and waste management) in urban areas. Main body: We conducted a scoping review, which involved systematically searching peer-reviewed and grey literature published between 2000 and 2016 using five scientific databases and one database for grey literature. Different data extraction tools were used for data coding and extraction. We assessed the quality of each study using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and extracted descriptive characteristics and data about implementation process and transferability from all studies using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication and ASTAIRE (a tool for analyzing the transferability of health promotion interventions) tools. We reviewed 44 studies. Overall, the studies were judged to be of high risk for bias. Our results suggest multifaceted interventions, particularly community-based interventions, have the potential to achieve wider and more sustained effects than do standard vertical single-component programs. The evaluations of multifaceted interventions tend to include integrated evaluations, using not only entomological indicators but also acceptability and sustainability indicators. Conclusions: This review highlighted the important need for higher quality research in VBDs and improved and standardized reporting of interventions. Significant research gaps were found regarding qualitative research and implementation research, and results highlighted the need for more interventions focus on sanitation and hygiene practices.},

Historical research models have provided insights into the underlying causes of these diseases but come with many limitations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature regarding the advantage of organoid models in modeling benign and malignant colorectal pathology. DATA SOURCES: Sources included PubMed, Ovid-Medline, and Ovid Embase STUDY SELECTION:: Two reviewers completed a systematic review of the literature between January 2006 and January of 2020 for studies related to colon and intestinal organoids. Reviews, commentaries, protocols, and studies not performed in humans or mice were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 73 articles were included. Organoid models of colorectal disease have been rising in popularity to further elucidate the genetic, transcriptomic, and treatment response of these diseases at the individual level. Increasingly complex models utilizing coculture techniques are being rapidly developed that allow in vitro recapitulation of the disease microenvironment. LIMITATIONS: This review is only qualitative, and the lack of well utilized nomenclature in the organoid community may have resulted in the exclusion of articles. CONCLUSIONS: Historical disease models including cell lines, patient-derived tumor xenografts, and animal models have created a strong foundation for our understanding of colorectal pathology. Recent advances in 3-dimensional cell cultures, in the form of patient-derived epithelial organoids and induced human intestinal organoids have opened a new avenue for high-resolution analysis of pathology at the level of an individual patient. Recent research has shown the potential of organoids as a tool for personalized medicine with their ability to retain patient characteristics, including treatment response.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To perform a systematic literature review of the regenerative potential of bone substitutes used to fill critical size defects (CSDs) in rabbit calvariae; to determine the quality of the included studies using ARRIVE guidelines. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An Internet search was performed in duplicate using MEDLINE, PubMed and Google Scholar databases (without restrictions on publication date) for studies reporting the regenerative potential of bone substitutes in CSDs in rabbit calvariae. Four parameters were analyzed by histomorphometry: new bone formation (NB); defect closure (DC); residual graft (RG); and connective tissue (CT). Animal Research Reporting in In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines (a list of 20 aspects for scoring texts and ensuring comparison between different experimental studies in animals) were used to evaluate the quality of the selected works. RESULTS: Twenty-one manuscripts were included. CSDs with 15 mm were predominant (57.14\%). Only one study described the four histomorphometric parameters. NB formation was analyzed in 15 studies (71.42\%) and was higher for particulate autogenous bone grafts (range 52.1-82\%) after 12 weeks. DC was evaluated in six studies (28.57\%) and was higher for fragmented adipose tissue grafts (range 53.33-93.33\%) after 12 weeks. RG was evaluated in four studies (19.04\%) and was higher for hydroxyapatite/beta-tricalcium phosphate grafts with silica (HA/ß-TCP + Si) (range 35.78-47.54\%) at 12 weeks. CT was evaluated in two studies (9.5\%) and was higher for HA/ß-TCP + membrane (44.2\%) at 12 weeks. Quality evaluation identified three items (title, introduction/objectives and experimental procedure) (15\%) with excellent scores, 10 items (abstract, introduction/background, methods/ethical statement, experimental animals, experimental outcomes, statistics, results/baseline data, outcome/estimation and discussion interpretation/scientific implications) (50\%) with average scores, and seven items (housing and husbandry, sample size, allocation, numbers analyzed, adverse effects, general applicability/relevance and funding) (35\%) obtained poor scores. Only one manuscript obtained a quality evaluation considered as excellent. CONCLUSIONS: Autogenous bone grafts increase NB. DC is enhanced by the use of fragmented adipose tissue. RG remains in the defect for longer when hydroxyapatite/beta-tricalcium phosphate with silica is used, and more CT can be expected when hydroxyapatite/beta-tricalcium phosphate with silica grafts are covered by a membrane. The addition of stem cells of different origins to grafting materials enhances bone formation in early healing periods. The ARRIVE guidelines are still insufficiently used and the overall quality of studies remains low.},

A total of 272 eligible publications were identified from Medline, Scopus, Embase and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. Apparent and true seroprevalence were analysed by region using a novel Bayesian hierarchical model that allowed incorporating sensitivity and specificity of the applied serological assays. The true seroprevalence of T. gondii in pregnant women was 5.0\% or less in seven regions of China. The median of the regional true seroprevalences in pigs (24\%) was significantly higher than in cattle (9.5\%), but it was not significantly higher than in chickens (20\%) and small ruminants (20\%). This study represents the first use of a Bayesian hierarchical model to obtain regional true seroprevalence.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis, caused by Schistosoma japonicum, remains one of the most important parasitic diseases, and detection of S. japonicum infections in humans plays a crucial role in control and treatment. However, comparisons between the parasitological and the immunological examinations in the fields of China are lacking. Therefore we performed a meta-analysis to compare the seroprevalence of Schistosoma japonicum, as determined by IHA or ELISA, with coprological prevalence, as determined by Kato-Katz, and estimate the ratio of the serological to the egg-positive prevalence in order to evaluate the potential threat of egg-negative but worm-positive schistosomiasis. METHODS: Studies published up to July 2018 on the parasitological and immunological examinations of schistosomiasis in the fields of China were searched in five databases including CNKI, WanFang, VIP, PubMed and Web of Science. The ratio of the serological to the egg-positive prevalence and its 95\%CI for each study were calculated, and then point estimates and their 95\%CIs of pooled prevalence ratio were meta-analyzed. Subgroup meta-analyses were also performed according to potential influential factors. RESULTS: A total of 23 articles were included. The prevalence ratio varied from 0.57 to 48.83 for IHA to Kato-Katz and ranged from 0.38 to 13.97 for ELISA to Kato-Katz. The pooled ratio was 4.72 (95\%CI: 3.87{\textasciitilde} 5.76) for IHA to KK and 4.65 (95\%CI: 3.50{\textasciitilde} 6.17) for ELISA to KK. Subgroup analyses implied that the ratio of the serological to the egg-positive prevalence may decrease with the endemic levels. The highest prevalence ratio was observed when Kato-Katz was performed with three slides per stool or in hilly and mountainous regions. CONCLUSIONS: The worm-determined prevalence by IHA or ELISA is 4- to 5-fold higher than the egg-determined prevalence by Kato-Katz, which implied Kato-Katz may largely underestimate the prevalence of S. japonicum in China. The degree of underestimation was greater when Kato-Katz with three slides per stool was carried out, especially in low endemic areas or in hilly and mountainous regions. Therefore, more attention should be paid to those egg-negative but worm-positive patients with the aim of final elimination of S. japonicum in China.},

	abstract = {Understanding and quantifying the risk of Hansen's disease (HD) through zoonotic transmission of Mycobacterium leprae infection from wild armadillos is important because hunting, handling and consumption of these animals is widespread in communities where HD is endemic, posing a potential threat to the health of individuals and to HD elimination. We conducted a systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42019159891) of publications in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, Scopus, LILACS, Biblioteca Digital Brasileira de Teses e Dissertações, Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações de CAPES, and Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde up to 09/05/2020 using Mesh and text terms in English, Portuguese, Spanish and French. Random effects meta-analyses were performed including of subgroups by endemicity and type of exposure. Seven of the nine included studies were case-control, four from Brazil and three from the USA, comprising 1,124 cases and 2,023 controls in total. The other two studies, one from Brazil and one from Colombia, were cross-sectional. The overall summary estimate (odds ratio, OR) for the relative odds of HD comparing people who had direct contact with armadillos and/or had eaten armadillo meat with those who had not was OR = 2.60 (95\% CI 1.78-3.80, p {\textless} .001) with a predictive interval of OR = 1.10-6.17. Summary odds ratios for specific exposures were as follows: indirect contact, OR = 1.39 (95\% CI 1.02, 1.89) (p = .04); eating, OR = 2.29 (95\% CI 1.13, 4.66) (p = .02); hunting, OR = 2.54 (95\% CI 1.21, 5.33) (p = .01). Most of the included studies had moderate risk of bias. Crude estimates were reduced by up to 24\% when adjusted for confounders (where reported). Direct contact with wild armadillos was strongly associated with an increased risk of HD, whilst evidence for an increased risk of HD from indirect contact was weaker. The fraction of HD in endemic countries attributable to zoonotic transmission from armadillos remains unknown, but the precautionary principle needs to be adopted to protect public health.},

	abstract = {Understanding the prevalence of M. leprae infection in armadillos is important because of evidence from Brazil and other countries of an association between contact with armadillos and the development of Hansen's Disease (leprosy). Our aim was to characterize studies which have investigated natural M. leprae infection in wild armadillos in Brazil, and to quantify and explore variability in the reported prevalence of infection. We conducted a systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42019155277) of publications in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, Scopus, LILACS, Biblioteca Digital Brasileira de Teses e Dissertações, Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações de CAPES, and Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde up to 10/2019 using Mesh and text search terms (in English, Portuguese, Spanish, and French). The 10 included studies represented a total sample of 302 armadillos comprising 207 (69\%) Dasypus novemcinctus, 67 (22\%) Euphractus sexcinctus, 16 (5\%) Priodontes maximus, 10 (3\%) Cabassous unicinctus, and 2 (1\%) Cabassous tatouay from 7 different states. Methods used included histopathology (4 studies), PGL-1 and LID-1 antigen detection (4 studies) and examination for clinical signs of disease (4 studies). Eight studies used PCR of which 7 targeted the RLEP repetitive element and 3 tested for inhibitory substances. M. leprae prevalence by PCR ranged from 0\% (in 3 studies) to 100\% in one study, with a summary estimate of 9.4\% (95\% CI 0.4\% to 73.1\%) and a predictive interval of 0-100\%. The average prevalence is equivalent to 1 in 10 armadillos in Brazil being infected with M. leprae, but wide variation in sample estimates means that the prevalence in any similar study would be entirely unpredictable. We propose instead that future studies aim to investigate transmission and persistence of M. leprae within and between armadillo populations, meanwhile adopting the precautionary principle to protect human health and an endangered species in Brazil.},

	doi = {10.1111/jre.12566},
	abstract = {Osteoporosis is one of the most common skeletal disorders affecting a significant percentage of people worldwide. Research data suggested that systemic diseases such as osteoporosis could act as risk factors for osseointegration, jeopardizing the healing process and thus the predictability of dental implant success on compromised patients. It is well accepted that preclinical studies in animal models reproducing the osteoporotic condition are one of the most important stages in the research of new biomaterials and therapeutic modalities. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate whether osteoporosis compromises dental implant osseointegration in experimental osteoporotic-like conditions. A 3-stage systematic literature research was conducted in MEDLINE via OVID and EMBASE up to and including March 2017. Experimental studies reporting on dental implant osseointegration on different osteoporotic animal models were assessed. The studies had to report on the percentage of bone-to-implant contact (\%BIC) as the primary outcome. ARRIVE guidelines for reporting on animal research were applied to evaluate the methodological quality and risk of bias of the studies. Fifty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria and were assessed qualitatively. The most adopted animal model was the rat. A variability of \%BIC values was observed, ranging from 30\% to 99\% and from 26\% to 94\% for the healthy and osteoporotic group, respectively. The great majority (47) of the included studies concluded that estrogen deficiency significantly affects BIC values, 9 studies stated that it was not possible to observe statistical differences in BIC between ovariectomized and healthy groups and 1 study did not provide a comparison between the healthy and osteoporotic group. Owing to the great heterogeneity in implant surface, study design, observation time-points, site of implant placement and reported outcomes, a meta-analysis could not be performed. An overall high risk of bias was observed, owing to the limited information on animal housing and husbandry, baseline characteristics and health status, ethical statement and allocation to the experimental groups provided. Although the available studies seem to suggest a lower osseointegration in osteoporotic-like conditions, no robust conclusions can be drawn due to the great heterogeneity and overall low quality of the available studies. Future studies with emphasis on minimizing the possible sources of bias and evaluating osseointegration of dental implants placed into jawbones instead of long bones are warranted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The beef tapeworm, Taenia saginata, causing cysticercosis in bovines and taeniosis in humans, is thought to have a global distribution. In eastern and southern Africa, cattle production plays a crucial role in the economy, but a clear overview of the prevalence of T. saginata in the region is still lacking. This review aims to summarize existing knowledge on T. saginata taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis distribution in eastern and southern Africa. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted, that gathered published and grey literature, including OIE reports, concerning T. saginata taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis in eastern and southern Africa published between January 1st, 1990 and December 31st, 2017. RESULTS: A total of 1232 records were initially retrieved, with 78 full text articles retained for inclusion in the database. Unspecified taeniosis cases were reported for Angola, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, whereas T. saginata taeniosis cases were found for Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The prevalence of taeniosis ranged between 0.2-8.1\% based on microscopy, and between 0.12-19.7\% based on coproAg-ELISA. In Ethiopia, the percentage of tapeworm self-reporting was high (45.0-64.2\%), and a substantial number of anthelmintic treatments were reported to be sold in towns. The presence of bovine cysticercosis was reported in all 27 countries/territories included in the study, except for Rwanda and Somalia, Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Seychelles and Socotra. The prevalence of cysticercosis ranged between 0.02-26.3\% based on meat inspection, and between 6.1-34.9\% based on Ag-ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: Although T. saginata has been reported in the majority of countries/territories of the study area, T. saginata taeniosis/cysticercosis remains a largely ignored condition, probably due to the absence of symptoms in cattle, the lack of data on its economic impact, and the fact that human taeniosis is considered a minor health problem. However, the occurrence of bovine cysticercosis is a clear sign of inadequate sanitation, insufficient meat inspection, and culinary habits that may favour transmission. Measures to reduce transmission of T. saginata are therefore warranted and the infection should be properly monitored.},

Camels play significant role in the livelihood of the pastoralists and agro-pastoralists living in the fragile environments. The main purpose of this meta-analysis was to compute the pooled prevalence estimate of camel trypanosomosis based on the available studies. Published articles on camel trypanosomosis were searched in PubMed, Google scholar and African journals online (AJOL). The key electronic search words were: camel, trypanosomosis, Trypanosoma evansi, and surra. The preliminary screening of the articles was based on the title and abstract. The analysis was based on 11 cross-sectional study reports, which were done between the year 2008 and 2016, and in four administrative regions of Ethiopia. The pooled prevalence estimate in a random effects meta-analysis was 9.2\% (95\% CI 7.1-11.8). Enormous heterogeneity were noted among the studies (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=94.4\%). In subgroup and multivariable meta-regression analyses however, only two predictors namely sample size and diagnostic techniques were found to have significant effect (p{\textless}0.05). Accordingly, the aforementioned predictor sex explained 51.8\% of the explainable proportion of the heterogeneity noted between studies. In this regard, serological and molecular based reports were noted to have higher prevalence compared to wet smear and buffy coat. On the other hand, studies with smaller sample size had less prevalence compared to large sample size. Trypanosoma evansi is the only species identified and reported in all the study reports. This analysis results underscores the need for further study that involve more sensitive diagnostic techniques to reveal the precise magnitude of the disease, and to identify the vectors in all camel rearing areas of the country.},

	abstract = {Leptospirosis is a global zoonotic disease that the transmission is driven by complex geographical and temporal variation in demographics, animal hosts and socioecological factors. This results in complex challenges for the identification of high-risk areas. Spatial and temporal epidemiological tools could be used to support leptospirosis control programs, but the adequacy of its application has not been evaluated. We searched literature in six databases including PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Scopus, SciELO and Zoological Record to systematically review and critically assess the use of spatial and temporal analytical tools for leptospirosis and to provide general framework for its application in future studies. We reviewed 115 articles published between 1930 and October 2018 from 41 different countries. Of these, 65 (56.52\%) articles were on human leptospirosis, 39 (33.91\%) on animal leptospirosis and 11 (9.5\%) used data from both human and animal leptospirosis. Spatial analytical (n = 106) tools were used to describe the distribution of incidence/prevalence at various geographical scales (96.5\%) and to explored spatial patterns to detect clustering and hot spots (33\%). A total of 51 studies modelled the relationships of various variables on the risk of human (n = 31), animal (n = 17) and both human and animal infection (n = 3). Among those modelling studies, few studies had generated spatially structured models and predictive maps of human (n = 2/31) and animal leptospirosis (n = 1/17). In addition, nine studies applied time-series analytical tools to predict leptospirosis incidence. Spatial and temporal analytical tools have been greatly utilized to improve our understanding on leptospirosis epidemiology. Yet the quality of the epidemiological data, the selection of covariates and spatial analytical techniques should be carefully considered in future studies to improve usefulness of evidence as tools to support leptospirosis control. A general framework for the application of spatial analytical tools for leptospirosis was proposed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bovine viral diarrhea is an infectious disease that causes symptoms such as bovine diarrhea and abortion. It can cause severe losses to the animal husbandry, and the overall epidemic situation of yak's BVDV in China is unclear. Meta-analysis can reveal the basic epidemic situation of BVDV in different yak distribution areas in China, and estimate potentially related factors, to pave the way for clarifying the epidemic situation of yak in the domestic scope. METHODS: We proceeded to a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from papers on the BVDV incidence and prevalence in yaks in China by searching PubMed, ScienceDirect, Chinese Web of Knowledge (CNKI), Wanfang, and Chongqing VIP for publication from 1987 to 2019. We excluded reviews and duplicate studies, 24 studies denouncing the prevalence of BVDV in yak in China were selected upon our inclusion criterion finally. We estimated the pooled prevalence of BVDV infection in yaks by a random-effects model and evaluated its overall infection burden in China. FINDINGS: In total, the pooled prevalence of BVDV in yaks in China was 36.0\% (95\% CI 25.6\%-46.4\%) based on the data obtained from 13,446 yaks, by detecting antigens and antibodies. The highest BVDV positive rate in yak reached 67.5\% in Xinjiang province of China. The prevalence in the six provinces of China was validated to be quite variable (24.4\%-67.5\%) and reached 369\% in yaks of northwest China. Besides, the BVDV antigen-positive rate was estimated at 13.8\% (95\% CI 8.6\%-19.0\%) based on 5 studies, comparatively, the pooled BVDV antibody-based on 18 studies was about 32.9\% (95\% CI 24.6\%-41.2\%) in China. INTERPRETATION: This systematic review and meta-analysis firstly established an estimated prevalence of BVDV in yaks in China, as a whole, and estimates potential relevant factors, including geographic location, publication year, age, detection methods, etc., Our findings suggest that the scientific community or decision-makers can formulate corresponding prevention and control plans based on potential risk factors.},

However, their overall efficacy remains uncertain; therefore, the identification of evidence-based management recommendations to manipulate anestrous in goats is important. Electronic databases were searched to retrieve reports on studies using interventions based on hormonal, sociosexual, nutritional, and abiotic factors. Only experimental studies in which a group of anestrous does was treated and compared against an untreated group were included. Estrus, ovulation, and pregnancy were primary outcomes, whereas the onset of estrus after treatment, the ovulation rate, and the number of anovulatory days were secondary outcomes. Odds ratio (OR) and mean differences were used to synthesize pooled data, and random effects models were used to calculate them. Seventy studies involving 3974 goats met the inclusion criteria. Unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment predominated across studies. Pooled data for hormonal, sociosexual, and abiotic interventions showed a significant, though variable, increase in estrus (OR range 7.15-144.80), ovulation (OR range 6.08-56.95), and pregnancy (OR range 3.94-30.8). Hormonal treatments significantly reduced the onset of estrus, whereas abiotic interventions failed to reduce the number of anovulatory days. Secondary outcomes were not assessed in trials using sociosexual approaches. Finally, except for pregnancy, no significant efficacy was observed for studies using nutritional management. In conclusion, reproductive management practices using sociosexual approaches showed the highest efficacy for restoring reproductive activity in anestrous does.},

Dromedary vaccine candidates in the development pipeline are showing hopeful results, but gaps in our understanding of the epidemiology of MERS-CoV in dromedaries must be addressed to design and evaluate potential vaccination strategies. We aim to bring together existing measures of MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels to assess the distribution of infection, highlighting knowledge gaps and implications for animal vaccination. We systematically reviewed the published literature on MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science that reported seroprevalence and/or prevalence of active MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. 60 studies met our eligibility criteria. Qualitative syntheses determined that MERS-CoV seroprevalence increased with age up to 80-100\% in adult dromedaries supporting geographically widespread endemicity of MERS-CoV in dromedaries in both the Arabian Peninsula and countries exporting dromedaries from Africa. The high prevalence of active infection measured in juveniles and at sites where dromedary populations mix should guide further investigation - particularly of dromedary movement - and inform vaccination strategy design and evaluation through mathematical modelling.},

	abstract = {There is increased demand for dairy products worldwide, which is coupled with the realization that consumers want dairy products that are produced in a sustainable and environmentally benign manner. Forage legumes, and white clover (Trifolium repens L.; WC) in particular, have the potential to positively influence the sustainability of pasture-based ruminant production systems. Therefore, there is increased interest in the use of forage legumes because they offer opportunities for sustainable pasture-based production systems. A meta-analysis was undertaken to quantify the milk production response associated with the introduction of WC into perennial ryegrass swards and to investigate the optimal WC content of dairy pastures to increase milk production. Two separate databases were created. In the grass-WC database, papers were selected if they compared milk production of lactating dairy cows grazing perennial ryegrass-WC (GC) swards with that of cows grazing perennial ryegrass-only swards (GO). In the WC-only database, papers were selected if they contained milk production from lactating dairy cows grazing on GC swards with varying levels of WC content. Data from both databases were analyzed using mixed models (PROC MIXED) in SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Within the grass-WC database, where mean sward WC content was 31.6\%, mean daily milk and milk solids yield per cow were increased by 1.4 and 0.12 kg, respectively, whereas milk and milk solids yield per hectare were unaffected when cows grazed GC compared with GO swards. Stocking rate and nitrogen fertilizer application were reduced by 0.25 cows/ha and 81 kg/ha, respectively, on GC swards compared with GO swards. These results highlight the potential of GC production systems to achieve similar levels of production to GO systems but with reduced fertilizer nitrogen inputs, which is beneficial from both an economic and environmental point of view. In the context of increased demand for dairy products, there may be potential to increase the productivity of GC systems by increasing fertilizer nitrogen use to increase stocking rate and carrying capacity while also retaining the benefit of WC inclusion on milk production per cow.},

The goal of this review was to evaluate studies about AAI and its effects on oncological/palliative care patients. METHODS: The search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus and Lilacs databases. The inclusion criteria were original articles that measured quantitatively the health-related outcomes of an AAI on oncological/palliative care patients. RESULTS: Ten studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Benefits related to the AAI were described. Mood, pain perception and quality of life seemed to be the variables that had improvement with the intervention. Due to the small sample sizes/heterogeneous methodologies, additional analyses could not be performed. CONCLUSIONS: AAI can be an important tool for improving psychosocial/physiological parameters in cancer/palliative care patients. Further well designed studies are needed to provide a better knowledge of the AAI benefits in this setting.},

	abstract = {A key aspect of the systematic review process is study evaluation to understand the strengths and weaknesses of individual studies included in the review. The present manuscript describes the process currently being used by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) Program to evaluate animal toxicity studies, illustrated by application to the recent systematic reviews of two phthalates: diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP) and diethyl phthalate (DEP). The IRIS Program uses a domain-based approach that was developed after careful consideration of tools used by others to evaluate experimental animal studies in toxicology and pre-clinical research. Standard practice is to have studies evaluated by at least two independent reviewers for aspects related to reporting quality, risk of bias/internal validity (e.g., randomization, blinding at outcome assessment, methods used to expose animals and assess outcomes, etc.), and sensitivity to identify factors that may limit the ability of a study to detect a true effect. To promote consistency across raters, prompting considerations and example responses are provided to reviewers, and a pilot phase is conducted. The evaluation process is performed separately for each outcome reported in a study, as the utility of a study may vary for different outcomes. Input from subject matter experts is used to identify chemical- and outcome-specific considerations (e.g., lifestage of exposure and outcome assessment when considering reproductive effects) to guide judgments within particular evaluation domains. For each evaluation domain, reviewers reach a consensus on a rating of Good, Adequate, Deficient, or Critically Deficient. These individual domain ratings are then used to determine the overall confidence in the study (High Confidence, Medium Confidence, Low Confidence, or Deficient). Study evaluation results, including the justifications for reviewer judgements, are documented and made publicly available in EPA's version of Health Assessment Workspace Collaborative (HAWC), a free and open source web-based software application.

	abstract = {Brazil is a global agricultural commodity producer and the largest consumer of pesticides. Pesticide use in Brazil comprised 549 280 tons in 2018. In the country, soybean, corn, and sugar cane are extensively produced, which are the most pesticides demanding crops. In the last years, the records of new pesticides were the highest in the historical series. They can persist in soil or water, accumulate in organisms, and contaminate workers and the general population through the air, water, or food. This review aimed to gather toxicological data obtained by animal models exposed to 4 pesticides: glyphosate, chlorpyrifos, abamectin, and 2,4-D. An additional goal was to compose an overview of how this subject has been approached, surveying which research groups are working on this field, where they are located, and relations with pesticides used in those regions. We collected the papers from the platforms PubMed, Scopus, Scielo, and Web of Science, performed in Brazil from 2014 to 2019. After two-step blind selection using the software Rayyan QCRI by different authors, 67 studies were selected to extract data. We observed that research is more concentrated in the South region, followed by the Southeast and Midwest, with 43\%, 32\%, and 23\% of the studies, respectively. The prevalent institutions are from the states of Rio Grande do Sul, São Paulo, and Goiás. The effects on a variety of biomarkers help predict the potential risks to humans and nontarget organisms. The prevalent animal model was fish (36\%). Overall, the main toxic effects evaluated were mortality, abnormalities in the blood cells, developmental abnormalities, and behavior alterations.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cestode Taenia solium causes the neglected (zoonotic) tropical disease cysticercosis, a leading cause of preventable epilepsy in endemic low and middle-income countries. Transmission models can inform current scaling-up of control efforts by helping to identify, validate and optimise control and elimination strategies as proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A systematic literature search was conducted using the PRISMA approach to identify and compare existing T. solium transmission models, and related Taeniidae infection transmission models. In total, 28 modelling papers were identified, of which four modelled T. solium exclusively. Different modelling approaches for T. solium included deterministic, Reed-Frost, individual-based, decision-tree, and conceptual frameworks. Simulated interventions across models agreed on the importance of coverage for impactful effectiveness to be achieved. Other Taeniidae infection transmission models comprised force-of-infection (FoI), population-based (mainly Echinococcus granulosus) and individual-based (mainly E. multilocularis) modelling approaches. Spatial structure has also been incorporated (E. multilocularis and Taenia ovis) in recognition of spatial aggregation of parasite eggs in the environment and movement of wild animal host populations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Gaps identified from examining the wider Taeniidae family models highlighted the potential role of FoI modelling to inform model parameterisation, as well as the need for spatial modelling and suitable structuring of interventions as key areas for future T. solium model development. We conclude that working with field partners to address data gaps and conducting cross-model validation with baseline and longitudinal data will be critical to building consensus-led and epidemiological setting-appropriate intervention strategies to help fulfil the WHO targets.},

Many studies on vaccination have been performed previously, and micronemal proteins (MICs) have crucial importance in this regard. The current review aims to reveal the efficiency of MICs as target antigen, adjuvants, animal models (species/strain), T. gondii strains for challenge infection, and routes of vaccine to prevent Toxoplasma infection. A comprehensive literature search was performed on April 18, 2018, in several known databases. Studies were included when evaluating vaccines based on MIC against T. gondii compared to that of a control group. Two independent researchers done the search process, study choice, and data extraction. A total of 28 articles published were selected for further analysis. Among them, 57.03\% of the studies focused on MIC3 and its epitopes. SAG1 was further used in cocktail vaccines compared to other antigens. GM-CSF and Freund's complete were the predominant adjuvants used. BALB/c mice have been introduced as a proper model for lethal challenge. Virulent T. gondii (RH) was utilized more than other strains for challenge. Among MICs, the results of vaccination with MIC1-4, MIC6, and PLP1 demonstrated significantly strong humoral and cellular immunity, increased survival time, and reduced cyst burden in the mice. This review summarizes the latest results on MIC-based vaccines and presents that the most effective vaccination procedure is the administration of the cocktail vaccines. Our survey can serve as a basis for further studies to develop more efficient novel vaccines against T. gondii for animals and humans.},

	abstract = {Freshwater snails, as the first intermediate hosts of trematodes, can cause health hazards in animals and humans. Recently, the World Health Organization has included Iran in a list of 6 countries known to have serious problems with fascioliasis. In addition, cercarial dermatitis is a job-related disease that is seen often in paddy workers, agricultural labourers, and fishermen in Iran, particularly in Mazandaran Province. Many studies have been conducted in Iran to survey larval trematodes in freshwater snails. However, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive data exist regarding infections in gastropods. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to estimate the types and prevalence of cercarial infections in snails in Iran. Electronic English-language and Persian-language databases were searched to identify 24 published articles reporting the prevalence of trematode infections in snails (9 species from 6 families) in various provinces of Iran. In total, 4.4\% of gastropods were infected with the larval stages of trematodes. According to the studies reviewed in this meta-analysis' the highest infection prevalence was found in Radix auricularia (9.9\%). Twelve larval species of trematodes were identified, and the highest prevalence of cercariae was found for Echinostomatidae cercariae (4.3\%). Among the provinces explored, West Azerbaijan had the highest prevalence of infected snails (16.9\%). The presence of trematodes in snails could pose a serious health problem in Iran. Thus, further studies are necessary to characterize these infections in other provinces.},

	abstract = {Quality of life (QoL) is an important parameter to assess in cats, as it can be pivotal to important decision-making. Research reports that owners of cats with heart disease would trade longevity for QoL, and treatment associated improvement in QoL is very important for cats with chronic kidney disease. This systematic review aimed to explore the published literature to identify the number and range of QoL assessment tools available to researchers and veterinary professionals, by discovering tools which have already been used in published studies. Medline and CAB Abstracts were searched in March 2018, using terms relevant to cats and QoL or well-being. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and information on uniqueness, validation and a short description of each tool extracted. A total of 1138 manuscripts were identified, of which 96 met all criteria. Forty of 96 manuscripts contained an assessment of QoL, using one of 32 unique tools identified. Sixteen of the tools identified were structured, making detailed patient assessments. Only eight of the structured tools were validated, and of these, three could be applied to healthy cats; the remainder being specific to a disease or being hospitalised. Some validated tools appeared in more than one manuscript. Overall, 12 manuscripts used a validated tool. In the 16 unstructured tools, five tools assessed QoL by assigning a single word (e.g. 'poor'). Eight tools assessed QoL on a single Likert scale (e.g. a number between 1 and 5). This work identifies the tools that are currently available for the assessment of QoL by researchers and veterinary professionals. Additionally, it demonstrates that many are not validated or lack detailed animal assessment, highlighting that further work in this important area is needed.},

We searched articles published in indexed journals using the keywords: "Mycobacterium bovis," "wild," and "animals". After applying the keywords using online databases, during March and August of 2018, we found 12 articles which encompassed 15 species of wild animals, of which three consisted of wild ruminants. The evidence showed that M. bovis is present among the wild animals in the Americas. The methodological limitations for diagnosing M. bovis in wild animals are many, demanding the development of new and more precise tools. Furthermore, new researches are needed to elucidate the role of the wild animals in the epidemiology of M. bovis and its possible impact on production animals and public health.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence of analgesic efficacy of tramadol for the management of postoperative pain and the presence of associated adverse events in dogs. DATABASES USED: A comprehensive search using PubMed/MEDLINE, LILACS, Google Scholar and CAB databases with no restrictions on language and following a prespecified protocol was performed from June 2019 to July 2020. Included were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) performed in dogs that had undergone general anesthesia for any type of surgery. Two authors independently classified the studies, extracted data and assessed their risk of bias using Cochrane's tool. RevMan and GRADE methods were used to rate the certainty of evidence (CoE). CONCLUSIONS: Overall 26 RCTs involving 848 dogs were included. Tramadol administration probably results in a lower need for rescue analgesia versus no treatment or placebo [moderate CoE; relative risk (RR): 0.47; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.26-0.85; I(2) = 0\%], and may result in a lower need for rescue analgesia versus buprenorphine (low CoE; RR: 0.50; 95\% CI: 0.20-1.24), codeine (low CoE; RR: 0.75; 95\% CI: 0.16-3.41) and nalbuphine (low CoE; RR: 0.05; 95\% CI: 0.00-0.72). However, tramadol administration may result in an increased requirement for rescue analgesia versus methadone (low CoE; RR: 3.45; 95\% CI: 0.66-18.08; I(2) = 43\%) and COX inhibitors (low CoE; RR: 2.27; 95\% CI: 0.68-7.60; I(2) = 45\%). Compared with multimodal therapy, tramadol administration may make minimal to no difference in the requirement for rescue analgesia (low CoE; RR: 1.12; 95\% CI: 0.48-2.60; I(2) = 0\%). Adverse events were inconsistently reported and the CoE was very low. The overall CoE of the analgesic efficacy of tramadol for postoperative pain management in dogs was low or very low, and the main reasons for downgrading the evidence were risk of bias and imprecision.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Canine parvovirus 2 (CPV-2) is a pathogenic virus that infects dogs, causing a highly infectious disease. Monitoring CPV-2 spread is an important part of prevention; however, the prevalence and epidemiological characteristics of CPV-2 have not been systematically evaluated and analyzed in mainland China. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to assess prevalence and epidemiological characteristics of CPV-2 in domestic dogs in mainland China. METHODS: In this study, Chinese and English literature on CPV-2 epidemiology published between January 2006 and December 2019 was evaluated. Regarding meta-analysis, the random-effect model was employed by forest plot with 95\% of confidence interval. The number of CPV-2 infections was identified and the pooled prevalence of infection, as well as the epidemiological characteristics, was calculated using meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 39 studies (data from 137,844 dogs) met the evaluation criteria and were used in our study. The pooled prevalence of CPV-2 infection in mainland China was 36\%. CPV-2 infection were associated with age, breed, sampling season and immunization status, but not with gender, publication time and diagnostic methods. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that CPV-2 is prevalent among dogs in China. It is therefore necessary to carry out continuous surveillance and epidemiological studies of CPV-2. In addition, accordingly, effective measures should be taken to prevent the transmission and spread of CPV-2 among the Chinese dog population.},

A SR of experimental developmental animal PBDE-mediated neurotoxicity studies was performed in the present study. Outcomes assessed included measures related to learning, memory, and attention, which parallel the intelligence-related outcomes evaluated in the human studies SR. PubMed, Embase, and Toxline were searched for relevant experimental non-human mammalian studies. Evaluation of risk of bias (RoB) and overall body of evidence followed guidance developed by the National Toxicology Program. Animal studies using varying designs and outcomes were available for BDEs 47, 99, 153, 203, 206, and 209 and the technical mixture DE-71. Study reporting of methods and results was often incomplete leading to concerns regarding RoB. A meta-analysis of 6 Morris water maze studies showed evidence of a significant increase in last trial latency (effect size of 25.8 [CI, 20.3 to 31.2]) in PBDE-exposed animals with low heterogeneity. For most endpoints, there were unexplained inconsistencies across studies and no consistent evidence of a dose-response relationship. There is a "moderate" level of evidence that exposure to BDEs 47, 99, and 209 affects learning. For other PBDEs and other endpoints, the level of evidence was "low" or "very low". The meta-analysis led to stronger conclusions than that based upon a qualitative review of the evidence. The SR also identified RoB concerns that might be remedied by better study reporting.},

Confidence in the human and animal bodies of evidence was assessed and hazard conclusions reached by integrating evidence streams. The search yielded 6 relevant human studies and 19 animal studies. Meta-analysis of 5 human observational prospective cohort studies showed that increased maternal urinary concentrations of DEHP metabolites were associated with decreased AGD in boys (-4.07 [CI, -6.49 to -1.66] \% decrease per log(10) rise in DEHP metabolites). Meta-analysis and meta-regression of the 19 experimental animal studies found reduced AGD with DEHP treatment, with a dose-response gradient, and with heterogeneity explained by species and strain. There is a moderate level of evidence from human investigations and a high level of data from animal studies that in utero exposure to DEHP decreases AGD. Based upon the available human and animal evidence, and consideration of mechanistic data, DEHP is presumed to be a reproductive hazard to humans on the basis of effects on AGD.},

	abstract = {In the past decade, several conceptual papers have linked variation in animal personality to variation in cognition, and recent years have seen a flood of empirical studies testing this link. However, these results have not been synthesized in a quantitative way. Here, we systematically search the literature and conduct a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis of empirical papers that have tested the relationship between animal personality (exploration, boldness, activity, aggression and sociability) and cognition (initial learning/reversal speed, number of correct choices/errors after standard training). We find evidence for a small but significant relationship between variation in personality and variation in learning across species in the absolute scale; however, the direction of this relationship is highly variable and when both positive and negative effect sizes are considered, the average effect size does not differ significantly from zero. Importantly, this variation among studies is not explained by differences in personality or learning measure, or taxonomic grouping. Further, these results do not support current hypotheses suggesting that that fast-explorers are fast-learners or that slow-explorers perform better on tests of reversal learning. Rather, we find evidence that bold animals are faster learners, but only when boldness is measured in response to a predator (or simulated predator) and not when boldness is measured by exposure to a novel object (or novel food). Further, although only a small sub-sample of papers reported results separately for males and females, sex explained a significant amount of variation in effect size. These results, therefore, suggest that, while personality and learning are indeed related across a range of species, the direction of this relationship is highly variable. Thus further empirical work is needed to determine whether there are important moderators of this relationship.This article is part of the theme issue 'Causes and consequences of individual differences in cognitive abilities'.},

Currently, in preclinical research, new stimulation parameters are being investigated to achieve better and longer effects. This systematic review summarizes the status of SNM stimulation parameters and its effect on urinary tract and bowel dysfunction in preclinical research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The literature search was conducted using three databases: Ovid (Medline, Embase) and PubMed. Articles were included if they reported on stimulation parameters in animal studies for lower urinary tract or bowel dysfunction as a primary outcome. Methodological quality assessment was performed using the SYRCLE Risk of Bias (RoB) tool for animal studies. RESULTS: Twenty-two articles were eligible for this systematic review and various aspects of stimulation parameters were included: frequency, intensity, pulse width, stimulation signal, timing of stimulation, and unilateral vs. bilateral stimulation. In general, all experimental studies reported an acute effect of SNM on urinary tract or bowel dysfunction, whereas at the same time, various stimulation settings were used. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic review indicate that SNM has a positive therapeutic effect on lower urinary tract and bowel dysfunction. Using low-frequency-SNM, high-frequency-SNM, bilateral SNM, and higher pulse widths showed beneficial effects on storage and evacuation dysfunction in animal studies. An increased variability of stimulation parameters may serve as a basis for future improvement of the effect of SNM in patients suffering from urinary tract or bowel dysfunction.},

In a systematic review, 190 studies of tests for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle (published 1934-2009) were assessed by at least one of 18 reviewers using the QUADAS (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) checklist adapted for animal disease tests. VETQUADAS (VQ) included items measuring clarity in reporting (n = 3), internal validity (n = 9) and external validity (n = 2). A similar pattern for compliance was observed in studies of different diagnostic test types. Compliance significantly improved with year of publication for all items measuring clarity in reporting and external validity but only improved in four of the nine items measuring internal validity (p {\textless} 0.05). 107 references, of which 83 had performance data eligible for inclusion in a meta-analysis were reviewed by two reviewers. In these references, agreement between reviewers' responses was 71\% for compliance, 32\% for unsure and 29\% for non-compliance. Mean compliance with reporting items was 2, 5.2 for internal validity and 1.5 for external validity. The index test result was described in sufficient detail in 80.1\% of studies and was interpreted without knowledge of the reference standard test result in only 33.1\%. Loss to follow-up was adequately explained in only 31.1\% of studies. The prevalence of deficiencies observed may be due to inadequate reporting but may also reflect lack of attention to methodological issues that could bias the results of diagnostic test performance estimates. QUADAS was a useful tool for assessing and comparing the quality of studies measuring the performance of diagnostic tests but might be improved further by including explicit assessment of population sampling strategy.},

	abstract = {A systematic review was conducted to identify studies with data for statistical meta-analyses of sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of ante-mortem and post-mortem diagnostic tests for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle. Members of a working group (WG) developed and tested search criteria and developed a standardised two-stage review process, to identify primary studies with numerator and denominator data for test performance and an agreed range of covariate data. No limits were applied to year, language, region or type of test in initial searches of electronic databases. In stage 1, titles and available abstracts were reviewed. References that complied with stage 1 selection criteria were reviewed in entirety and agreed data were extracted from references that complied with stage 2 selection criteria. At stage 1, 9782 references were reviewed and 261 (2.6\%) passed through to stage 2 where 215 English language references were each randomly allocated to two of 18 WG reviewers and 46 references in other languages were allocated to native speakers. Agreement regarding eligibility between reviewers of the same reference at stage 2 was moderate (Kappa statistic = 0.51) and a resolution procedure was conducted. Only 119 references (published 1934-2009) were identified with eligible performance estimates for one or more of 14 different diagnostic test types; despite a comprehensive search strategy and the global impact of bTB. Searches of electronic databases for diagnostic test performance data were found to be nonspecific with regard to identifying references with diagnostic test Se or Sp data. Guidelines for the content of abstracts to research papers reporting diagnostic test performance are presented. The results of meta-analyses of the sensitivity and specificity of the tests, and of an evaluation of the methodological quality of the source references, are presented in accompanying papers (Nuñez-Garcia et al., 2017; Downs et al., 2017).},

	volume = {15},
	issn = {1932-6203},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0230038},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a rapid development in technologies that generate weak static magnetic fields (SMF) including high-voltage direct current (HVDC) lines, systems operating with batteries, such as electric cars, and devices using permanent magnets. However, few reviews on the effects of such fields on biological systems have been prepared and none of these evaluations have had a particular focus on weak SMF (≤ 1 mT). The aim of this review was to systematically analyze and evaluate possible effects of weak SMF (≤ 1 mT) on biological functioning and to provide an update on the current state of research. METHODS: This review was prepared in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. Methodological limitations in individual studies were assessed using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) Risk-of-Bias Rating Tool. RESULTS: Eleven studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. All included studies were experimental animal studies as no human studies were among the eligible articles. Eight of the eleven studies reported responses of rat, rabbits and quails to weak SMF exposure that were expressed as altered melatonin biosynthesis, reduced locomotor activity, altered vasomotion and blood pressure, transient changes in blood pressure-related biochemical parameters, or in the level of neurotransmitters and increases in enzyme activities. It remained largely unclear from the interpretation of the results whether the reported effects in the evaluated studies were beneficial or detrimental for health. CONCLUSION: The available evidence from the literature reviewed is not sufficient to draw a conclusion for biological and health-related effects of exposure to weak SMF. There was a lack of homogeneity regarding the exposed biological systems and the examined endpoints as well as a lack of scientific rigor in most reviewed studies which lowered credibility in the reported results. We therefore encourage further and more systematic research in this area. Any new studies should particularly address effects of exposure to SMF on biological functioning in humans to evaluate whether SMF pose a risk to human health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Amphenicols have been widely used in the pig industry in China, leading to varying degrees of drug resistance. METHODS: The systematic review was performed according to PRISMA (Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) recommendations on studies investigating the prevalence of amphenicol-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolated from pig in mainland China from 2000 to 2018, a random-effects model was selected, then followed by meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 103 articles were included in the study. The results of the meta-analysis revealed that the pooled summarized prevalence of resistance to chloramphenicol (CAP) was 72.31\% (95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) = 67.12\%-77.23\%) and to florfenicol (FF) was 58.64\% (95\% CI = 52.48\%-64.67\%). During the past 18 years, the resistance rate to CAP remained high initially but then declined rapidly after 2012, whereas the resistance rate to FF plateaued (54.13\%-59.60\%) from 2000-2018. In different parts of China, the rate of resistance to amphenicols among E. coli isolates was fairly consistent, with the exception of the north and northwest regions. CONCLUSIONS: In 2002, the veterinary use of CAP was prohibited and its resistance levels in E. coli isolated from pigs was initially maintained at a high level but then showed an obvious downward trend in recent years. Resistance to commonly used FF remained at a high but stable level.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is some concern that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may impair the healing of certain musculoskeletal tissues. However, the effect of NSAIDs on the specialized fibrocartilaginous transition at the tendon-to-bone interface remains largely unknown. Thus, the purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of NSAIDs on tendon-to-bone healing following acute injury or surgery. METHODS: A systematic review was performed according to the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), and SportDiscus databases were searched from the time of database inception to May 14, 2018 to identify all clinical and basic science studies investigating the effect of NSAIDs on tendon-to-bone healing. Methodological quality was assessed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) and SYstematic Review Center for Laboratory animal Research (SYRCLE) risk of bias assessment tools for clinical and basic science studies, respectively. A qualitative synthesis of the literature was performed with a subgroup meta-analysis of homogeneous basic science studies. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies, including three clinical and 10 basic science studies, were included. The overall methodological quality of the included clinical studies was poor, while assessment of the basic science studies revealed consistent areas at high or unclear risk of bias. Of the included clinical studies, a single study reported a higher rate of rotator cuff repair failure with selective (COX-2) NSAID use compared with non-selective NSAID use, while no clinical failures were noted with NSAID use following distal biceps tendon repair. Basic science studies had heterogeneous outcome reporting. A subgroup analysis of homogeneous animal studies revealed no significant effect of all NSAIDs (Standard Mean Difference [SMD] -1.05, 95\% Confidence Interval [CI] -2.39-0.30, p=0.13) or non-selective NSAIDs on load to failure (SMD -0.62, 95\% CI -1.26-0.02, p=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: The current literature does not provide sufficient evidence for or against the use of NSAIDs following acute injury or surgical repair of the tendon-bone interface.Level of Evidence: IV.},

Such approaches would be of interest not only for organic but also for conventional dairy producers. The objective of the current review was to quantify the effect of non-antimicrobial internal teat sealant (ITS)-based approaches at drying-off for treating and preventing IMI, when compared with no treatment or with an antimicrobial-based approach. The protocol for this review was published before initiating the review. A total of 18 trials from 16 articles could be used to investigate the effect of an ITS-based approach. With the available results, we conclude with a high level of confidence that non-antimicrobial ITS-based dry-off approaches are efficient for preventing new IMI during the dry period when compared with no treatment, and would reduce risk of new IMI by 52\%. Moreover, we are relatively confident that a bismuth subnitrate-based ITS performed better than an antimicrobial for preventing new IMI during the dry period (a risk reduction of 23\%). Similarly, we are relatively confident that an ITS-based approach would only slightly or not at all reduce the prevalence of IMI at calving compared with untreated quarters.},

METHODS: A systematic search was performed in the PubMed, Embase, ERIC, and PsycINFO databases.

Information on workplace-based assessment tools was extracted using data coding sheets. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using the medical education research study quality instrument (MERSQI). RESULTS: The search yielded 6,371 articles (180 were evaluated in full text). In total, 80 articles were included, identifying 67 assessment tools. Only a few studies explicitly mentioned assessment tools used as a resource for entrustment decisions. Validity evidence was frequently reported, and the MERSQI score was 10.0 on average. CONCLUSIONS: Many workplace-based assessment tools were identified that potentially support learners with feedback on their development and support supervisors with providing feedback. As expected, only few articles referred to entrustment decisions. Nevertheless, the existing tools or the principals could be used for entrustment decisions, supervision level, or autonomy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent deadly outbreaks of Marburg virus underscore the need for an effective vaccine. A summary of the latest research is needed for this WHO priority pathogen. This systematic review aimed to determine progress towards a vaccine for Marburg virus. METHODS: Article search criteria were developed to query PubMed for peer-reviewed articles from 1990 through 2019 on Marburg virus vaccine clinical trials in humans and pre-clinical studies in non-human primates (NHP). Abstracts were reviewed by two authors. Relevant articles were reviewed in full. Discrepancies were resolved by a third author. Data abstracted included year, author, title, vaccine construct, number of subjects, efficacy, and demographics. Assessment for risk of bias was performed using the Syrcle tool for animal studies, and the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool for human studies. RESULTS: 101 articles were identified; 27 were related to Marburg vaccines. After full text review, 21 articles were selected. 215 human subjects were in three phase 1 clinical trials, and 203 NHP in 18 studies. Vaccine constructs were DNA plasmids, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vectors, adenovirus vectors, virus-like particles (VLP), among others. Two human phase 1 studies of DNA vaccines had 4 adverse effects requiring vaccine discontinuation among 128 participants and 31-80\% immunogenicity. In NHP challenge studies, 100\% survival was seen in 6 VSV vectored vaccines, 2 DNA vaccines, 2 VLP vaccines, and in 1 adenoviral vectored vaccine. CONCLUSION: In human trials, two Marburg DNA vaccines provided either low immunogenicity or a failure to elicit durable immunity. A variety of NHP candidate Marburg vaccines demonstrated favorable survival and immunogenicity parameters, to include VSV, VLP, and adenoviral vectored vaccines. Elevated binding antibodies appeared to be consistently associated with protection across the NHP challenge studies. Further human trials are needed to advance vaccines to limit the spread of this highly lethal virus.},

	abstract = {The use of pressure via a bit in the horse's mouth is part of training methods throughout equine disciplines. Rein tension refers to the force exerted on the reins between the horse and human during ridden and in-hand training. Understanding the effects of these forces has the potential to inform both rider performance and equine welfare research. The methodological protocols of current rein tension research appear inconsistent, and to date, a review on rein tension has not been published. This study uses a systematic literature review to evaluate the tools and methods used to measure rein tension within current literature to establish whether their findings were reliable. The review also suggests improvements to study protocols, where appropriate, to enable the standardized measurement of rein tension. A search protocol was developed and inclusion criteria defined with the aid of independent subject specialists, including 2 published equestrian authors, an equine industry professional and a librarian. Inclusion criteria determined that only full peer-reviewed articles available via Google Scholar and published in the previous 15 years were included in the review. Articles also had to include the following key words: rein tension AND "horse/s" OR "rider/s" OR "equine/s" OR "equestrian." The literature search returned 154 initial results, and the inclusion criteria rejected 137 results. Seventeen primary research articles (after 2002) from peer-reviewed journals were subsequently reviewed. The articles reviewed found rein tension to be influenced by the horse, the rider, and the training equipment used. Rein tension studies have multivariable foci and methodological limitations and frequently report their methods and results inconsistently. Future rein tension research should aim to improve the consistency of reporting horse-related, rider-related, and performance-related factors that may affect rein tension, as well as reporting data handling and analysis approaches to increase comparability between studies.},

A total of 160 titles and abstracts were identified, and 29 publications met the inclusion criteria, 14 in vitro and 15 in vivo studies.

Preclinical studies described improvement of bone and periodontal healing with the association of adipose-derived cells and the carrier materials tested: Platelet Rich Plasma, Fibrin, Collagen and Synthetic polymer. There is evidence from the current in vitro and in vivo data indicating that adipose-derived cells may contribute to bone and periodontal regeneration. The small quantity of studies and the large variation on study designs, from animal models, cell sources and defect morphology, did not favor a meta-analysis. Additional studies need to be conducted to investigate the regeneration variability and the mechanisms of cell participation in the processes.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adequate nutrients early in life promote cognitive development and are critical for proper growth and functioning. The effect of individual nutrients consumed through food is often not the same as consuming the same nutrients in supplementary form due to 'food synergy', the biological and chemical interrelations that occur between nutrients. Animal-source foods, such as eggs, meat, fish, and dairy, are energy dense and contain multiple micronutrients and essential fatty acids with high bioavailability. The benefits of animal-source foods may include higher food synergy relative to fortified foods as well as decreasing dependence on external suppliers of fortified foods. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of animal-source foods compared to any other feeding interventions or no intervention in improving growth and developmental outcomes in children aged 6 to 59 months. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, 18 other databases, and three trials registers up to August 2018. We also contacted authors and known experts in the field for assistance in identifying ongoing or unpublished data, and searched the reference lists of included studies and reviews, and websites of relevant organizations, for other studies that may not have been captured by our electronic searches. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized controlled trials of any duration, where children between 5 months and 59 months (6 years) of age were provided with an animal-source food (e.g. consumption of milk, meat, or eggs), prepared with any cooking method, compared with any intervention or no intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility using prespecified criteria, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and graded the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: Study characteristicsWe included 6 studies that analyzed data from 3036 children aged 5 to 50 months. The studies were conducted in China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, Guatemala, Pakistan, the USA, and Zambia, and lasted between 5 and 12 months. Three studies were funded, in part, by government entities; one study was supported by a nonprofit organization. Two studies did not report a funding source.Three studies compared the effects of feeding an animal-source food with a fortified (iron or iron and zinc), or unfortified cereal; two used a control group with no intervention; one compared a meat-based diet to a dairy-based diet. The types of animal-source foods tested included yogurt, eggs, cheese, lyophilized (freeze-dried) beef product, ground and frozen pork, puréed and jarred beef with gravy or pork, and powdered whey protein.We judged four studies to be at unclear risk of bias overall; three studies because they were funded by an industry with a plausible interest in the outcome of the intervention; and one study because there was insufficient information to assess five of the seven bias 'Risk of bias' domains. We judged two of the six studies to be at high risk of bias overall; one study because there was significant baseline imbalance in length-for-age z scores (LAZ) between groups and evidence of selective reporting; the other study because there there was both a significant baseline imbalance in LAZ and weight-for-age z scores (WAZ) between groups, and a large-scale social media campaign that may have influenced care received at home in the control group.Key resultsAnimal-source foods versus cereal-based foods or no interventionFive studies (2972 children) measured change in linear growth with either height-for-age z scores (HAZ) or LAZ. Three studies (592 children) reported a significant increase in HAZ and LAZ in the intervention group compared to the control group. Two studies (2380 children) reported a decline in LAZ in both groups. In one study (1062 children) there was no difference between the groups in the rate of decline; in the other (1318 children) the decrease in LAZ was significantly smaller in the intervention group.Five studies (2972 children) measured weight gain using WAZ. Three studies (592 children) reported a significant increase in WAZ in the intervention group compared to the control group. In two studies (2380 children), WAZ decreased in both groups. In one of these studies (1318 children), the decrease in the intervention group was significantly smaller than in the control group. In the other study (1062 children), there was no difference between the groups.Three studies (1612 children) reported impacts on all-cause morbidity, but metrics were inconsistent between studies. One study with yogurt (402 children) reported a significant reduction in duration and incidence of diarrhea and upper respiratory infections in the intervention group. One study with eggs (148 children) reported a significant increase in the incidence of diarrhea in the intervention group, but this may have been due to cultural associations with eggs and gastrointestional problems. There were no other significant differences in fever, respiratory infections, or skin conditions between groups. The third study (1062 children) found no differences between intervention and control groups across morbidity measures.No studies reported data on anemia.Meat-based diet versus dairy-based dietOne study (64 children) measured change in LAZ and WAZ in infants fed either a meat-based diet or dairy-based diet. There was a significant increase in LAZ among infants consuming the meat-based diet and a significant decrease in LAZ among infants consuming a dairy-based diet. WAZ increased in both groups, with no significant difference between groups.The study did not assess all-cause morbidity or anemia.Quality of the evidenceWe rated the quality of the evidence as very low overall due to baseline imbalances between intervention and control groups, high heterogeneity in meta-analysis, and imprecision due to wide confidence intervals and inconsistent direction of effects. We have little confidence in the results; further research is likely to change the estimate of magnitude and direction of treatment effect. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Given the limited quality of the evidence, we are uncertain of the effects of the provision of animal-source food versus cereal products or no intervention on the growth or development of children. More adequately powered trials with deliberately selected animal-source foods are needed.},

	abstract = {Bovine trypanosomiasis is a disease of cattle. In sub-Saharan Africa, the disease mean prevalence estimates are unknown in most endemic countries. We therefore performed a meta-analysis with the aim of estimating national mean prevalence of bovine trypanosomiasis in endemic countries across sub-Saharan Africa. Relevant articles reporting bovine trypanosomiasis prevalence were retrieved through systematic literature search and scanning of articles reference-lists. Eligibility criteria included that articles reported sample size, prevalence, and diagnostic technique adopted. Overall, data from 180 eligible articles from 19 countries satisfied the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of prevalence data based on the random-effects model resulted in an overall mean prevalence of 15.10\% (95\% CI: 13.22-17.08). National prevalence estimates were generally high except those of Benin and Senegal where estimates ranked below 10.00\%. Significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 98.75\%. p = {\textless}0.0001) was noted between studies, and univariate meta-regression analysis identified choice of diagnostic method being major contributor to observed heterogeneity (R(2) = 36.37\%); while country of study (R(2) = 9.57\%) and sample size (R(2) = 3.47\%) had marginal effect on heterogeneity. In spite of past and ongoing control activities, bovine trypanosomiasis remains highly prevalent in most endemic sub-Saharan African countries. Nevertheless, dearth of epidemiological data in some countries and the use of less sensitive diagnostic tools limit reliable estimation of the disease prevalence. Therefore, there is the need to intensify efforts in aspects of surveillance and increased application of molecular diagnostic tool(s) across endemic locations as this would raise the chances of achieving a near-accurate estimate of the disease prevalence which is the first step to attempting eradication.},

	abstract = {The appraisal of the disease burden of African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) in some livestock at country level could invite a re-evaluation of trypanosomiasis-control strategy. This study thus estimates small ruminant and porcine trypanosomiasis prevalence in sub-Saharan African countries. It also describes Trypanosoma species prevalence in small ruminants and pigs and attempts identification of factors explaining between-study variations in prevalence. Articles reporting animal trypanosomiasis prevalence in sheep, goats, and pigs in countries within sub-Saharan Africa were retrieved from different databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and African Journal Online) and reference lists of relevant literatures. A total of 85 articles from 13 countries published between 1986 and 2018 were included in the analysis. Overall random-effects meta-analytic mean prevalence estimates were: 7.67\% (95\% CI: 5.22-10.49), 5.84\% (95\% CI: 3.81-8.23), and 19.46\% (95\% CI: 14.61-24.80) respectively, for sheep, goats, and pigs with substantial heterogeneity (I(2) = {\textgreater}95.00\%. p {\textless} 0.0001) noted between studies. Ovine, caprine, and porcine prevalence were highest in Tanzania (91.67\%. 95\% CI: 76.50-99.84), Equatorial Guinea (27\%. 95\% CI: 0-81.09), and Cameroon (47\%. 95\% CI: 29.67-66.06), respectively. Trypanosoma brucei s. l., T. vivax, and T. congolense were the most prevalent in the livestock. Trypanosoma brucei subspecies (T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense) occurred in all three livestock being mostly prevalent in pigs. Country of study was a significant predictor of trypanosomiasis prevalence in each livestock in addition to time and sample size for caprine hosts, diagnostic technique for both caprine and ovine hosts, and sample size for porcine hosts. The pattern of animal trypanosomiasis prevalence in the studied livestock reflects their susceptibility to trypanosomal infections and tsetse fly host feeding preferences. In conclusion, sheep, goats, and especially pigs are reservoirs of human infective trypanosomes in sub-Saharan Africa; consequently, their inclusion in sleeping sickness control programmes could enhance the goal of the disease elimination.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since Muybridge's 'horse in motion', researchers in the equine movement analysis field continue to improve objective analysis and performance monitoring while ensuring representative data capture. However, subjective evaluation remains the primary method of equine gait analysis in the applied setting, despite evidence highlighting the unreliability of this approach. OBJECTIVES: To map research trends, limitations and opportunities across the diverse equine gait analysis literature. STUDY DESIGN: Joanna Briggs Institute and Cochrane systematic scoping review. METHODS: Search terms were chosen based on the 'PICO' framework and included keywords such as: Equine, Gait, Kinematics and Analysis. Studies were excluded based on predetermined criteria by two independent researchers. Data were extracted from 510 articles from 1978 to 2018. RESULTS: Insights derived from movement analysis appear to be driven by tool availability. Observational research (42.9\%) was the most popular study design. Use of wearable technology as a primary research tool is established within the field, accounting for 13.5\% of studies. Analysis of limitations identified 17.8\% of studies citing challenges to the transferability of research results. Restricted sample size appears to be an underlying contributor to many of the limitations identified. In terms of research opportunities, advances in intervention studies were called for (10.4\% of studies) in the following three areas; clinical, rehabilitative exercise and performance/training. MAIN LIMITATIONS: This review was confined to research in the English language. CONCLUSIONS: Standardised research reporting may alleviate sample size issues by facilitating data pooling, database creation and meta-analyses. Large holistic data collections and application frameworks based on wearable technologies are not reflected in the current equine gait analysis literature and thus represent an interesting opportunity for this field. Progress and lessons learned from the human field of movement analysis can be useful in supporting this potential development.},

We aimed to assess whether the newly created models reproduce the full spectrum of human COVID-19. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, as well as BioRxiv and MedRxiv preprint servers for original research published in English from January 1 to May 20, 2020. We used the search terms (COVID-19) OR (SARS-CoV-2) AND (animal models), (hamsters), (nonhuman primates), (macaques), (rodent), (mice), (rats), (ferrets), (rabbits), (cats), and (dogs). Inclusion criteria were the establishment of animal models of COVID-19 as an endpoint. Other inclusion criteria were assessment of prophylaxis, therapies, or vaccines, using animal models of COVID-19. RESULT: Thirteen peer-reviewed studies and 14 preprints met the inclusion criteria. The animals used were nonhuman primates (n = 13), mice (n = 7), ferrets (n = 4), hamsters (n = 4), and cats (n = 1). All animals supported high viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract associated with mild clinical manifestations, lung pathology, and full recovery. Older animals displayed relatively more severe illness than the younger ones. No animal models developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction, culminating in death. All species elicited a specific IgG antibodies response to the spike proteins, which were protective against a second exposure. Transient systemic inflammation was observed occasionally in nonhuman primates, hamsters, and mice. Notably, none of the animals unveiled a cytokine storm or coagulopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the animal models of COVID-19 recapitulated mild pattern of human COVID-19 with full recovery phenotype. No severe illness associated with mortality was observed, suggesting a wide gap between COVID-19 in humans and animal models.},

The aim of this meta-analysis is to examine the efficacy of PT as a method for reducing physiological stress levels (blood pressure and heart rate) and subjective stress and anxiety scores (self-reported stress/anxiety). Further, we examined the effects of sample characteristics and modifications to the PT (different age groups and health status of participants across samples, whether a stressor was present, and individual versus group PT) as potential moderators of the relationship between PT and stress reactivity. Our searches incorporated articles published from May 2017 and earlier in PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and PubMed. This meta-analysis included 28 articles with 34 independent samples and contained a total of 1,310 participants. Using a random effects model, we determined that significant differences occurred in heart rate, self-reported anxiety, and self-reported stress after PT exposure compared with before PT. However, we did not detect significant differences in blood pressure after PT. Sample characteristics and modifications to the PT significantly moderated the effect of PT on stress responses. Our results suggest that PT can be an effective program for reducing stress reactivity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) initially presents with cognitive decline that affects the affected individual's daily activities. Cognitive decline reversal represents an important medical need, where Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE-5Is) might play a role. AIM: This systematic review was performed to verify the efficacy of PDE-5Is in preventing cognitive impairment and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Preclinical animal studies assessing the efficacy of PDE-5Is in preventing cognitive impairment and pathological changes by measuring Aβ-42 β42 and p-Tau were included in the analysis. CAMARADES Checklist was used to assess study quality. Further, various signaling pathways in different studies were examined. RESULTS AND OUTCOMES: Data of behavioral tests were extracted and a meta-analysis was conducted. Fifteen animal trials met the inclusion criteria, and all reported the prevention of cognitive deficits by PDE-5Is in Alzheimer's disease. A significant effect of PDE-5Is in increasing the time spent in the target quadrant was reported in four of seven studies using the water maze. Four studies showed significant improvement in contextual fear memory freezing time, and three studies showed improvement in the 14 unit maze number of errors. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive decline in preclinical AD finds tauopathy has a more impact than Aβ-42. This systematic review showed that PDE-5 inhibitors might help prevent cognitive impairment in AD, and while its mechanism of action is non-related to Aβ-42, it might include decrease p-Tau, increase CREB and BDNF or suppressing apoptosis and inflammation. However, the efficacy of PDE-5 inhibitors in preventing cognitive impairment remains unclear due to various limitations, such as the small number of included studies, the high risk of bias, the lack of an integrated study design, and low reporting quality.},

	abstract = {Scrub typhus, caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, is an important and neglected vector-borne zoonotic disease with an expanding known distribution. The ecology of the disease is complex and poorly understood, impairing discussion of public health interventions. To highlight what we know and the themes of our ignorance, we conducted a systematic review of all studies investigating the pathogen in vectors and non-human hosts. A total of 276 articles in 7 languages were included, with 793 study sites across 30 countries. There was no time restriction for article inclusion, with the oldest published in 1924. Seventy-six potential vector species and 234 vertebrate host species were tested, accounting for over one million trombiculid mites ('chiggers') and 83,000 vertebrates. The proportion of O. tsutsugamushi positivity was recorded for different categories of laboratory test and host species. Vector and host collection sites were geocoded and mapped. Ecological data associated with these sites were summarised. A further 145 articles encompassing general themes of scrub typhus ecology were reviewed. These topics range from the life-cycle to transmission, habitats, seasonality and human risks. Important gaps in our understanding are highlighted together with possible tools to begin to unravel these. Many of the data reported are highly variable and inconsistent and minimum data reporting standards are proposed. With more recent reports of human Orientia sp. infection in the Middle East and South America and enormous advances in research technology over recent decades, this comprehensive review provides a detailed summary of work investigating this pathogen in vectors and non-human hosts and updates current understanding of the complex ecology of scrub typhus. A better understanding of scrub typhus ecology has important relevance to ongoing research into improving diagnostics, developing vaccines and identifying useful public health interventions to reduce the burden of the disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Resting endoscopy has commonly been used as a method to predict laryngeal function at exercise. OBJECTIVES: To perform a meta-analysis to determine the sensitivity and specificity of resting laryngeal endoscopy to predict clinical recurrent laryngeal neuropathy at exercise. STUDY DESIGN: Meta-analysis. METHODS: Manuscripts were included if data were available for both resting and exercising airway function on all or a subset of horses. Normal resting endoscopy was defined as laryngeal grades 1 or 2 on a 4-/7-point scale or 1, 2 or 3 on a 5-point scale and normal dynamic endoscopy as a dynamic laryngeal grade A. RESULTS: Twelve studies including 1827 horses were evaluated. A small proportion of horses with grade 1 or grade 2 laryngeal function at rest, 3.5 and 11.9\%, respectively, were identified as having abnormal laryngeal function at exercise. Within the horses with grade 3 laryngeal function at rest, 16\% were classified as grade A, 26.4\% as grade B and 57.6\% as grade C at exercise. Worsening subgrades within resting grade 3 demonstrated an increasing proportion of complete or partial paralysis at exercise. The sensitivity and specificity of resting endoscopy was 74.4 and 95.1\%, respectively, and the positive and negative predictive values were 85.6 and 90.5\% respectively. MAIN LIMITATIONS: Use of two separate grading systems for evaluating resting laryngeal function. Other forms of dynamic airway collapse were not evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Resting endoscopy is sensitive and highly specific for predicting laryngeal function at exercise. Dynamic endoscopy is important to assess multiple causes of airway collapse.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: High feed osmolality (or osmolarity) is often suggested to be linked with adverse gastrointestinal events in preterm infants. AIM: To systematically review the literature on milk feed osmolality and adverse gastrointestinal events in newborn and low birthweight infants and animals. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, CAB Abstracts, Current Contents, BIOSIS Previews and SciSearch were searched from inception to May 2018 to identify potentially relevant studies. INCLUSION CRITERIA: randomised controlled or observational studies of newborn and low birthweight infants or animals investigating the effects of milk-based feeds with different osmolalities. Only full-text, English-language papers were included. RESULTS: Ten human and six animal studies met the inclusion criteria. Of human studies, seven reported no differences in adverse events with varying feed osmolalities; one reported delayed gastric emptying with feed osmolarity of 539 mOsm/L compared with lower levels; one reported higher necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) incidence with feed osmolarity of 650 mOsm/L compared with 359 mOsm/L; one found higher NEC incidence with the lowest feed osmolality (326 mOsm/kg compared with 385 mOsm/kg). Of animal studies, two reported delayed gastric emptying with feed osmolarity {\textgreater}624 mOsm/L, one reported decreased survival due to dehydration with dietary osmolarities ≥765 mOsmol/L and none reported increased NEC incidence with differing feed osmolalities. No clear mechanisms were found, and diet composition differences limited the interpretations regarding the independent impact of osmolality. CONCLUSIONS: There is no consistent evidence that differences in feed osmolality in the range 300-500 mOsm/kg are associated with adverse gastrointestinal symptoms in neonates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many lung diseases. Preclinical studies suggest that mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) conditioned media (CdM) can attenuate inflammation. Our aim was threefold: (1) summarize the existing animal literature evaluating CdM as a therapeutic agent for pediatric/adult lung disease, (2) quantify the effects of CdM on inflammation, and (3) compare inflammatory effects of CdM to MSCs. METHODS: Adhering to the Systematic Review Protocol for Animal Intervention Studies, a systematic search of English articles was performed in five databases. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed to generate random effect size using standardized mean difference (SMD). RESULTS: A total of 10 studies met inclusion. Lung diseases included bronchopulmonary dysplasia, asthma, pulmonary hypertension, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. CdM decreased inflammatory cells (1.02 SMD, 95\% CI 0.86, 1.18) and cytokines (0.71 SMD, 95\% CI 0.59, 0.84). The strongest effect for inflammatory cells was in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (3.74 SMD, 95\% CI 3.13, 4.36) while pulmonary hypertension had the greatest reduction in inflammatory cytokine expression (1.44 SMD, 95\% CI 1.18, 1.71). Overall, CdM and MSCs had similar anti-inflammatory effects. CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis of animal models recapitulating lung disease, CdM improved inflammation and had an effect size comparable to MSCs. While these findings are encouraging, the risk of bias and heterogeneity limited the strength of our findings.},

	abstract = {Background: Physical exercise is suspected to reduce cancer risk and mortality. So far, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Although limited, murine models represent a promising attempt in order to gain knowledge in this field. Objective: A systematic review and meta-analysis examining various treatment protocols was conducted in order to determine the impact of exercise on tumor growth in rodents. Methods: PubMed, Google scholar and System for information on Gray literature in Europe were screened from inception to October 2017. Risk of bias within individual studies was assessed using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation risk of bias rating tool for human and animal trials. The effect of exercise on tumor growth over and above non-exercise control was pooled using random-effects model. Subgroup analyses were conducted to identify potential moderators. Results: The quality of the included 17 articles ranged between "probably low" and "high risk of bias." A significant reduction in tumor growth in exercising animals compared to controls was detected (Hedges' g = -0.40; 95\% CI -0.66 to -0.14, p {\textless} 0.01) with between-study heterogeneity (τ(2) = 0.217, I (2) = 70.28\%, p {\textless} 0.001). The heterogeneity was partially explained by three moderators representing the in-between group differences of "maximum daily exercise" R (2) = 33\% (p {\textless} 0.01), "type of cancer administration" R (2) = 28\% (p {\textless} 0.05), and "training initiation" R (2) = 27\% (p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that physical exercise leads to reduction of tumor size in rodents. Since "maximum daily exercise" was found to have at least modest impact on tumor growth, more clinical trials investigating dose-response relationships are needed.},

We extracted the molecular prevalence of C. burnetii in milk from cows, goats, sheep, and camels in Iran. The total prevalence of C. burnetii in cow milk was 15.09\% (95\% CI 11.08-19.10) by PCR methods. The highest and lowest prevalence of Q fever agent were seen in the East Azerbaijan (25.55\%) and Khorasan-Razavi (4.22\%) provinces, respectively. The molecular prevalence of C. burnetii in goat milk was 7.80\% (95\% CI 3.54-12.07\%). The provinces of Qom (0\%) and Lorestan (44.71\%) had the lowest and the highest frequency of C. burnetii infection in goat's milk, respectively. Total prevalence of C. burnetii in sheep milk was 3.79\% (95\% CI 0.72-6.87\%). The highest frequency of C. burnetii in sheep milk was detected in the Khorasan-Razavi province (34.78\%). The frequency of C. burnetii in camel milk was 1.43\%. High infection of C. burnetii in milk is an important health problem in Iran, amplified by the traditional preparations of dairy products.},

	abstract = {Zoonotic pathogens constitute the major source (60.3\%) of emerging infectious diseases. Previous studies have investigated the prevalence of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) among wild animal species, but comprehensive data are needed to assess the role that these animals have in the transmission of STEC infections to the human population via faecal contamination of the environment, agri-food or water chain. Due to the nature of these microorganisms in which this human-animal-environment interface plays a relevant role on the disease's dynamics, a "One Health" approach is needed to prevent and control the worldwide spread. The aim of this study was to review the published research on the prevalence of STEC in wildlife. The search was performed using several online databases consisting of three blocks of specific search terms covering pathogen, type of study and population. Two reviewers applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to screening and eligibility phases. Two hundred and twenty-five abstracts were screened for relevance, and 72 were included for data analysis. Most studies (77.8\%) investigated the prevalence of STEC in ruminants and urban birds. Their role in transmitting the pathogen to humans, other animals and the agri-food chain is potentiated by the peculiar biological characteristics in ruminants and improved adaptation of urban birds to urban environments. The popularity of convenience and voluntary response sampling may be due to the lack of human-made boundaries on the wild animal species' habitat and having some samples from hunted-harvested animals. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review on STEC prevalence in wild animal species from studies conducted across the globe. We recommend that future research includes and compares samples from varying origins (i.e., human, animal, environment and food) and applies a "One Health" approach to the emerging challenges that STEC poses to public health.},

	abstract = {Arboviruses represent a significant burden to public health and local economies due to their ability to cause unpredictable and widespread epidemics. To maximize early detection of arbovirus emergence in non-endemic areas, surveillance efforts should target areas where circulation is most likely. However, identifying such hotspots of potential emergence is a major challenge. The ecological conditions leading to arbovirus outbreaks are shaped by complex interactions between the virus, its vertebrate hosts, arthropod vector, and abiotic environment that are often poorly understood. Here, we systematically review the ecological risk factors associated with the circulation of six arboviruses that are of considerable concern to northwestern Europe. These include three mosquito-borne viruses (Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Rift Valley fever virus) and three tick-borne viruses (Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and louping-ill virus). We consider both intrinsic (e.g. vector and reservoir host competence) and extrinsic (e.g. temperature, precipitation, host densities, land use) risk factors, identify current knowledge gaps, and discuss future directions. Our systematic review provides baseline information for the identification of regions and habitats that have suitable ecological conditions for endemic circulation, and therefore may be used to target early warning surveillance programs aimed at detecting multi-virus and/or arbovirus emergence.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: We have performed a systematic search to summarize the role of statins for preventing and treating severe preeclampsia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine whether pravastatin is a useful and safe alternative for treating preeclampsia during pregnancy. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic MEDLINE (PubMed) search was performed (1979 to June 2017), which was restricted to articles published in English, using the relevant key words of "statins," "pregnancy," "preeclampsia," "obstetrical antiphospholipid syndrome," and "teratogenicity." RESULTS: The initial search provided 296 articles. Finally, 146 articles were related to the use of statins during pregnancy, regarding their effect on the fetus and the treatment of preeclampsia. Ten studies were related to in vitro studies, 25 in animals, and 24 in humans (13 case report series and 11 cohort studies). We found 84 studies on reviews of such guidelines on cardiovascular disease (35 studies), use of statins in the antiphospholipid syndrome (25 studies), statin's specific use during pregnancy (13 studies), or preeclampsia treatment (11 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Although the studies are of poor quality, the rate of major congenital abnormalities in the newborn exposed to statins during pregnancy is no higher than the expected when compared with overall risk population. The review shows a potential beneficial role of statins in preventing and treating severe preeclampsia that needs to be evaluated through well-designed clinical trials. RELEVANCE: This update could influence positively the clinical practice, giving an alternative therapy for clinicians who treat preeclampsia, particularly in severe cases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: West Nile Virus (WNV), a member of the genus Flavivirus, is one of the most widely distributed arboviruses in the world. Despite some evidence for circulation of WNV in countries summarized by the World Health Organization as the Eastern Mediterrian Regional Office (EMRO), comprehensive knowledge about its epidemiology remains largely unknown. This study aims to provide a concise review of the published literature on WNV infections in the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office of WHO (EMRO). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A systematic review of WNV prevalence studies on humans, animals and vectors in the EMRO region was performed by searching: Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, PubMed, Embase and Google Scholar. Finally, 77 citations were included, comprising 35 seroprevalence studies on general population (24460 individuals), 15 prevalence studies among patients (3439 individuals), 22 seroprevalence studies among animals (10309 animals), and 9 studies on vectors (184242 vector species). Of the 22 countries in this region, five had no data on WNV infection among different populations. These countries include Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Syria and Somalia. On the other hand, among countries with available data, WNV-specific antibodies were detected in the general population of all investigated countries including Djibouti (0.3-60\%), Egypt (1-61\%), Iran (0-30\%), Iraq (11.6-15.1\%), Jordan (8\%), Lebanon (0.5-1\%), Libya (2.3\%), Morocco (0-18.8\%), Pakistan (0.6-65.0\%), Sudan (2.2-47\%), and Tunisia (4.3-31.1\%). WNV RNA were also detected in patient populations of Iran (1.2\%), Pakistan (33.3\%), and Tunisia (5.3\% -15.9\%). WNV-specific antibodies were also detected in a wide range of animal species. The highest seropositivity rate was observed among equids (100\% in Morocco) and dogs (96\% in Morocco). The highest seroprevalence among birds was seen in Tunisia (23\%). In addition, WNV infection was detected in mosquitoes (Culex, and Aedes) and ticks (Argas reflexus hermanni). The primary vector of WNV (Culex pipiens s.l.) was detected in Djibouti, Egypt, Iran and Tunisia, and in mosquitoes of all these countries, WNV was demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: This first systematic regional assessment of WNV prevalence provides evidence to support the circulation of WNV in the EMRO region as nearly all studies showed evidence of WNV infection in human as well as animal/vector populations. These findings highlight the need for continued prevention and control strategies and the collection of epidemiologic data for WNV epidemic status, especially in countries that lack reliable surveillance systems.},

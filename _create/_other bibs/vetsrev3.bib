	abstract = {Knowledge about acute pancreatitis has increased recently in both the medical and veterinary fields. Despite this expansion of knowledge, there are very few studies on treatment interventions in naturally occurring disease in dogs. As a result, treatment recommendations are largely extrapolated from experimental rodent models or general critical care principles. General treatment principles involve replacing fluid losses, maintaining hydrostatic pressure, controlling nausea and providing pain relief. Specific interventions recently advocated in human medicine include the use of neurokinin-1 antagonists for analgesia and early interventional feeding. The premise for early feeding is to improve the health of the intestinal tract, as unhealthy enterocytes are thought to perpetuate systemic inflammation. The evidence for early interventional feeding is not supported by robust clinical trials to date, but in humans there is evidence that it reduces hospitalisation time and in dogs it is well tolerated. This article summarises the major areas of management of acute pancreatitis in dogs and examines the level of evidence for each recommendation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to systematically review randomized, controlled trials of fluid resuscitation in animal models of uncontrolled hemorrhage and to explore potential sources of heterogeneity. METHODS: We conducted an electronic bibliographic search of published research, reviewed reference lists of included trials, and contacted authors about unpublished studies. We included all unconfounded, randomized, controlled trials of fluid resuscitation (timing, volume, or resuscitation targets) in animal models of uncontrolled hemorrhage. The outcome measure was mortality at the end of the scheduled follow-up period of the trial. Two reviewers independently applied the selection criteria to the trial reports. A third reviewer resolved disagreements. RESULTS: Forty-four trials compared fluid versus no fluid resuscitation. There was marked heterogeneity in the effect of fluid resuscitation on the risk of death, much of which was explained by the hemorrhage model used. In aortic injury models, the adjusted relative risk of death with fluid resuscitation was 0.48 (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.33-0.71). In organ incision models, the adjusted relative risk of death was 0.76 (95\% CI, 0.49-1.18). In tail resection models, the adjusted relative risk of death was 0.69 (95\% CI, 0.38-1.25) if 50\% or more was removed and 1.86 (95\% CI, 1.13-3.07) if less than 50\% was removed. In other vascular injury models, the adjusted relative risk of death with fluid resuscitation was 1.70 (95\% CI, 1.01-2.85), respectively. Nine trials compared hypotensive versus normotensive resuscitation. The relative risk of death with hypotensive resuscitation was 0.37 (95\% CI, 0.27-0.50). CONCLUSION: Fluid resuscitation appears to reduce the risk of death in animal models of severe hemorrhage but increases the risk of death in those with less severe hemorrhage. Excessive fluid resuscitation could therefore be harmful in some situations. Hypotensive resuscitation reduced the risk of death in all the trials investigating it. An evaluation of the potential impact of hypotensive resuscitation in humans could now be warranted.},

	abstract = {Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is considered one of the most important infectious diseases of livestock because of the devastating economic consequences that it inflicts in affected regions. The value of critical parameters, such as the duration of the latency or the duration of the infectious periods, which affect the transmission rate of the FMD virus (FMDV), are believed to be influenced by characteristics of the host and the virus. Disease control and surveillance strategies, as well as FMD simulation models, will benefit from improved parameter estimation. The objective of this study was to quantify the distributions of variables associated with the duration of the latency, subclinical, incubation, and infectiousness periods of FMDV transmission. A double independent, systematic review of 19 retrieved publications reporting results from experimental trials, using 295 animals in four reference laboratories, was performed to extract individual values related to FMDV transmission. Probability density functions were fitted to data and a set of regression models were used to identify factors associated with the assessed parameters. Latent, subclinical, incubation, and infectious periods ranged from 3.1 to 4.8, 2 to 2.3, 5.5 to 6.6, and 3.3 to 5.7 days, respectively. Durations were significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) associated independently with route of exposure, type of donor, animal species, strains, characteristics of sampling, and clinical signs. These results will contribute to the improvement of disease control and surveillance strategies and stochastic models used to simulate FMD spread and, ultimately, development of cost-effective plans to prevent and control the potential spread of the disease in FMD-free regions of the world.},

	abstract = {The role of the horse in Coxiella burnetii infection has not been defined. Accordingly, a twofold approach was taken to further our knowledge on this topic: (1) conduct a systematic review of the literature to establish available evidence of C. burnetii infection in the horse; (2) undertake a biomolecular investigation of 122 cases of equine abortion, stillbirth and neonatal foal death, for the presence of C. burnetii using a PCR test targeting the IS1111 gene of C. burnetii. A review of the literature turned up seven studies that identified C. burnetii DNA in equine specimens, especially aborted fetuses, while an additional 34 studies sought to determine seroprevalence of the infection in the horse. A meta-analytical approach was taken to calculate a pooled mean seroprevalence in equines based on published studies. A seroprevalence of 15.8\% (95\% confidence interval: 9.6-23.0\%) was obtained. This figure is comparable to those previously reported in other species, especially ruminants. None of the 122 cases of equine abortion, stillbirth or neonatal foal death were positive for C. burnetii DNA. C. burnetii has rarely been looked for in equine specimens in previous studies. Cases of equine abortion should be comprehensively investigated to assess the risk of abortion in a pregnant mare infected with C. burnetii. Consideration should also be given to the possible role of the horse as a source of the organism for other animal species including humans.},

Specific veterinary telemedicine applications have been in use since the early 1980s, but little research has been undertaken in this field. The Pubmed and CAB International databases were searched for the following Boolean logic-linked keywords; veterinary and telemedicine, veterinary and telecare, animal and telemedicine, animal and telecare and veterinary and e-mail and an additional search was made of the worldwide web, using Google Scholar. This returned 25 papers which were reviewed. Of these only 2 report research. Sixteen papers had no references and 1 author was associated with 13 papers. Several themes emerge in the papers reviewed. These include remarks about the use of telemedicine, the benefits that can and are derived from the use of telemedicine, areas of practice in which telemedicine is being used, ethical and legal issues around the practice of telemedicine, image standards required for telemedicine, the equipment that is required for the practice of telemedicine, advice on ways in which digital images can be obtained and educational aspects of telemedicine. These are discussed. Veterinary practice has lagged behind its human counterpart in producing research on the validity and efficacy of telemedicine.

	volume = {99},
	issn = {1525-3198},
	doi = {10.3168/jds.2015-10427},
	abstract = {The effects of casein infusion have been investigated extensively in ruminant species. Its effect on responses in dry matter intake (DMI) has been reviewed and indicated no significant effect. The literature reviewed in the current meta-analysis is more extensive and limited to dairy cows fed ad libitum. A total of 51 studies were included in the meta-analysis and data were fitted to a multilevel model adjusting for the correlated nature of some studies. The effect size was the mean difference calculated by subtracting the means for the control from the casein-infused group. Overall, casein infusion [average of 333g of dry matter (DM)/d; range: 91 to 1,092g of DM/d] tended to increase responses in DMI by 0.18kg/d (n=48 studies; 3 outliers). However, an interaction was observed between the casein infusion rate (IR) and the initial metabolizable protein (MP) balance [i.e., supply minus requirements (NRC, 2001)]. When control cows were in negative MP balance (n=27 studies), responses in DMI averaged 0.28kg/d at mean MP balance (-264g/d) and casein IR (336g/d), and a 100g/d increment in the casein IR from its mean increased further responses by 0.14kg/d (MP balance being constant), compared with cows not infused with casein. In contrast, when control cows were in positive MP balance (n=22 studies; 2 outliers), responses in DMI averaged -0.20kg/d at mean casein IR (339g/d), and a 100g/d increment in the casein IR from its mean further decreased responses by 0.33kg/d, compared with cows not infused with casein. Responses in milk true protein yield at mean casein IR were greater (109 vs. 65g/d) for cows in negative vs. positive MP balance, respectively, and the influence of the casein IR on responses was significant only for cows in negative MP balance. A 100g/d increment in the casein IR from its mean increased further responses in milk true protein yield by 25g/d, compared with cows not infused with casein. Responses in blood urea concentration increased in casein studies (+0.59mM) and the influence of the casein IR was greatest for cows in positive MP balance (0.26 vs. 0.11mM per 100g/d increment). Responses in DMI were also correlated negatively with responses in blood urea concentration only for cows in positive MP balance. Together, these results suggest an association between satiety and deamination and oxidation of AA supplied in excess of requirements for cows in positive MP balance. Therefore, casein stimulated appetite in cows fed MP-deficient diets possibly via the supply of orexigenic AA or through a pull effect in response to an increased metabolic demand. Conversely, casein induced satiety in cows fed diets supplying MP in excess of requirements. Not precluding other factors involved in satiety (e.g., insulin, gut peptides), casein could have increased the supply of AA (e.g., Ser, Thr, Tyr), which might depress appetite at the brain level or increase the deamination and the oxidation of AA in oversupply in agreement with the hepatic oxidation theory.},

Although only half of the experiments of the initial meta-analysis reported concentrations of plasma AA and could be used in the current meta-analysis, lactational responses to CM feeding were similar to those reported previously. In the current meta-analysis, CM feeding increased plasma concentrations of total AA, total essential AA (EAA) and all individual EAA, but decreased concentrations of blood and milk urea-N.

The study included 49 comparisons of isonitrogenous (+/- 1.0\% dietary CP content) dietary treatments published since 1975 (27 experiments). The CM intake ranged from 1.0 to 4.0 kg/d (standard deviation = 0.65). Regressions were forced through the origin, weighted by sample size, and controlled for changes in dry matter intake and in dietary concentrations of CP and ether extract. Milk yield and milk protein yield responded positively to the substitution of a protein source by CM. The response in milk protein yield was affected by the type of protein source that was substituted; the positive response was half less when CM was substituted for soybean meal compared with substitution of CM for other protein sources. The latter effect was in part related to a positive response on milk protein percentage when CM replaced protein sources other than soybean meal. The response in efficiency of N utilization (milk N yield/N intake) was positive to the substitution of a protein source by CM. Negative changes in supply of metabolizable protein (MP) estimated from the 2001 National Research Council model were associated with positive responses in milk protein yield with CM substitution, a finding contrary to the expected positive relationship between supply of MP and milk protein yield. In conclusion, a protein supplement can be substituted by CM with positive effects on milk and milk protein production. These data also indicate an underestimation of MP supply associated with CM inclusion in dairy rations using the National Research Council model.},

	abstract = {Decrease of N intake (NI) with the aim of increasing efficiency of N utilization and decreasing the negative environmental effects of animal production requires assessment of the forms in which N is absorbed. A meta-analysis was conducted on 68 publications (90 experiments and 215 treatments) to study the effect of NI on net portal appearance (NPA) of nitrogenous nutrients [amino acids (AA), ammonia, and urea] in ruminants. In addition, the effect of several dietary energy and protein factors on this relationship was investigated. These factors were: dry matter intake; proportion of concentrate; diet concentrations and intakes of nonfiber carbohydrates and neutral detergent fiber (NDF); diet concentrations of total digestible nutrients (TDN) and crude protein; rumen-degradable protein and rumen-undegradable protein, as percent dry matter or percent crude protein. The effect of species and physiological stage was also investigated. Within-experiment analyses revealed that the NPA of AA-N and ammonia-N increased linearly, whereas the NPA of urea-N decreased (or recycling of urea-N increased) linearly with NI. Besides NI, many significant covariates could be introduced in each NPA model. However, only TDN and neutral detergent fiber intake (NDFi) were common significant covariates of NI in each NPA model. In this database, ruminants converted 60\% of incremental NI into NPA of AA-N with no species effect on that slope. However, at similar NI, TDN, and NDFi, sheep absorbed more AA-N than did cattle and dairy cows. On the other hand, species tended to affect the slope of the relationship between NPA of ammonia-N and NI, which varied from 0.19 for the sheep to 0.38 for dairy cows. On average, the equivalent of 11\% of incremental NI was recycled as urea-N to the gut through the portal-drained viscera, which excludes salivary contribution, and no species difference was detected. Overall, at similar TDN and NDFi, sheep and cattle increased their NPA of AA-N relative to NI increment by a similar magnitude. The higher absorption of AA-N observed in sheep compared with cattle, at similar NI, TDN, and NDFi, might result from lower losses of AA through portal-drained viscera metabolism.},

SOURCES OF DATA: A search of PubMed, Medline, CINAHL, DH data and Embase databases was performed using the keywords 'ultrasound' and 'fracture healing'. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: The evidence in vitro and animal studies suggests that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) produces significant osteoinductive effects, accelerating the healing process and improving the bone-bending strength. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: The evidence in human trials is controversial in fresh, stress fractures and in limb lengthening. LIPUS is effective in delayed unions, in smokers and in diabetic population. GROWING POINTS: LIPUS is an alternative, less invasive form of treatment for complicated fractures, in patients with poor bone healing and may play a role in the management of large-scale bone defects producing substantial cost savings and decreasing associated disability. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: There is heterogeneity among in vitro, animal studies and their application to human studies. Further randomized controlled trials of high methodological quality are needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Canine distemper virus (CDV) is the etiological agent of one of the most infectious diseases of domestic dogs, also known as a highly prevalent viral infectious disease of carnivores and posing a conservation threat to endangered species around the world. To get a better panorama of CDV infection in different Orders, a retrospective and documental systematic review of the role of CDV in different non-dog hosts was conducted. The bibliographical data were collected from MedLine/PubMed and Scopus databases. Data related to Order, Family, Genus and Species of the infected animals, the presence or absence of clinical signs, mortality, serological, molecular or antigenic confirmation of CDV infection, geographic location, were collected and summarized. RESULTS: Two hundred seventeen scientific articles were considered eligible which includes reports of serological evaluation, and antigenic or genomic confirmation of CDV infection in non-dog hosts. CDV infects naturally and experimentally different members of the Orders Carnivora (in 12 Families), Rodentia (four Families), Primates (two Families), Artiodactyla (three Families) and Proboscidea (one Family). The Order Carnivora (excluding domestic dogs) accounts for the vast majority (87.5\%) of the records. Clinical disease associated with CDV infection was reported in 51.8\% of the records and serological evidence of CDV infection in apparently healthy animals was found in 49.5\% of the records. High mortality rate was showed in some of the recorded infections in Orders different to Carnivora. In non-dog hosts, CDV has been reported all continents with the exception of Australasia and in 43 different countries. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic review demonstrate that CDV is able to infect a very wide range of host species from many different Orders and emphasizes the potential threat of infection for endangered wild species as well as raising concerns about potential zoonotic threats following the cessation of large-scale measles vaccination campaigns in the human population.},

	abstract = {Mastitis is the first cause of economic loss in the dairy sector. The efficacy of the existing vaccines against mastitis is questioned by several authors. It is the aim of this paper to shed some light on this question. A meta-analysis was conducted on 15 field research trials, which included a total of 7941 cows (4317 vaccinated and 3624 used as control). A random-effects model was adjusted and found significant (P{\textless}0,01). The unit used was the rate ratio between vaccinated cows and controls and was found to have a value of 0,604 with a 95\% confidence interval of [0,373; 0,979], after correction for publication bias. It was concluded that vaccination to control mastitis has a slight advantage, but the economics of its use depends on the weighting between its cost and its benefit, and therefore traditional preventive measures still have an important role to play; Mastitis vaccines can be used as a complement of all the other preventive measures but not as a substitute of these.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: No systematic review has previously been carried out on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of veterinary homeopathy in which the control group was an intervention other than placebo (OTP). For eligible peer-reviewed RCTs, the objectives of this study were to assess the risk of bias (RoB) and to quantify the effect size of homeopathic intervention compared with an active comparator or with no treatment. METHODS: Our systematic review approach complied fully with the PRISMA 2009 Checklist. Cochrane methods were applied to assess RoB and to derive effect size using standard meta-analysis methods. Based on a thorough and systematic literature search, the following key attributes of the published research were distinguished: individualised homeopathy (n = 1 RCT)/non-individualised homeopathy (n = 19); treatment (n = 14)/prophylaxis (n = 6); active controls (n = 18)/untreated controls (n = 2). The trials were highly diverse, representing 12 different medical conditions in 6 different species. RESULTS: No trial had sufficiently low RoB to be judged as reliable evidence: 16 of the 20 RCTs had high RoB; the remaining four had uncertain RoB in several domains of assessment. For three trials with uncertain RoB and without overt vested interest, it was inconclusive whether homeopathy combined with conventional intervention was more or was less effective than conventional intervention alone for modulation of immune response in calves, or in the prophylaxis of cattle tick or of diarrhoea in piglets. CONCLUSION: Due to the poor reliability of their data, OTP-controlled trials do not currently provide useful insight into the effectiveness of homeopathy in animals.},

For all medical conditions and species collectively, we tested the hypothesis that the outcome of homeopathic intervention (treatment and/or prophylaxis, individualised and/or non-individualised) is distinguishable from corresponding intervention using placebos. METHODS: All facets of the review, including literature search strategy, study eligibility, data extraction and assessment of risk of bias, were described in an earlier paper. A trial was judged to comprise reliable evidence if its risk of bias was low or was unclear in specific domains of assessment. Effect size was reported as odds ratio (OR). A trial was judged free of vested interest if it was not funded by a homeopathic pharmacy. Meta-analysis was conducted using the random-effects model, with hypothesis-driven sensitivity analysis based on risk of bias. RESULTS: Nine of 15 trials with extractable data displayed high risk of bias; low or unclear risk of bias was attributed to each of the remaining six trials, only two of which comprised reliable evidence without overt vested interest. For all N = 15 trials, pooled OR = 1.69 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.12 to 2.56]; P = 0.01. For the N = 2 trials with suitably reliable evidence, pooled OR = 2.62 [95\% CI, 1.13 to 6.05]; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis provides some very limited evidence that clinical intervention in animals using homeopathic medicines is distinguishable from corresponding intervention using placebos. The low number and quality of the trials hinders a more decisive conclusion.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Systematic review of the research evidence in veterinary homeopathy has never previously been carried out. This paper presents the search methods, together with categorised lists of retrieved records, that enable us to identify the literature that is acceptable for future systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in veterinary homeopathy. METHODS: All randomised and controlled trials of homeopathic intervention (prophylaxis and/or treatment of disease, in any species except man) were appraised according to pre-specified criteria. The following databases were systematically searched from their inception up to and including March 2011: AMED; Carstens-Stiftung Homeopathic Veterinary Clinical Research (HomVetCR) database; CINAHL; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; Embase; Hom-Inform; LILACS; PubMed; Science Citation Index; Scopus. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty records were retrieved; 38 satisfied the acceptance criteria (substantive report of a clinical treatment or prophylaxis trial in veterinary homeopathic medicine randomised and controlled and published in a peer-reviewed journal), and were thus eligible for future planned systematic review. Approximately half of the rejected records were theses. Seven species and 27 different species-specific medical conditions were represented in the 38 papers. Similar numbers of papers reported trials of treatment and prophylaxis (n=21 and n=17 respectively) and were controlled against placebo or other than placebo (n=18, n=20 respectively). Most research focused on non-individualised homeopathy (n=35 papers) compared with individualised homeopathy (n=3). CONCLUSION: The results provide a complete and clarified view of the RCT literature in veterinary homeopathy. We will systematically review the 38 substantive peer-reviewed journal articles under the main headings: treatment trials; prophylaxis trials.},

However, this is a vastly under-researched area, and the research to date has been largely descriptive, in the form of case studies, or has used only small groups of participants with no control condition. Remarkably few studies have utilized gold standard randomized controlled designs. The aim of the present review was to examine the current state of the literature in regard to only randomized controlled trials (RCts) examining the psychosocial benefits of aaIs, which is a necessary step in order to move the field forward. A search of relevant databases was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and meta-analyses (PRISma) guidelines. A total of 66,180 articles were identified at the outset; this was reduced to eight articles (involving 7 studies), following the removal of duplicates (39,377), unrelated titles (26,525), and those that did not meet inclusion criteria (270). Findings from the present review suggest that aaIs may be of benefit to a wide range of individuals, including children with autism, and adults with psychological disorders, including schizophrenia. However, further research using well-designed RCts is required to more definitively explore what specific types of aaI are beneficial for specific populations.

In this study, we aim at summarizing the current knowledge on the influence of GIN infections on sheep production by conducting a systematic review. A subsequent meta-analysis of relevant studies was performed to provide an estimate of the effect of GIN infections on weight gain, wool production and milk yield. METHODS: A literature search was performed on the CAB, Pubmed and Web of Science database for the period 1960-2012. Inclusion criteria were: 1) Measurement of at least one production parameter. 2) Comparison between groups of sheep with different nematode burdens. 3) Same conditions regarding all aspects except parasite burden between groups. 4) Quantitative measurements of one or more production traits. RESULTS: Altogether, 88 studies describing 218 trials were included in this review. The majority of studies (86\%) reported that GIN infections had a negative effect on production but this was reported to be statistically significant in only 43\% of the studies. Meta-analysis indicated that performances of sheep infected with nematodes was 85, 90 and 78\% of the performance in uninfected individuals for weight gain, wool production and milk yield respectively. Our results suggest a possible reporting bias or small study effect for the estimation of the impact of GIN infections on weight gain. Finally, a general linear model provided an estimate for the decrease in weight gain in relation to the increase in faecal egg count of nematodes. CONCLUSION: This study underlines the importance of GIN infections for sheep production and highlights the need to improve parasite management in sheep, in particular in face of challenges such as anthelmintic resistance.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The EC Regulation for Organic Farming states that organic livestock should be treated preferably with phytotherapeutic products. In spite of the high importance of organic livestock in Europe, primarily ruminants, today almost no phytotherapeutic product is registered for livestock. Also, information regarding veterinary phytotherapy is rare. The aim of this paper is to find approaches to cope with health problems of organic ruminants in Europe on the basis of findings from the European ethnoveterinary medicine (EuEVM). METHODS: A systematic review of ethno-biomedicinal papers was conducted with the aid of the Scopus database, and 75 papers, from European countries were analyzed regarding ethnoveterinary information. RESULTS: A total of 590 plant species referring to 102 different plant families are reported to be used for animal treatment, with Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Lamiaceae being the most important families. The traditional use of some plant species (e.g. mallow, chamomile, wormwood) corresponds with findings from recent scientific literature. The large number of less studied plant species, such as white lupin as an antiparasitic herb, and Helleborus spp. as potential immunostimulatory agent, opens an interesting field for future research. CONCLUSIONS: In general, EuEVM provides interesting treatment approaches for gastrointestinal and dermatological disorders as well as parasitosis. Findings regarding disorders of female genital or respiratory tract are less consistent. Nevertheless, EuEVM offers a solid basis for stimulating research in veterinary phytotherapy in Europe with a perspective to solve animal health problems in organic or even nonorganic ruminant production.

	abstract = {Bovine paratuberculosis is a disease characterized by chronic granulomatous enteritis causing protein-losing enteropathy. Adverse effects on animal productivity are key drivers in the attempt to control paratuberculosis at the farm level. Economic models require an accurate estimation of the production effects associated with paratuberculosis. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of paratuberculosis on milk production. A total of 20 effect estimates from 15 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Substantial between-study heterogeneity was observed. Subgroup analysis by case definition and study design was carried out to investigate heterogeneity. The majority of between-study variation was attributed to studies that defined cases on serology. Calculation of a pooled effect estimate was only appropriate for studies that defined cases by organism detection. A reduction in milk yield, corrected for lactation number and herd of origin of 1.87kg/d, equivalent to 5.9\% of yield, was associated with fecal culture or PCR positivity in individual cows.},

We systematically reviewed published literature for evidence of a relationship between antimicrobial use in agricultural animals and drug-resistant foodborne campylobacteriosis in humans. Based on publications from the United States (U.S.), Canada and Denmark from 2010 to July 2014, 195 articles were retained for abstract review, 50 met study criteria for full article review with 36 retained for which data are presented. Two publications reported increase in macrolide resistance of Campylobacter coli isolated from feces of swine receiving macrolides in feed, and one of these described similar findings for tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones. A study in growing turkeys demonstrated increased macrolide resistance associated with therapeutic dosing with Tylan(R) in drinking water. One publication linked tetracycline-resistant C. jejuni clone SA in raw cow's milk to a foodborne outbreak in humans. No studies that identified farm antimicrobial use also traced antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter from farm to fork. Recent literature confirms that on farm antibiotic selection pressure can increase colonization of animals with drug-resistant Campylobacter spp. but is inadequately detailed to establish a causal relationship between use of antimicrobials in agricultural animals and prevalence of drug-resistant foodborne campylobacteriosis in humans.},

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Research questions relating to the accuracy of diagnostic techniques for meniscal injury and the effects of meniscal treatment were defined. An electronic database search of PubMed and CAB Abstracts was performed during March 2015. Data were extracted for study participants, design, intervention, outcome measures and results. Studies were evaluated using a validated instrument for assessing methodological quality and assigned a Quality Index score. A level of evidence was then assigned to each study. RESULTS: Eighty-nine studies were identified. The median Quality Index score was 14 out of a possible 26. Twenty-seven studies were prospective case series, 31 retrospective case series, 16 animal research and 15 cadaveric studies. There were no class I or class II studies, 27 class III and 62 class IV studies. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a large number of publications the quality of evidence was generally low. No one study or combination of studies provided high quality evidence to support one diagnostic or surgical intervention over another for meniscal injuries in dogs with cranial cruciate ligament failure.},

Here we examine post hunter-gatherer LUC as a driver of infectious disease in one biogeographical region with a compressed and documented history--continental Australia. We do this by examining land-use and native vegetation change (LUCC) associations with infectious disease emergence identified through a systematic (1973-2010) and historical (1788-1973) review of infectious disease literature of humans and animals. We find that 22\% (20) of the systematically reviewed EIDs are associated with LUCC, most frequently where natural landscapes have been removed or replaced with agriculture, plantations, livestock or urban development. Historical clustering of vector-borne, zoonotic and environmental disease emergence also follows major periods of extensive land clearing. These advanced stages of LUCC are accompanied by changes in the distribution and density of hosts and vectors, at varying scales and chronology. This review of infectious disease emergence in one continent provides valuable insight into the association between accelerated global LUC and concurrent accelerated infectious disease emergence.},

	abstract = {With the recent increase in interest in personality in dogs, behavioral assays of their behavior have proliferated. There has been particularly strong interest in predicting adult behavior from puppy tests. As a result, researchers and practitioners seeking to measure personality in puppies are faced with a bewildering array of options and no clear guide as to what behavioral assays have been developed or which personality dimensions those assays measure effectively. To address this issue, we used an 'expert-categorization' procedure-a standardized method often used in the course of meta-analyses-to identify the subset of those assays consensually judged to measure major personality dimensions effectively. We used this procedure to identify all relevant puppy tests and to categorize them in terms of their ability to measure nine personality dimensions identified in previous research (activity, aggressiveness, boldness/self-assuredness, exploration, fearfulness/nervousness, reactivity, sociability, submissiveness, trainability/responsiveness). Specifically, we identified 264 assay subtests, derived from 47 studies, which were subjected to a standardized categorization procedure undertaken independently by six expert judges. These procedures yielded a set of behavioral tests judged to measure the nine dimensions effectively and also demonstrated a widely applicable method for developing and evaluating behavioral test batteries.

	abstract = {The objective of this review was two-fold. First, a series of meta-analyses (analyses of treatment effects across studies) were performed on available data from scientific literature to determine whether sow behaviour, performance, or physiology differed for sows in group pens or individual stalls. Second, research publications in areas of performance and health, physiology, and behaviour of pregnant gilts and sows in studies that directly compared gestation sow housing systems were summarized. Common systems were stalls, tethers, and various types of group housing systems. Results of meta-analyses showed that the average levels of productivity, oral-nasal-facial behaviors (ONF), and blood cortisol were statistically similar for sows in group pens and stalls. For the review, in some studies, circulating cortisol concentrations were greater among gestating females kept in tethers compared with other systems; however, overall cortisol was not altered by housing system. Immune parameters were largely not influenced by housing system. Housing system did not alter heart rate. Gestation housing system may influence sow behaviour including stereotypic ONF, postural locomotory, feeding behaviors, or social behaviors. Overall, total ONF behaviors were comparable between gestation sow housing systems. However, tethered and stalled sows exhibited more stereotypic ONF compared with sows in group or outdoor systems. Compared with group housing, individually confining sows during gestation resulted in postural and movement restrictions. Stall size and design can impact postural adjustments and inter-stall aggression of individually housed sows. Inconsistent performance and health results were found among sow housing studies. Sows in stalls consistently had equal or greater reproductive performance compared with sows in other systems. Farrowing rate for sows in individual stalls was equal to or superior to sows in other systems. Farrowing rate was clearly superior among sows in stalls compared with group systems, where dynamic social groups were employed. However, tethered sows may have reduced litter size and increased piglet birth weight. Sows in group housing systems, particularly electronic sow feeder (ESF) systems, had injury scores greater than sows in either stalls or tethers. Gestation housing system (individual vs group) may impact sow welfare in the farrowing area (using stalls or pens). In conclusion, although individual studies found significant housing system effects, subjected to the overall evidence from adequately designed studies meta-analyses revealed that gestation stalls (non-tethered) or well-managed pens generally (but not in all cases) produced similar states of welfare for pregnant gilts or sows in terms of physiology, behaviour, performance, and health. More research is needed to develop and evaluate the efficacy of sow housing systems, including studies that directly compare sow housing systems using a multi-disciplinary approach.},

In Part II, a critical review of the economic impacts of the disease, risk factors, and important control measures are presented to enable Canadian bovine practitioners to successfully implement control strategies and participate in control programs. In cattle positive by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay, there is a 2.4 times increase in the risk of their being culled, and their lactational 305-day milk production is decreased by at least 370 kg. Reduced slaughter value and premature culling account for losses of CDN dollars 1330 per year per infected 50-cow herd. Research has failed to show a consistent association between Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis test status and reduced fertility or risk of clinical or subclinical mastitis. Host level factors include age and level of exposure, along with source of exposure, such as manure, colostrum, or milk. Agent factors involve the dose of infectious agent and strains of bacteria. Environmental management factors influence the persistence of the bacteria and the level of contamination in the environment. Emphasizing a risk factor approach, various control strategies are reviewed, including a number of national control programs currently in place throughout the world, specifically Australia, The Netherlands, and the United States. By reviewing the scientific literature about Johne's disease, control of the disease could be pursued through informed implementation of rational biosecurity efforts and the strategic use of testing and culling.},

CONCLUSIONS: Results from the 2 analyzers are not directly comparable and extrapolation of the results from one machine to the other should be avoided. Standardization of the preanalytical variables (eg, blood collection, holding time, and temperature during holding) is strongly recommended. It is recommended that each site create their own "site specific" reference values for each machine and that test samples be compared only to the standardized reference values established at that center. Start-up and consumable costs vary between countries and local comparisons should be performed. Decisions should be made based on the expected use of the machine and if multiple operators will be using it.},

CONCLUSIONS: Of the questions evaluated, only the association between anesthesia-related cardiopulmonary arrest and better outcomes was supported by strong evidence. There is some evidence from the human literature that the use of cognitive aids, standardized didactic, and hands-on training with high-fidelity simulators, team and leadership training, and post-cardiac arrest debriefing improve adherence to cardiopulmonary resuscitation guidelines and, in some cases, patient outcomes.

Forty-three publications from 1982 to 2004 with consistent intramuscular fat data were evaluated. Two studies were undertaken: 1) with fat thickness as a covariate and 2) with BW as a covariate. The intercept-slope covariance estimate was not statistically different from 0 for LM area (P = 0.11), KPH (P = 0.19), and intramuscular fat (P = 0.74) in study 1, and for LM area (P = 0.44), fat thickness (P = 0.11), KPH (P = 0.19), and intramuscular fat (P = 0.74) in study 2; therefore, a reduced model without a covariance component was fitted for these carcass characteristics. A covariance component was fitted for HCW (P = 0.01, study 1 and P = 0.05, study 2) and for intramuscular fat (P = 0.05, study 2). In study 1, the results for maturity indicated differences between early-moderate and late maturity for HCW (P {\textless} 0.01) and LM area (P {\textless} 0.01) but no differences for KPH (P = 0.26) and intramuscular fat (P = 0.50); for implant status, an estrogenic or combination implant increased HCW by 2.9\% (P = 0.27) or 4.8\% (P {\textless} 0.01), increased LM area by 3.2\% (P = 0.23) or 6.3\% (P {\textless} 0.01), decreased intramuscular fat by 8.1\% (P {\textless} 0.01) or 5.4\% (P {\textless} 0.01), respectively, and decreased KPH by 7.6\% (P = 0.34) for estrogenic implants but increased KPH by 1.1\% (P = 0.36) for combination implants, compared with nonimplanted steers. In study 2, the results at 600 kg of BW for implant status (implant or nonimplant) indicated no differences for HCW (P = 0.63) and LM area (P = 0.73), but there were differences for fat thickness (P {\textless} 0.01), KPH (P {\textless} 0.01), and intramuscular fat (P {\textless} 0.01); the results for maturity (early-moderate or late maturity) indicated no differences for HCW (P = 0.94), but there were differences for LM area (P {\textless} 0.01), fat thickness (P {\textless} 0.01), KPH (P {\textless} 0.01), and intramuscular fat (P {\textless} 0.01). The difference between early-moderate and late maturity (studies 1 and 2) confirmed that frame size accounts for a substantial portion of the variation in carcass composition. Studies 1 and 2 also indicate that implant status had significant effects on carcass quality.},

Forty-three publications reporting 51 studies (21 controlled studies (CS) and 30 challenge studies (ChS)) and 85 unique treatment comparisons were included in the review. The alternative treatment categories were nutraceuticals (28 studies), breeding for genetic resistance (12), nutritional manipulation (6), homeopathies (2), administration of copper oxide wire particles (2), and biological control (1). Random effect meta-analyses (MA) and meta-regression were performed with the natural logarithm of the difference in means (lnMD) between the control and treatment groups, for fecal egg counts per gram of wet feces (FEC), worm counts (WC) or fecal egg counts per gram of dry matter (FECDM) as the outcome. Treatment effect estimates (lnMD) were back-transformed to their count ratios (CR), a relative measure of effect for controlled versus treated groups, for presentation of results. Significant heterogeneity was observed for both CS and ChS that evaluated nutraceuticals, genetic resistance and nutrition treatments. MA of ChS that investigated nutraceuticals resulted in a significant overall CR of 1.62 (P{\textless}0.01) and 1.64 (P{\textless}0.01) for FEC and FECDM, respectively and a marginal significant CR of 1.14 (P=0.06) for WC, all favoring the treated groups. MA of CS and ChS that investigated genetic resistance resulted in a significant overall CR of 5.89 and 15.42, respectively (P{\textless}0.01), again favoring treated groups. MA of CS that investigated homeopathies with FEC as an outcome were homogenous (I(2)=0.0\%) and resulted in a non-significant pooled CR of 1.61. ChS investigating copper oxide wire particle treatments and WC as an outcome, were homogenous (I(2)=0.0\%) and had a marginally significant pooled CR of 1.68 (P=0.06). Publication bias was observed for ChS with WC outcomes, indicating that small size studies reporting non-significant CR, were less likely to be published than similar studies that found a significant CR. In a meta-regression, randomization (6.2\%) and study size (29.2\%) were the main factors contributing to the total variation when the outcome was FEC, and none of the variables contributed to between study heterogeneity. When the outcome was WC, type of treatment was the only significant covariate, explaining 6\% of the heterogeneity and 38.5\% of the total variation. The methodological soundness and reporting of primary research in the selected studies were low. Our results indicate that from the studied alternative treatments, nutraceuticals and use of genetically resistant sheep might be more promising for control of GINs in sheep.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to review systematically the range of assessment tools used in cats to detect the behavioural expression of pain and the evidence of their quality; and to examine behavioural metrics (considering both the sensory and affective domains) used to assess pain. METHODS: A search of PubMed and ScienceDirect, alongside articles known to the authors, from 2000 onwards, for papers in English was performed. This was followed by a manual search of the references within the primary data sources. Only peer-reviewed publications that provided information on the assessment tool used to evaluate the behavioural expression of pain in cats, in conscious animals (not anaesthetised cats), were included. RESULTS: No previous systematic reviews were identified. One hundred papers were included in the final assessment. Studies were primarily related to the assessment of pain in relation to surgical procedures, and no clear distinction was made concerning the onset of acute and chronic pain. Ten broad types of instrument to assess pain were identified, and generally the quality of evidence to support the use of the various instruments was poor. Only one specific instrument (UNESP-Botucatu scale) had published evidence of validity, reliability and sensitivity at the level of a randomised control trial, but with a positive rather than placebo control, and limited to its use in the ovariohysterectomy situation. The metrics used within the tools appeared to focus primarily on the sensory aspect of pain, with no study clearly discriminating between the sensory and affective components of pain. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Further studies are required to provide a higher quality of evidence for methods used to assess pain in cats. Furthermore, a consistent definition for acute and chronic pain is needed. Tools need to be validated that can detect pain in a range of conditions and by different evaluators (veterinary surgeons and owners), which consider both the sensory and emotional aspects of pain.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research regarding zoonotic diseases often focuses on infectious diseases animals have given to humans. However, an increasing number of reports indicate that humans are transmitting pathogens to animals. Recent examples include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, influenza A virus, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Ascaris lumbricoides. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of published literature regarding reverse zoonoses and highlight the need for future work in this area. METHODS: An initial broad literature review yielded 4763 titles, of which 4704 were excluded as not meeting inclusion criteria. After careful screening, 56 articles (from 56 countries over three decades) with documented human-to-animal disease transmission were included in this report. FINDINGS: In these publications, 21 (38\%) pathogens studied were bacterial, 16 (29\%) were viral, 12 (21\%) were parasitic, and 7 (13\%) were fungal, other, or involved multiple pathogens. Effected animals included wildlife (n = 28, 50\%), livestock (n = 24, 43\%), companion animals (n = 13, 23\%), and various other animals or animals not explicitly mentioned (n = 2, 4\%). Published reports of reverse zoonoses transmission occurred in every continent except Antarctica therefore indicating a worldwide disease threat. INTERPRETATION: As we see a global increase in industrial animal production, the rapid movement of humans and animals, and the habitats of humans and wild animals intertwining with great complexity, the future promises more opportunities for humans to cause reverse zoonoses. Scientific research must be conducted in this area to provide a richer understanding of emerging and reemerging disease threats. As a result, multidisciplinary approaches such as One Health will be needed to mitigate these problems.},

	abstract = {Cereal beta-glucan may be detrimental in pig production because of negative effects on nutrient digestibility, but they may act as functional ingredients by stimulating the intestinal microbiota. This study primarily aimed to investigate relations between dietary beta-glucan and nutrient digestibility, intestinal fermentation, and manure NH3 emission in weaned, growing, and finishing pigs. Effects of dietary xylose, NDF, and CP, and pig's BW on animal responses were also evaluated. A meta-analytical approach, accounting for inter- and intra-experiment variations, was used to compute prediction models. Data from 26 studies including 107 different dietary treatments with appropriate dietary and physiological measurements were used to parameterize these models. Dietary beta-glucan concentration ranged from 0 to 6.7\%. Increasing dietary beta-glucan reduced apparent ileal (AID) and total tract digestibility (ATTD) of CP and energy (R2 = 0.12 to 0.29; P {\textless} 0.05), whereas the ATTD of DM was reduced by 10\% up to a threshold beta-glucan level of 3.5\%, above which the response became asymptotic (R2 = 0.34; P {\textless} 0.01). Increasing dietary NDF content decreased ATTD of DM and energy, and increasing xylose concentration reduced ATTD of energy and CP (R2 = 0.24 to 0.85; P {\textless} 0.05). Broken-line model indicated that cecal total VFA and butyrate concentrations increased up to a threshold of 2.5 and 1.4\% beta-glucan in the diet, respectively, above which these responses became asymptotic (R2 = 0.77 to 0.96; P {\textless} 0.05). Ileal butyrate was negatively and colonic iso-butyrate was positively linked to increasing beta-glucan concentration (R2 = 0.17 to 0.41; P {\textless} 0.05). Greater beta-glucan concentration were negatively related (R2 = 0.86; P {\textless} 0.01) to NH3 emission, indicating a reduction in NH3 emission by half with 6\% beta-glucan. Backward elimination analysis indicated that greater BW of pigs counteracted (P {\textless} 0.05) the negative effect of beta-glucan on AID of CP and energy and ATTD of DM and CP. Pig's BW also enhanced effects of beta-glucan on cecal total VFA, colonic iso-butyrate, ileal butyrate, and NH3 emission (P {\textless} 0.05). Dietary CP level potentiated (P {\textless} 0.01) the beta-glucan effects on cecal total VFA, cecal butyrate, and colonic iso-butyrate. In conclusion, this study indicates that beta-glucan can stimulate cecal butyrate and ameliorate manure NH3 emission, thereby, decreasing nutrient digestibility. Because greater BW ameliorates beta-glucan effects, finishing diets may be formulated to contain more beta-glucan than weaner diets.},

Although extensive trypanosomiasis and tsetse (T\&T) control operations have been running since the beginning of the 20th century, Animal African Trypanosomiasis is still a major constraint of livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a systematic review of the existing literature describing T\&T control programmes conducted in a selection of five African countries, namely Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Ethiopia, Uganda and Zambia, between 1980 and 2015. Sixty-eight documents were eventually selected from those identified by the database search. This was supplemented with information gathered through semi-structured interviews conducted with twelve key informants recruited in the study countries and selected based on their experience and knowledge of T\&T control. The combined information from these two sources was used to describe the inputs, processes and outcomes from 23 major T\&T control programmes implemented in the study countries. Although there were some data gaps, involvement of the target communities and sustainability of the control activities were identified as the two main issues faced by these programmes. Further, there was a lack of evaluation of these control programmes, as well as a lack of a standardised methodology to conduct such evaluations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Past experiences demonstrated that coordinated and sustained control activities require careful planning, and evidence of successes, failures and setbacks from past control programmes represent a mine of information. As there is a lack of evaluation of these programmes, these data have not been fully exploited for the design, analyses and justification of future control programmes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews can serve as a tool in translation of basic life sciences research from laboratory to human research and healthcare. The extent to which reviews of animal research are systematic and unbiased is not known. METHODS: We searched, without language restrictions, Medline, Embase, bibliographies of known reviews (1996-2004) and contacted experts to identify citations of reviews of basic science literature which, as a minimum, performed search of a publicly available resource. From these we identified reviews of animal studies where laboratory variables were measured or where treatments were administered to live animals to examine their effects, and compared them with reviews of bench studies in which human or animal tissues, cell systems or organ preparations were examined in laboratories to better understand mechanisms of diseases. RESULTS: Systematic reviews of animal studies often lacked methodological features such as specification of a testable hypothesis (9/30, 30\%); literature search without language restriction (8/30, 26.6\%); assessment of publication bias (5/30, 16.6\%), study validity (15/30, 50\%) and heterogeneity (10/30, 33.3\%); and meta-analysis for quantitative synthesis (12/30, 40\%). Compared to reviews of bench studies, they were less prone to bias as they specified the question (96.6\% vs. 80\%, p = 0.04), searched multiple databases (60\% vs. 26.6\%, p = 0.01), assessed study quality (50\% vs. 20\%, p = 0.01), and explored heterogeneity (33.3\% vs. 2.2\%, p = 0.001) more often. CONCLUSION: There seems to be a gradient of frequency of methodological weaknesses among reviews: Attempted systematic reviews of whole animal research tend to be better than those of bench studies, though compared to systematic reviews of human clinical trials they are apparently poorer. There is a need for rigour when reviewing animal research.},

It remains difficult, however, to draw general conclusions about the effect of chronic heat stress on performance and its relationship with genetic and environmental factors, as these studies have been done under varying experimental conditions and using various experimental designs. A meta-analysis enabled us to make a quantitative review of the results from 131 published papers. The relative effects of four factors (genotype, age, group size, and amplitude of temperature variation) and their interactions with temperature were analyzed for 13 traits. After pre-correcting the data for a random study effect, the best model for each trait was selected in a stepwise procedure based on its residual sum of squares. Shell strength, daily feed intake, egg mass, and hen-day egg production were found to be more sensitive to heat stress than the other traits as they dropped by 9.0 to 22.6\% between thermo-neutrality (15 to 20 degrees C) and heat stress (30 to 35 degrees C) while yolk and albumen proportions or Haugh units showed nearly no variation with temperature ({\textless}1.2\% between thermo-neutrality and heat stress). Many interactions (17) were found between temperature and one or more factors in the 13 traits studied here, which reinforces the interest of using a meta-analysis to summarize data from the literature. This study highlighted that the impact of heat stress in laying hens depends on the genotype, age, and group size, some of which have rarely been investigated.},

	abstract = {Newcastle disease (ND) is one of the most important and widespread avian pests. In Africa, backyard poultry production systems are an important source of protein and cash for poor rural livelihoods. ND mortality in these production systems is important and seriously disrupts benefits derived from it. This study undertook an African continental approach of ND epidemiology in backyard poultry. After a systematic literature review of studies published from 1980 to 2009, a meta-analysis of spatio-temporal patterns of serological prevalence and outbreak occurrence was performed. Average ND serological prevalence was estimated at 0.67 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.58-0.75] in regions characterized by humid ecosystems, high human and poultry densities and low altitudes; 0.36 (95\% CI 0.30-0.41) in dry ecosystems at intermediate altitude where human and poultry densities are low and 0.27 (95\% CI 0.19-0.38) in mountain ecosystems where human and poultry densities are intermediate. In terms of seasonality, ND outbreaks occur mostly during the dry seasons in Africa, when environmental conditions are likely to be harshest for backyard poultry. In addition, a phylogeographical analysis revealed the regionalization of ND virus strains, their potential to evolve towards a higher pathogenicity from the local viral pool and suggests a risk for vaccine strains to provide new wild strains. These results present for the first time a continent-wide approach to ND epidemiology in Africa. More emphasis is needed for ND management and control in rural African poultry production systems.},

Materials and methods: A combined analysis (meta-analysis) was performed using all available, relevant data in a data set based on published and unpublished data. A total of 54 comparisons were made (pigs fed Bio-Mos or no Bio-Mos). The response to Bio-Mos throughout the experimental period was examined with either one or several independent variables in the model. Independent variables included weaning age, length of experiment, dietary Bio-Mos inclusion level, publication status, growth performance during the first nursery stage, antimicrobials in the diet, site of the experiment, and complexity of the first-stage diet. Analysis of variance was used to detect differences in the performance response to Bio-Mos between levels of a variable. Results: Overall, performance was better in pigs fed Bio-Mos than in the controls. The data indicate that pigs with a slow growth rate during the first 1 to 2 weeks postweaning have a more pronounced response to Bio-Mos than do pigs with a normal or accelerated growth rate. Dietary inclusion of Bio-Mos appears to be most effective immediately after weaning, but a smaller response may persist for several weeks. Implications: On the basis of this comprehensive analysis of all known available data, we conclude that Bio-Mos has potential as an acceptable growth promoter for nursery pigs.},

	abstract = {Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is a slow growing bacterium that can infect ruminants and remain latent for years without development of any clinical signs or disease. Diagnosis is often based on detection of MAP antibodies in milk or serum samples or culture of bacteria from faeces; however, these diagnostic tools are often not applicable until years after infection. Detection of MAP specific cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses can serve as an alternative and be implemented in a diagnostic tool. CMI responses can be measured at an early stage of infection, prior to development of antibodies and shedding of detectable amounts of MAP. At present, available diagnostic assays are limited by the lack of MAP specific antigens included in these assays resulting in poor specificity. The objective of this review is to provide a systematic overview of diagnostic MAP antigen candidates described to date with special emphasis on antigen candidates tested for CMI responses. Relevant information on 115 different MAP antigens was systematically extracted from literature and summarized in 6 tables of CMI antigens, secreted antigens, cell wall and membrane antigens, lipoprotein antigens, heat shock antigens and hypothetical antigens. Strategies for evaluation of novel antigen candidates are discussed critically. Relatively few of the described antigens were evaluated for their use in CMI based diagnostic assays and so far, no obvious candidate has been identified for this application. Most of the novel diagnostic candidates were evaluated in few animals and it is recommended that an appropriate sample size is included for evaluation of antigen candidates in future studies.},

	abstract = {Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis), the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis, has been identified in nine geographically distinct wildlife populations in North America and Hawaii and is endemic in at least three populations, including members of the Bovidae, Cervidae, and Suidae families. The emergence of M. bovis in North American wildlife poses a serious and growing risk for livestock and human health and for the recreational hunting industry. Experience in many countries, including the USA and Canada, has shown that while M. bovis can be controlled when restricted to livestock species, it is almost impossible to eradicate once it has spread into ecosystems with free-ranging maintenance hosts. Therefore, preventing transmission of M. bovis to wildlife may be the most effective way to mitigate economic and health costs of this bacterial pathogen. Here we review the status of M. bovis infection in wildlife of North America and identify risks for its establishment in uninfected North American wildlife populations where eradication or control would be difficult and costly. We identified four common risk factors associated with establishment of M. bovis in uninfected wildlife populations in North America, (1) commingling of infected cattle with susceptible wildlife, (2) supplemental feeding of wildlife, (3) inadequate surveillance of at-risk wildlife, and (4) unrecognized emergence of alternate wildlife species as successful maintenance hosts. We then propose the use of integrated and adaptive disease management to mitigate these risk factors to prevent establishment of M. bovis in susceptible North American wildlife species.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with alteration of the gut microbiota. In order to clarify the effect of Lactobacillus-containing probiotics (LCP) on weight we performed a meta-analysis of clinical studies and experimental models. We intended to assess effects by Lactobacillus species. METHODS: A broad search with no date or language restriction was performed. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and comparative clinical studies in humans and animals or experimental models assessing the effect of Lactobacillus-containing probiotics on weight. We primarily attempted to extract and use change from baseline values. Data were extracted independently by two authors. Results were pooled by host and by Lactobacillus species and are summarized in a meta-analysis of standardized difference in means (SMDs). RESULTS: We identified and included 17 RCTs in humans, 51 studies on farm animals and 14 experimental models. Lactobacillus acidophilus administration resulted in significant weight gain in humans and in animals (SMD 0.15; 95\% confidence intervals 0.05-0.25). Results were consistent in humans and animals. Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus ingluviei were associated with weight gain in animals. Lactobacillus plantarum was associated with weight loss in animals and Lactobacillus gasseri was associated with weight loss both in obese humans and in animals. CONCLUSIONS: Different Lactobacillus species are associated different effects on weight change that are host-specific. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of Lactobacillus species in the human energy harvest and weight regulation. Attention should be drawn to the potential effects of commonly marketed lactobacillus-containing probiotics on weight gain.},

	abstract = {Feline urine spraying inside the home is a common problem behaviour that owners seek advice for from veterinarians. Individual trials relating to a variety of interventions produce variable results, and to date, no consensus on the value of different treatments has emerged. This study therefore aimed to meta-analyse, current data from appropriate published clinical trials that evaluate treatments for feline urine spraying.Inclusion and exclusion criteria for study selection were predefined and methodological quality was assessed by two independent reviewers. Ten studies in nine publications that either evaluated pharmacotherapy or pheromonatherapy (the use of a synthetic analogue of the F3 facial fraction in the cat) were suitable for analysis. There was a significant (P{\textless}0.001) association between the use of any intervention and the number of cats that ceased or reduced urine spraying by at least 90\%. Analysis by intervention type indicated that fluoxetine, clomipramine and pheromonatherapy may each assist in managing urine spraying beyond a placebo based intervention.This is the first time meta-analytical techniques have been used and reported to evaluate the efficacy of interventions used in veterinary behavioural medicine, and it has established confidence in the value of both conventional treatments (pharmacotherapy) and a more recently developed treatment modality (pheromonatherapy) as an adjunct to the management of this problem. It is suggested that future research into treatment efficacy for this problem uses the benchmark standard of randomised, controlled trials lasting for at least 8 weeks, with the outcome criteria of cessation of feline urine spraying or reduction by at least 90\%.},

Considering the high prevalence of brucellosis, the aim of the current study was to systematically review published data about the annual incidence rate of this infection from different parts of Iran and provide an overall relative frequency (RF) for Iran using meta-analysis. We searched several databases including PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, google scholar, IranMedex and Iranian Scientific Information Database (SID) by using the following keywords: "Brucella", "Brucellosis", "Malta fever", "Mediterranean fever", "undulant fever", "zoonosis" and "Iran" in Title/Abstract/Keywords fields. Articles/Abstracts, which used clinical specimens and reported the incidence of brucellosis, were included in this review. Quality of studies was assessed by STROB and PRISMA forms. All statistical analyses were performed using STATA 11.0 (STATA Corp, College Station, TX) and P-values under 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Out of the 8326 results, we found 34 articles suitable, according to inclusion and exlusion criteria, for inclusion in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The pooled incidence of brucellosis was estimated 0.001\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.0005-0.0015\%) annually. Relative frequency of brucellosis in different studies varied from 7.0/100000 to 276.41/100000 in Qom and Kermanshah provinces, respectively. This systematic-review and meta-analysis study showed that the highest incidences of brucellosis are occurred in west and northwest regions of Iran. Totally, the incidence of the disease in Iran is in the high range.},

There were 194 animals from 17 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, of which 173 received a known dose of MAP and 21 were exposed naturally. Results from parametric time-to-event models indicated that challenging older calves or using multiple-exposure experimental systems resulted in a smaller proportion and shorter duration of early shedding as well as slower transition to late shedding from latent compartments. Calves exposed naturally showed variable infection progression rates, not dissimilar to other infection routes. The log-normal distribution was most appropriate for modelling infection-progression events. The infection pattern revealed by the modelling allowed better understanding of low-grade endemicity of MAP in cattle, and the parameter estimates are the basis for future transmission dynamics modelling.},

Legislation issues on burn experiments are discussed. CONCLUSION: The hot water was the main method to induce burns those of third degree on the back, with anesthesia using ketamine and xylazine, after depilation. These were evaluated microscopically, without using analgesia or an antibiotic during the postoperative period. The studies were not very reproducible.},

	abstract = {Previously observed relationships between dietary composition and production of a small number of individual milk fatty acids were the motivation to examine whether equations could be developed to predict production of all the major individual milk fatty acids. Such equations could be incorporated into ration formulation programs and used to examine factors that influence milk fat composition. Data from 29 published experiments on Holstein cows that provided 120 dietary treatments were entered into CPM-Dairy to obtain estimates of amounts of individual long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) absorbed from the intestines. These derived data and other dietary and animal data including the reported fatty acid composition of milk fat were entered into a spreadsheet. Descriptors of diet included daily intake of dry matter, total fermentable carbohydrate, total fatty acids, and profile of dietary fatty acids, intake of neutral detergent fiber, supplemental fish-oil, buffer, and magnesium oxide. Cow data included body weight and days in milk (DIM). Multiple linear regression was used to develop equations to predict the production (g/d) of each of 26 major LCFA. The equations developed generally had R(2) values in excess of 0.5. Production (g/d) of total de novo fatty acids (C4:0 to C15:0) (PTdenovo) was found to be positively related to the intake of fermentable carbohydrate, and negatively related to the intake of fish oil fatty acids and the estimated total amount of unsaturated fatty acids absorbed from the intestines. The PTdenovo was greater in pasture-fed cows than total mixed ration-fed cows and was negatively related to the square root of DIM. Production of each individual de novo fatty acid was described by a fixed proportion of PTdenovo. These proportions were 0.12 +/- 0.006 (C4:0), 0.083 +/- 0.0039 (C6:0), 0.0516 +/- 0.0025 (C8:0), 0.111 +/- 0.003 (C10:0), 0.134 +/- 0.0037 (C12:0), 0.441 +/- 0.007 (C14:0), 0.046 +/- 0.0024 (C14:1), and 0.0432 +/- 0.0017 (C15:0). Separate independent equations were developed to describe the daily production of C16:0, C16:1, and the main individual preformed fatty acids ({\textgreater}C16). The productions of each of the main individual pre-formed fatty acids were generally strongly related to the corresponding estimated amount (g/d) of specific fatty acids absorbed from the intestines. Percentage estimates for the direct transfer of the major absorbed LCFA to their corresponding LCFA in milk were 42\% (C16:0); 9.5\% (C18:0); 47.5\% (cis-9 C18:1); 16.1\% (all isomers of trans-C18:1), 38\% (cis-9, cis-12 C18:2); and 31\% (cis-9, cis-12, cis15 C18:3). High dietary intake of fish oil fatty acids was negatively associated with the production of all of the major individual preformed fatty acids with the exception of C20:5 and C22:6. In some instances, particular dietary factors were found to have positive influences on production of one fatty acid and negative influences on another. For example, high levels of dietary magnesium oxide were positively associated with production of C17 fatty acids but negatively associated with production of C18:0 and cis-9, trans-11 C18:2 (conjugated linoleic acid). This analysis quantified effects of major dietary and cow factors on production of individual fatty acids in milk.},

The influence of diet type (total mixed ration- vs. pasture-based diet) on concentrations of individual fatty acids was examined. Pairwise correlations for concentrations (g/kg) of individual fatty acids in milk showed that almost all of the individual de novo fatty acids were significantly correlated with each other and with the total concentration of de novo fatty acids. Concentrations of individual unsaturated preformed fatty acids were generally positively correlated with each other but were negatively correlated with concentrations of total de novo fatty acids. Substantial variation was found in the concentrations of individual milk fatty acids and, apart from those synthesized de novo, concentrations of individual fatty acids did not vary in concert. The adequacy of literature data for the development of a model to predict the production of the major individual fatty acids in milk is discussed. The limitations associated with the currently available studies that may be used in a predictive model are 1) failure of many publications to adequately describe dietary details, 2) reporting poorly defined milk fatty acids, 3) aggregating a number of closely related fatty acids under a single category, and 4) the selective reporting of only those fatty acids that are present in milk fat in appreciable quantities. Despite these limitations, the data are sufficient to enable development of a model to predict the concentrations and production of major individual fatty acids in milk fat. The extreme variability in concentrations of individual milk fatty acids and the complex matrix of positive and negative correlations among the concentrations of many individual fatty acids suggest that separate equations will be needed to predict the production of each individual milk fatty acid.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Q fever is a main zoonotic disease around the world. The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the overall seroprevalence of Coxiella burnetii among human and animal population in Iran. METHODS: Major national and international databases were searched from 2005 up to August 2016. We extracted the prevalence of Q fever antibodies (IgG) as the main primary outcome. We reported the prevalence of the seropositivity as point and 95\% confidence intervals. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of IgG phase I and II antibodies of Q fever in human was 19.80\% (95\% CI: 16.35-23.25\%) and 32.86\% (95\% CI: 23.80-41.92\%), respectively. The herd and individual prevalence of C. burnetii antibody in goat were 93.42\% (95\% CI: 80.23-100.00) and 31.97\% (95\% CI: 20.96-42.98\%), respectively. The herd and individual prevalence of Q fever antibody in sheep's were 96.07\% (95\% CI: 89.11-100.00\%) and 24.66\% (95\% CI: 19.81-29.51\%), respectively. The herd and individual prevalence of C. burnetii antibody in cattle were 41.37\% (95\% CI: 17.88-64.86\%) and 13.30\% (95\% CI: 2.98-23.62\%), respectively. Individual seropositivity of Q fever in camel and dog were 28.26\% (95\% CI: 21.47-35.05) and 0.55\% (0.03-2.68), respectively. CONCLUSION: Seroprevalence of Q fever among human and domestic animals is considerable. Preventative planning and control of C. burnetii infections in Iran is necessary. Active surveillance and further research studies are recommended, to more clearly define the epidemiology and importance of C. burnetii infections in animals and people in Iran.},

We reviewed 117 field estimates of parasite-induced nestling mortality in birds, showing that there was significant consistency in mortality among host and parasite taxa. Virulence increased towards the tropics in analyses of both species-specific data and phylogenetic analyses. We found evidence of greater parasite prevalence being associated with reduced virulence. Furthermore, bird species breeding in open nest sites suffered from greater parasite-induced mortality than hole-nesting species. By contrast, parasite specialization and generation time of parasites relative to that of hosts explained little variation in virulence. Likewise, there were little or no significant effects of host genetic variability, host sociality, host migration, host insular distribution or host survival on parasite virulence. These findings suggest that parasite-induced nestling mortality in birds is mainly determined by geographical location and to a smaller extent nest site and prevalence.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted to summarize the results of studies which have described the profiles of hormones during the oestrous cycle in buffalo using a fixed effect model and a random effect model. Plasma progesterone concentrations were lowest (0.30+or-0.06 ng/ml) during the peri-oestrous phase and increased (p=0.067) through the early luteal phase to a maximum concentration (1.94+or-0.03 ng/ml) during the mid-luteal phase. Circulating plasma inhibin and estradiol concentrations were lowest (0.31+or-0.01 and 11.04+or-0.13 ng/ml) during the mid-luteal phase, increased through the late luteal phase to maximum concentrations (0.44+or-0.02 and 22.48+or-0.32 ng/ml) during the peri-oestrous phase. Plasma FSH concentrations were lowest during the early luteal phase and increased through the mid-luteal phase to a maximum concentration during the peri-oestrous phase. Peripheral prolactin concentrations were lowest during the late luteal phase and increased to a maximum concentration during the peri-oestrous phase which then declined (p=0.716) during the early luteal phase. Peripheral plasma cortisol concentrations decreased from 2.68+or-0.14 ng/ml during the early luteal phase to 1.43+or-0.27 ng/ml during the mid-luteal phase (p{\textless}0.001) which then increased to 2.06+or-0.17 ng/ml during the late luteal phase. Plasma T3 concentrations decreased from the late luteal phase to the peri-oestrous phase (p{\textless}0.001) which then increased during the early luteal phase. T4 concentrations increased from the late luteal phase to the peri-oestrous phase which then decreased during the early luteal phase.},

	abstract = {The aim of this systematic review was to identify, assess, and critically evaluate the quality of evidence of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced adverse effects in dogs. Original prospective studies published in peer-reviewed journals in English (1990-2012) that reported data on the safety of NSAIDs administration in dogs were searched. For each study, design type (I, II, III, or IV) and assessment of quality (+, O, -) were rated. For each drug, quantity and consistency rating (***, **, *) and strength of evidence (high, moderate, low, or extremely low) were identified and evaluated. The strength of evidence was defined in terms of how applicable and relevant the conclusions were to the target population. Sixty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-five (55\%) research studies and 29 (45\%) clinical trials were identified. A high strength of evidence existed for carprofen, firocoxib, and meloxicam; moderate for deracoxib, ketoprofen, and robenacoxib; and low for etodolac. Quality and consistency rating were as follows: carprofen (***/***), deracoxib (**/***), etodolac (*/unable to rate), firocoxib (***/**), ketoprofen (**/***), meloxicam (***/***), and robenacoxib (**/**), respectively. Adverse effects were detected in 35 studies (55\%) and commonly included vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia. Three studies (5\%) reported a power analysis related to adverse effects of {\textgreater}/=80\%. In randomized, placebo-controlled, blinded studies (n = 25, 39\%), the incidence of adverse effects was not statistically different between treated and control dogs. Finally, most studies were not appropriately designed to determine the safety of NSAIDs, and involved a healthy nongeriatric population of research dogs.},

	abstract = {Bovine Leukemia virus (BLV) is a ubiquitous retrovirus that affects mainly cattle. Knowledge of the precise moment of infection is fundamental for identification and evaluation of factors related to BLV transmission. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide good evidence on the effects of medical interventions. The objectives were to estimate time to sero-conversion after experimental infection using data from retrieved literature and to detect factors that may influence the length of that interval using survival analysis on pooled data. An analysis using aggregate data from 36 studies totalling 438 observations was performed. From this, four sets were created and analysed by interval-censored accelerated failure time models (AFT) with different distributions (exponential, Weibull, log-logistic, lognormal and generalized gamma), and some variants of the Cox model (Andersen-Gill, smoothing splines) with and without a frailty effect. The AFT gamma model fit best and the estimated median time to sero-conversion in the null model was 57 days (95\% confidence interval (CI): 49; 75) using all data and 47 days (95\% CI: 39; 55) when only studies using experimental inoculation were considered. Some factors were consistently associated with time to sero-conversion. These included exposure by animal-to-animal contact (resulting in a seven-fold increase in time to sero-conversion compared to direct inoculation), diagnostic method to detect sero-conversion (time to sero-conversion was 1.4 times shorter when AGID was used compared to ELISA), and transmission by insect bites (biological media) delayed sero-conversion 2.3 times compared transmission via needles or other inanimate media. After fitting a frailty Cox model, results showed that sero-conversion in susceptible animals after infection using donors, in which presence of virus before the experiment started was confirmed, increased the hazard of sero-conversion two times in comparison with donors in which virus presence was not confirmed before start of the experiment. Inoculation with blood decreased the hazard 2.5 times in comparison with lymphocyte suspensions. Heterogeneity due to different research groups was also present. Finally, a Cox model with smoothing splines contained three variables: research group, route of inoculation and a non-linear spline for infective dose. In conclusion, it can be stated some factors that influence the time to sero-conversion were identified and quantified and that a moderate influence of research centre existed. These results may contribute to the estimation of the most probable times of infection in field conditions and in a better evaluation of control measures.},

The recent emergence of multidrug-resistant S. pseudintermedius isolates, in particular methicillin-resistant strains (MRSP) is a threat to small animal health and highlights the need for antimicrobial resistance surveillance to detect trends and potentially perform timeous interventions. We systematically reviewed 202 published articles to investigate temporal changes in antimicrobial resistance in clinical and commensal S. pseudintermedius isolated from dogs in 27 countries between 1980 and 2013. Resistance to the most common antimicrobials tested for in published studies and important for the treatment of staphylococcal infections in dogs were assessed separately for methicillin resistant (MRSP) and methicillin susceptible (MSSP) isolates. Stratified by MSSP and MRSP, no significant increases in antimicrobial resistance were observed over time, except for the penicillinase-labile penicillins (penicillin and ampicillin) among MSSP. However, in recent years, a few studies have reported higher-level of resistance to amikacin, gentamicin and enrofloxacin amongst MSSP. The review highlights inconsistencies between studies as a result of several factors, for example the use of different antimicrobial susceptibility testing methods and interpretation criteria. We recommend that data on susceptibility in important companion animal pathogens are collected and presented in a more harmonized way to allow more precise comparison of susceptibility patterns between studies. One way to accomplish this would be through systematic surveillance either at the country-level or at a larger scale across countries e.g. EU level.},

	abstract = {Early detection of cancers, although essential for treatment effectiveness, can be difficult to achieve, and some tests introduce additional health risks. New, non-invasive detection methods with greater sensitivity and specificity are needed. Several authors have published research suggesting that dogs may be able to detect lung, breast, prostate, ovarian, and melanoma cancers by smelling skin lesions, urine, exhaled breath, and surgically extracted tumors. We conducted a systematic search using the PubMed and EMBASE databases to identify all known published data on canine scent detection of cancers. Of 531 potentially relevant publications, 11 full text articles were examined, and 5 were selected for inclusion in the review. Two studies involved dogs detecting breast cancer (sensitivity 88\% using exhaled breath and 22\% using urine; specificity was 98\% and 20\%, respectively), 1 involved bladder cancer (41\% of urine samples detected), 1 involved melanoma (75-85.7\% of in situ tumors detected), 1 involved lung cancer (sensitivity 99\% and specificity 99\% using exhaled breath), 1 involved ovarian cancer (sensitivity 100\% and specificity 97.5\% using thawed frozen tumor samples), and 1 involved prostate cancer (18\% of urine samples detected). One study on ovarian cancer is in progress. Early successes with canine scent detection suggest chemical analysis of exhaled breath may be a valid method for cancer detection. Tests using exhaled breath showed better sensitivity and specificity than with urine. Future research should target other tumor types, and seek to identify what exhaled compounds may signal a cancer diagnosis.},

Sixty-eight articles/reports from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Mozambique, Tanzania and Zambia were reviewed. The majority of these articles were from Tanzania. There is an increasing trend in the incidence of antibiotic resistance; of major concern is the increase in multidrug- resistant Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholera, non-typhoid Salmonella and other pathogens responsible for nosocomial infections. The increase in methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers in the countries under review confirms the spread of these clones worldwide. Clinical microbiology services in these countries need to be strengthened in order to allow a coordinated surveillance for antimicrobial resistance and provide data for local treatment guidelines and for national policies to control antimicrobial resistance. While the present study does not provide conclusive evidence to associate the increasing trend in antibiotic resistance in humans with the use of antibiotics in animals, either as feed additives or veterinary prescription, we strongly recommend a one-health approach of systematic surveillance across the public and animal health sectors, as well as the adherence to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization)-OIE (World Organization of animal Health) -WHO(World Health Organization) recommendations for non-human antimicrobial usage.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systematic reviews of preclinical studies, in vivo animal experiments in particular, can influence clinical research and thus even clinical care. Dissemination bias, selective dissemination of positive or significant results, is one of the major threats to validity in systematic reviews also in the realm of animal studies. We conducted a systematic review to determine the number of published systematic reviews of animal studies until present, to investigate their methodological features especially with respect to assessment of dissemination bias, and to investigate the citation of preclinical systematic reviews on clinical research. METHODS: Eligible studies for this systematic review constitute systematic reviews that summarize in vivo animal experiments whose results could be interpreted as applicable to clinical care. We systematically searched Ovid Medline, Embase, ToxNet, and ScienceDirect from 1st January 2009 to 9th January 2013 for eligible systematic reviews without language restrictions. Furthermore we included articles from two previous systematic reviews by Peters et al. and Korevaar et al. RESULTS: The literature search and screening process resulted in 512 included full text articles. We found an increasing number of published preclinical systematic reviews over time. The methodological quality of preclinical systematic reviews was low. The majority of preclinical systematic reviews did not assess methodological quality of the included studies (71\%), nor did they assess heterogeneity (81\%) or dissemination bias (87\%). Statistics quantifying the importance of clinical research citing systematic reviews of animal studies showed that clinical studies referred to the preclinical research mainly to justify their study or a future study (76\%). DISCUSSION: Preclinical systematic reviews may have an influence on clinical research but their methodological quality frequently remains low. Therefore, systematic reviews of animal research should be critically appraised before translating them to a clinical context.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cutaneous infections with bacteria and yeasts are common in small animal practice. Treatment with systemic antibiotics or antifungal agents may not be ideal, because of the increasing development of multiresistant organisms, the cost and the possible adverse effects. Topical antimicrobials may be used as adjunctive therapy to systemic treatment or as sole therapy instead of systemic treatment. OBJECTIVE: This literature review evaluated studies on topical antimicrobial treatment of skin infections. METHODS: In vitro and in vivo studies evaluating topical antimicrobial agents were identified using a number of electronic and manual searches of textbooks and articles. Studies were evaluated, and the evidence for or against the use of the topical agents was extracted. RESULTS: There is good evidence for the efficacy of chlorhexidine and, to a lesser degree, benzoyl peroxide in canine bacterial skin infections. There is limited evidence for the efficacy of silver sulfadiazine and medical honey against bacterial skin infections in the dog, and for the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide and stannous fluoride in the horse. Good evidence supports the use of a combination of chlorhexidine and miconazole in dogs with cutaneous Malassezia infections. There is insufficient evidence to recommend any other topical therapy for use in cutaneous infections. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Although many antimicrobial topicals are marketed in veterinary dermatology, the efficacy has been reported for only a minority of agents. Randomized controlled trials evaluating various topical treatments are therefore urgently needed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of the veterinary literature investigating IV fluid therapy in dogs, cats, horses, and cattle. DESIGN: Systematic review. PROCEDURES: The preferred reporting of items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA-P) was employed for systematic review of all relevant IV fluid therapy manuscripts published from January 1969 through December 2016 in the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux International (CABI) database. Independent grading systems used to evaluate manuscripts included the updated CONsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials 2012 checklist, risk of bias for animal intervention studies, criteria for levels of evidence, and methodological quality (Jadad scale). The quality of articles published before and after 2010 was compared. RESULTS: One hundred and thirty-nine articles (63 dogs, 7 cats, 39 horses, 30 cattle) from 7,258 met the inclusion criteria. More than 50\% of the manuscripts did not comply with minimal requirements for reporting randomized controlled trials. The most non-compliant items included identification of specific predefined objectives or a hypothesis, identification of trial design, how sample size was determined, randomization, and blinding procedures. Most studies were underpowered and at risk for selection, performance, and detection bias. The overall quality of the articles improved for articles published after 2010. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Most of the veterinary literature investigating the administration of IV fluid therapy in dogs, cats, horses, and cattle is descriptive, does not comply with standards for evidence, or provide adequate translation to clinical practice. Authors should employ and journal editors should enforce international consensus recommendations and guidelines for publication of data from animal experiments investigating IV fluid therapy.},

	abstract = {The use of small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS; also known as "drones") for professional and personal-leisure use is increasing enormously. UAS operate at low altitudes ({\textless}500 m) and in any terrain, thus they are susceptible to interact with local fauna, generating a new type of anthropogenic disturbance that has not been systematically evaluated. To address this gap, we performed a review of the existent literature about animals' responses to UAS flights and conducted a pooled analysis of the data to determine the probability and intensity of the disturbance, and to identify the factors influencing animals' reactions towards the small aircraft. We found that wildlife reactions depended on both the UAS attributes (flight pattern, engine type and size of aircraft) and the characteristics of animals themselves (type of animal, life-history stage and level of aggregation). Target-oriented flight patterns, larger UAS sizes, and fuel-powered (noisier) engines evoked the strongest reactions in wildlife. Animals during the non-breeding period and in large groups were more likely to show behavioral reactions to UAS, and birds are more prone to react than other taxa. We discuss the implications of these results in the context of wildlife disturbance and suggest guidelines for conservationists, users and manufacturers to minimize the impact of UAS. In addition, we propose that the legal framework needs to be adapted so that appropriate actions can be undertaken when wildlife is negatively affected by these emergent practices.},

METHODS: A search using PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar was performed, followed by secondary searches of veterinary trade journals, bibliographies of relevant articles, manufacturer websites, and technical reference guides. Randomized experimental trials in healthy horses were considered that included both a treatment and control group. The endpoint required was euthanasia or laparoscopy to identify adhesion formation. A meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model, with the effect size calculated as an odds ratio (OR) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical significance was set at P{\textless}.05. RESULTS: Out of 354 peer reviewed publications that met the search criteria, a total of 9 relevant studies were identified and investigated the use of sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) solutions, sodium hyaluronate/carboxymethylcellulose (HA/CMC) membranes, hyaluronate (HA), and fucoidan solutions. The odds of adhesions in horses treated with an adhesion barrier were significantly lower than untreated controls (OR=0.102; 95\% CI [0.041, 0.254]; P{\textless}.001). When analyzed as subsets for each type of barrier, horses treated with HA/CMC membranes and CMC solutions had significant OR for fewer adhesions (OR=0.061; 95\% CI [0.013, 0.292]; OR=0.119; 95\% CI [0.034, 0.415], respectively; P{\textless}.001). CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis demonstrated adhesion barriers provide a positive effect on the odds of adhesion formation. These results are tempered by the limitations of the study, including the small sample size and a bias towards publication of studies with only positive findings.},

Eight databases were searched for peer-reviewed original Arabic, English, French and Persian journal articles; the search was conducted on June 2014. Two reviewers evaluated articles for inclusion based on pre-defined criteria. Of 451 research articles, only 87 articles passed the screening process and provided bacteriological and serological evidence for brucellosis in all Middle Eastern countries. Brucella melitensis and B. abortus have been identified in most countries in the Middle East, supporting the notion of widespread presence of Brucella spp. especially B. melitensis across the region. Of the 87 articles, 49 were used to provide evidence of the presence of Brucella spp. but only 11 provided new knowledge on the frequency of brucellosis in humans and ruminants or on human risk factors for seropositivity and were deemed of sufficient quality. Small ruminant populations in the region show seroprevalence values that are among the highest worldwide. Human cases are likely to arise from subpopulations occupationally exposed to ruminants or from the consumption of unpasteurized dairy products. The Middle East is in need of well-designed observational studies that could generate reliable frequency estimates needed to assess the burden of disease and to inform disease control policies.},

Linear regression for the reported compounds indicated no strong or predictive correlations to human data for all species, individually and combined. The lack of correlation in this extended dataset highlights that animal bioavailability is not quantitatively predictive of bioavailability in human.

Electronic searches were carried out using PubMed MEDLINE(R), CABDirect and CONSULTANT database. The volumes of Advances in Veterinary Dermatology, the proceedings of ESVD/ECVD and AAVD/ACVD congresses were hand-searched for studies relevant to this review. All articles and book chapters discussing treatment of Malassezia dermatitis were scanned for additional citations. Lastly, a request was sent to the Vetderm Listserv to share recent clinical trials. The analysis evaluated study design, methodology quality, subject enrolment quality, type of interventions and outcome measures. The searches identified 35 articles, and 14 trials that fulfilled the following selection criteria: (i) in vivo clinical trials, (ii) dogs showing clinical lesions of Malassezia dermatitis and (iii) enrolment of at least five dogs. Among these, only eight studies fulfilled the following additional criterion: (iv) prospective in vivo clinical trials reporting clinical and mycological outcome measures. A total number of 14 different treatment protocols included four blinded, randomized and controlled trials (quality of evidence grade A), four controlled studies lacking blinding and/or randomization (grade B), five open uncontrolled trials (grade C) and one descriptive study (grade D). This systematic review allowed us to recommend, with good evidence, the use of only one topical treatment of Malassezia dermatitis (2\% miconazole nitrate +2\% chlorhexidine, twice a week for 3 weeks) and with fair evidence the use of two systemic treatments with azole derivatives (ketoconazole, 10 mg kg(-1) day(-1) and itraconazole, 5 mg kg(-1) day(-1) for 3 weeks).},

	abstract = {Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is an important reproductive pathogen of cattle worldwide. The reproductive outcome of BVDV infection is largely dependent on the immune status of the dam and the stage of gestation at the time of infection. Potential sequelae include failure of conception, abortion, a variety of congenital malformations, and fetal infection. Vaccination is a possible tool in the control of BVDV, and there has been a recently renewed focus on providing fetal protection through vaccination. Consequently, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of BVDV vaccination to prevent reproductive disease by performing a quantitative synthesis of previously published studies. Pertinent articles to be included in the analysis were identified by performing a search in four relevant scientific databases (PubMed, CAB abstracts, National Agricultural Library catalog, and Web of Science) and examining the reference lists of 10 germane review articles. Inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis mandated that the studies were controlled, primary studies that included necessary data for use in the meta-analysis (e.g., group size, number of abortions). Forty-six studies in 41 separate articles matched the inclusion criteria. Risk ratio effect sizes were used in random effects, weighted meta-analyses to assess the impact of BVDV vaccination on three outcomes: risk of fetal infection, abortion risk, and pregnancy risk. Within each outcome, subanalyses were performed to evaluate the effect of a variety of interventions, including modified live, inactivated, polyvalent and monovalent vaccination, homologous, heterologous, or field challenge, and studies with only bovine subjects. The analysis revealed a decrease in abortions of nearly 45\% and a nearly 85\% decrease in fetal infection rate in cattle vaccinated for BVDV compared with unvaccinated cohorts. Additionally, pregnancy risk was increased by approximately 5\% in field trials of BVDV vaccinates. This meta-analysis provides quantitative support for the benefit of vaccination in the prevention of BVDV-associated reproductive disease.},

	abstract = {The prevention and control of Campylobacter colonization of poultry flocks are important public health strategies for the control of human campylobacteriosis. A critical review of the literature on interventions to control Campylobacter in poultry on farms was undertaken using a systematic approach. Although the focus of the review was on aspects appropriate to the United Kingdom poultry industry, the research reviewed was gathered from worldwide literature. Multiple electronic databases were employed to search the literature, in any language, from 1980 to September 2008. A primary set of 4,316 references was identified and scanned, using specific agreed-upon criteria, to select relevant references related to biosecurity-based interventions. The final library comprised 173 references. Identification of the sources of Campylobacter in poultry flocks was required to inform the development of targeted interventions to disrupt transmission routes. The approach used generally involved risk factor-based surveys related to culture-positive or -negative flocks, usually combined with a structured questionnaire. In addition, some studies, either in combination or independently, undertook intervention trials. Many of these studies were compromised by poor design, sampling, and statistical analysis. The evidence for each potential source and route of transmission on the poultry farm was reviewed critically, and the options for intervention were considered. The review concluded that, in most instances, biosecurity on conventional broiler farms can be enhanced and this should contribute to the reduction of flock colonization. However, complementary, non-biosecurity-based approaches will also be required in the future to maximize the reduction of Campylobacter-positive flocks at the farm level.},

	abstract = {Human-directed dog aggression is a worldwide issue with major public health and animal welfare implications. Consequences for the target of aggression range from fear and minor injury, to life threatening injury and death, and for the dog impaired freedoms, restricted interactions and ultimately euthanasia. The systematic review undertaken here aimed to identify and assimilate all robust evidence regarding factors that affect the risk of human-directed dog aggression. Such information is vital for the development of sound preventive strategies. Multiple electronic literature databases were interrogated in order to identify all evidence for risk factors of human-directed dog aggression. The search strategy was designed to minimise the risk of publication and language biases, specificity was sacrificed for sensitivity. The threshold for acceptance of evidence was predetermined at a moderate level; any study that provided evidence with a low risk of confounding and bias and a moderate probability that any relationship identified was causal would reach the final review. Appraisal examined methodological quality, study design, selection process, measurement of outcome and exposures, and type and quality of analysis. All stages of appraisal were undertaken blind to the study findings. On assimilating the evidence identified, no robust evidence for any risk factors of human-directed dog aggression was identified. Eight studies provided a moderate level of somewhat conflicting evidence. Amongst those studies appraised as failing to reach the moderate level of acceptable evidence, the majority were excluded as a result of multiple limitations. It is vital that future research is undertaken to a high methodological standard in order that it provides robust evidence for the effect of any risk factor identified.},

	abstract = {Prevalence estimates are used by decision makers such as policy makers and risk assessors to make choices related to certain diseases and infections. Paratuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), is a chronic infection particularly resulting in economic losses among farmed ruminants. Therefore, this infection is of concern for many farming industry decision makers. As a result, multiple studies have been carried out to determine the within-herd and between-herd prevalence of MAP infections. The objective of the present study was to conduct a review and, if possible, compare animal and herd level prevalences of MAP among farmed animals in Europe. European data on prevalences of MAP in all farmed animal species were included from a review of literature. Information on target population and study design, tests used and apparent prevalences were recorded, and subsequently true prevalences were calculated when possible. A critical review of the included studies indicated that although a wide range of studies have been conducted, likely and comparable true prevalence estimates could rarely be calculated. Based on a few studies where the prevalences appeared to be plausible, it was concluded that prevalences of MAP would have to be guesstimates based on available data. The true prevalence among cattle appeared to be approximately 20\% and was at least 3-5\% in several countries. Between-herd prevalence guesstimates appeared to be {\textgreater}50\%. No countries had published sufficient information to claim freedom from MAP or just a near-zero prevalence of MAP infections. No within-flock prevalence estimates were available for goats and sheep. The between-flock prevalence guesstimates were {\textgreater}20\%, based only on estimates from Switzerland and Spain. Major critical issues were identified in the majority of the studies, primarily due to lack of knowledge of the test accuracy of the diagnostic test used, or due to studies where the study population did not reflect the target population. Because most of the reported studies did not yield prevalence estimates which were comparable to other studies, there is a continuing need for well-designed studies of the prevalence of MAP infections.},

	abstract = {Infections with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) can be latent for years without affecting the animal, but the animal may become infectious or clinical at some point. Diagnosis of paratuberculosis can be a challenge primarily in latent stages of the infection, and different diagnosis interpretations are usually required by the variety of decision makers. The objective of this paper was to provide a critical review of reported accuracies of ELISA tests, interferon-gamma assays (IFN-gamma) and faecal culture (FC) techniques used for diagnosis of three defined target conditions: MAP infected, MAP infectious and MAP affected animals. For each animal species, target condition and diagnostic test-type, sensitivities (Se) and specificities (Sp) were summarised based on a systematic, critical review of information in literature databases. The diagnostic test information often varied substantially for tests of the same type and make, particularly ELISA, which was the most frequently reported test-type. Comparison of the various tests accuracies was generally not possible, but stratification of test-evaluations by target condition improved the interpretation of the test accuracies. Infectious and affected animals can often be detected, but Se for infected animals is generally low. A main conclusion of the review was that the quality of design, implementation and reporting of evaluations of tests for paratuberculosis is generally poor. Particularly, there is a need for better correspondence between the study population and target population, i.e. the subjects chosen for test evaluation should reflect the distribution of animals in the population where the test is intended to be used.},

Coinfection of humans, domestic animals, wildlife, and ticks with both B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum appears to be common, yet the pathologic mechanisms and ecology remain poorly understood compared with single-agent infection. We compiled available literature describing experimental and naturally occurring coinfection with B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum in I. ricinus-complex ticks and host species, including wildlife, humans, livestock, and pets; calculated odds ratios for coinfection risks; evaluated the hypotheses that odds ratios for coinfection differ significantly between different tick life stages, ticks and vertebrate hosts, and reservoir and nonreservoir hosts; and finally, calculated the predicted coinfection prevalence based on the probability of each pathogen alone and compared this to the reported coinfection prevalence. Sixty-one manuscripts referenced coinfection or coexposure between these pathogens, with prevalence estimates for coinfection up to 67\% in vertebrates and 28\% in ticks. Of 61 different reports of coinfection or coexposure, 18 had odds ratios for coinfection significantly higher than 1. The combined odds ratios for coinfection in vertebrates and ticks were 1.9 and 1.28, respectively, with statistically significant variability among host and tick species in odds ratios. The overall predicted coexposure prevalence for vertebrates was 3.1\% compared with an observed 8.9\% prevalence. Odds ratios were not significantly different among classes of vertebrate hosts, species of ticks, stages of ticks, or ticks compared with hosts. We confirm a considerable level of coinfection and coexposure with these pathogens, although not predictably across host or tick species or geographical region.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Q fever is a neglected zoonosis caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii. The knowledge of the epidemiology of Q fever in Kenya is limited with no attention to control and prevention programs. The purpose of this review is to understand the situation of Q fever in human and animal populations in Kenya in the past 60 years, and help identify future research priorities for the country. METHODS: Databases were searched for national and international scientific studies or reports on Q fever. We included studies and reports published between 1950 and 2015 if they reported on Q fever prevalence, incidence, and infection control programs in Kenya. Data were extracted with respect to studies on prevalence of Coxiella infections, study design, study region, the study populations involved, and sorted according to the year of the study. RESULTS: We identified 15 studies and reports which qualified for data extraction. Human seroprevalence studies revealed evidence of C. burnetii infections ranging from 3 to 35.8\% in all regions in which surveys were made and two Q fever outbreak episodes. Coxiella burnetii infections found in cattle 7.4-51.1\%, sheep 6.7-20\%, camels 20-46\%, and goats 20-46\% revealed variation based on ecoregions and the year of study. Farming and lack of protective clothing were associated with increased seropositivity among humans. However, high quality data is lacking on Q fever awareness, underlying cultural-economic factors influencing C. burnetii infection, and how the pathogen cycles may be embedded in livestock production and management systems in the economically and ecologically different Kenyan regions. We found no studies on national disease incidence estimates or disease surveillance and control efforts. CONCLUSION: Coxiella burnetii infections are common in human and in a wide range of animal populations but are still unrecognized and underestimated thus presenting a significant human and animal health threat in Kenya. The factors influencing pathogen transmission, persistence and spread are poorly understood. Integrated disease surveillance and prevention/control programs are needed in Kenya.},

The aim of this systematic review was to identify and evaluate the evidence of efficacy of interventions for treatment or prevention of canine visceral leishmaniasis, and to propose recommendations for or against their use. Forty-seven articles describing clinical trials published between 1980 and 2004 fulfilled selection criteria. The evaluation of clinical trials provided good evidence for recommending the use of meglumine antimoniate at a minimum dosage of 100 mg kg(-1) daily for at least 3-4 weeks, combined with allopurinol in order to obtain a good clinical efficacy and a reduced relapse rate. The evaluation of the articles also provided fair evidence for recommending the use of pentamidine (4 mg kg(-1) twice weekly) and aminosidine (5 mg kg(-1) twice daily) for 3-4 weeks. There was insufficient evidence for recommending the use of allopurinol alone, amphotericin B, buparvaquone, ketoconazole, enrofloxacin, and the combinations of metronidazole with spiramicyn or metronidazole with enrofloxacin. Fair evidence against the use of aminosidine at high dosages (20-80 mg kg(-1) per day) was proposed due to its side effects. Evaluation of articles on repellent measures against sand fly vectors of leishmaniasis provided good evidence for recommending deltamethrin collars and fair evidence for recommending spot-on permethrin.},

Clinical trials were included if Pseudomonas species were cultured from the ears of dogs with otitis externa or otitis media prior to treatment, and if the outcome of these interventions was reported at the end of the study. Studies were compared with regard to design characteristics (randomization generation and concealment, masking, intention-to-treat analyses), benefit (microbiological and/or clinical resolution of the Pseudomonas otitis), and adverse effects. Ten trials reporting data on 162 patients and 13 different pharmacological interventions were identified. Based on the accepted criteria for quality of evidence, there is insufficient evidence for or against recommending the use of any of these treatments for Pseudomonas otitis in dogs. This is largely because there is only one trial supporting the use of each treatment option and none were randomized controlled trials. Future studies need to be prospective, randomized, blinded and controlled; designed to evaluate pharmacological interventions for otitis regardless of the infective organism; have appropriate statistical advice on recruitment numbers, the power of the study and appropriate statistical analysis; include details of underlying conditions and concomitant treatments; and be designed such that inclusion criteria include microbial culture and antimicrobial sensitivity, and outcome assessments include clinical examination, cytology and microbial culture.},

These procedures are usually performed without pain mitigation. The objective of this project was to develop recommendations for pain mitigation in 1- to 28-day-old piglets undergoing these procedures. The National Pork Board funded project to develop recommendations for pain mitigation in piglets. Recommendation development followed a defined multi-step process that included an evidence summary and estimates of the efficacies of interventions. The results of a systematic review of the interventions were reported in a companion paper. This manuscript describes the recommendation development process and the final recommendations. Recommendations were developed for three interventions (CO₂/O₂ general anesthesia, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and lidocaine) for use during castration. The ability to make strong recommendations was limited by low-quality evidence and strong certainty about variation in stakeholder values and preferences. The panel strongly recommended against the use of a CO₂/O₂ general anesthesia mixture, weakly recommended for the use of NSAIDs and weakly recommended against the use of lidocaine for pain mitigation during castration of 1- to 28-day-old piglets.},

	abstract = {This review summarizes evidence for associations between Salmonella prevalence in market-weight swine and changes in feeding management practices or feed characteristics. A systematic review of the topic was conducted with the goal of minimizing the impact of bias on the review conclusions. Potential interventions included feed withdrawal from swine prior to slaughter, feed acidification, heat treatment of feed, pelletized feed versus mash, course versus fine grind, and wet versus dry feeds. In the reviewed literature, Salmonella prevalence was measured either by culture or by the presence of antibodies to Salmonella. The evidentiary value of studies was assessed, and studies that failed to meet predetermined standards were excluded. 7694 potentially relevant references were identified by an extensive literature search; however, 2623 references that were not published in English were excluded, because funds for translation were not available. Of the remaining references, only 277 were considered relevant to the review topic by two independent reviewers, and assessed for methodological quality. During quality assessment, 233 references were excluded because they failed to report design features that limit the introduction of bias or were conducted in a non-target population such as gnotobiotic, neonatal, nursery, or recently weaned pigs and sows. Forty-four publications passed the quality assessment conducted by 2 independent reviewers, but only 15 of the 44 publications reported studies that tested hypotheses associated with feeding management practices and feed characteristics and Salmonella prevalence in market-weight swine. The most common study design was cross-sectional (7/15). The included studies failed to provide strong evidence of an association between any of the potential interventions and Salmonella prevalence, due to the potential for confounding, and the failure to document temporal association between the intervention and Salmonella prevalence. The strongest evidence of an association was found for feed form, i.e. the use of non-pelleted may be potential interventions associated with reduced Salmonella prevalence. The uncertainty is primarily based on studies containing moderate to low evidentiary value or insufficient numbers of tested individuals, resulting in a low degree of confidence that results could be extrapolated to the target population. Therefore, the conclusion of the review is that there should be a low level of comfort among qualified scientists that the claimed association between non-pelleted feed and reduced Salmonella prevalence is scientifically valid. There is no strong evidence regarding associations between presence of Salmonella and the other feed characteristics examined.},

Relevant studies documented Salmonella spp. prevalence at more than one processing point using the same cohort of pigs or the same production line for the post-cooler component. Literature searches retrieved 6811 citations. Sixteen publications, describing 44 studies, evaluated the presence of Salmonella on pork carcasses. The carcass sampling points evaluated were as follows: stun, bleed, kill, scald, dehair, singe, polish, bung removal, evisceration, split, stamp, final wash, immediately after chill, and 18-48 h after chilling. Seventy-eight comparisons of Salmonella spp. prevalence between points along the processing line were reported. The median prevalence of Salmonella spp.-positive carcasses evaluated in the cooler was 0\%. The median prevalence of Salmonella spp. after bleeding was 32\%. Fifty-nine of the 78 point-to-point comparisons were associated with either no change or a decrease in Salmonella prevalence as the carcass moved closer to the cooler. Nineteen point-to-point changes showed an increase in Salmonella prevalence as the carcass moved toward the cooler; of these, six reported a greater than 10\% increase in Salmonella prevalence. The majority of increases were associated with post-evisceration and splitting. These findings suggest that the processing procedures in place generally result in decreased prevalence of Salmonella spp. as the carcasses move toward the cooler.},

A search was conducted to identify all manuscripts relating to antibiotic treatment of cattle with IBK.

Studies which failed to use methods such as blinding, blocking or randomization to minimize bias were excluded from the review. The initial search yielded 196 manuscripts, of which nine described high-quality, randomized clinical trials. These manuscripts reported antibiotic treatment of IBK with florfenicol, ceftiofur, oxytetracycline, procaine penicillin G, procaine penicillin G and dexamethasone, tilmicosin, or benzathine cloxacillin compared to either a placebo control or a non-medicated control. Overall, the studies suggest that antibiotic treatment is successful in reducing healing times of IBK-associated corneal lesions. Very few manuscripts reported a direct comparison of different antibiotic classes, so it was not possible to make comparative evaluations of efficacy. This review demonstrates the need for further randomized controlled trials that evaluate the efficacy of antibiotic treatment for IBK, including direct comparisons of two or more antibiotics.},

DESIGN: Systematic review. SAMPLE POPULATION: 29 manuscripts (41 studies) reporting antimicrobial treatment of BRD in North American feedlot cattle. PROCEDURES: A search of the electronic citation databases AGRICOLA, Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau, and PubMed was conducted to identify relevant manuscripts published between 1970 and 2005. Key study design features were extracted by 2 reviewers. RESULTS: 12 of 29 (41\%) manuscripts did not disclose a funding source, and 21 (72\%) had an author clearly identified as an employee of a pharmaceutical company. At the study level, 36 of 41 (88\%) studies reported a random method of treatment allocation, 9 (22\%) described the method of allocation sequence generation, 20 (49\%) reported that study investigators were blinded to treatment, and 3 (7\%) included a study size justification. No studies described the null hypothesis to be tested. Thirty-seven (90\%) studies reported at least 3 outcomes; the largest number of outcomes reported was 14. It was not possible to conduct the statistical analysis as originally planned because it was not possible to discern the primary outcome for the majority of studies. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Many studies did not report key study design features that would assist critical evaluation by readers. It was not clear whether the studies failed to use the design features or failed to report them. Several nondesign features, such as reporting of the null hypothesis, a primary outcome, and sample size rationale, represent relatively new standards for reporting; however, reporting these features would substantially clarify the study objective.},

This paper presents a systematic review of the empirical research on AAI for ASD. Fourteen studies published in peer-reviewed journals qualified for inclusion. The presentation of AAI was highly variable across the studies. Reported outcomes included improvements for multiple areas of functioning known to be impaired in ASD, namely increased social interaction and communication as well as decreased problem behaviors, autistic severity, and stress. Yet despite unanimously positive outcomes, most studies were limited by many methodological weaknesses. This review demonstrates that there is preliminary "proof of concept" of AAI for ASD and highlights the need for further, more rigorous research.},

	abstract = {Animals have a long history of inclusion in psychiatric treatment. There has been a recent growth in the empirical study of this practice, known as Animal-Assisted Intervention (AAI). We conducted a systematic review of the empirical literature on AAI for trauma, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Ten studies qualified for inclusion, including six peer-reviewed journal articles and four unpublished theses. Participants were predominantly survivors of child abuse, in addition to military veterans. The presentation of AAI was highly variable across the studies. The most common animal species were dogs and horses. The most prevalent outcomes were reduced depression, PTSD symptoms, and anxiety. There was a low level of methodological rigor in most studies, indicating the preliminary nature of this area of investigation. We conclude that AAI may provide promise as a complementary treatment option for trauma, but that further research is essential to establish feasibility, efficacy, and manualizable protocols.},

The public health importance of vaccination against C. burnetii shedding from sheep and goats was evaluated using systematic review and meta-analysis to provide evidence for policy direction to prevent potential zoonotic spread. Publications reporting shedding of C. burnetii in vaginal and uterine secretions, milk, placenta and faeces were included. A single observational (one goat) and seven experimental (four goat and three sheep) vaccine studies were included in the review. No relevant publications on other interventions were identified. Random effects meta-analyses were performed for the risk of shedding in individuals in the control and vaccinated groups and for the mean difference in the level of bacterial shedding in sheep and goats stratified by age and previous exposure status. Limited data were available for further analytic evaluation. From the pooled analysis, an inactivated phase I vaccine significantly reduced the risk of shedding from uterine (RR = 0.10; 95\%CI 0.05-0.20) secretions in previously sensitized goats. Individual studies reported significant risk reduction in milk (RR = 0.03; 95\%CI 0.01-0.26), vaginal secretions (RR = 0.40; 95\%CI 0.22-0.75) and faeces (RR = 0.79; 95\%CI 0.63-0.97) from naive goats. The pooled mean levels of bacteria shed from placental [mean difference (MD = -5.24 Log10 ; 95\%CI -6.75 to -3.7)] and vaginal (MD = -1.78 Log10 ; 95\%CI -2.19 to -1.38) routes were significantly decreased in vaccinated naive goats compared with controls. Shedding through all other routes from vaccinated goats was not significantly different than shedding from control goats. No effect of vaccination was found on the risk of shedding or the mean level of shedding in vaccinated sheep compared with control sheep. Our conclusions are based on a limited amount of data with variable risk of systematic error.},

Pasteurization effectively reduces the MAP load by four to five logs, but the efficacy depends on the MAP concentration, which depends on the prevalence among contributing herds and individuals. Considerable variation of MAP in bulk tank milk (BTM) and individual cow's milk (IM) is reported, but factors associated with MAP occurrence in milk at farm level have not been described. This study systematically reviewed published studies aiming at estimating the occurrence of MAP in on-farm BTM and IM by meta-analysis. A total of 692 articles were identified through electronic databases and initially screened using title and abstract. The quality of the 61 potentially relevant articles was assessed using full text and 31 articles were eventually included in the meta-analysis. The apparent prevalence (AP) of MAP in BTM and IM on farm were summarized in relation to strata defined by the test used to identify MAP and the infection status of the herds/animals. There was considerable inconsistency in the reporting, resulting in missing information potentially explaining the dispersion in the estimated AP. The overall AP and 95\% confidence intervals based on PCR and culture of MAP were summarized to 0.10 (0.04-0.22) in BTM and 0.20 (0.12-0.32) in IM. Quantifying the MAP load in test-positive milk samples was not possible because very few articles provided quantitative information on individual samples.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The management of atopic dermatitis (AD) in dogs relies mainly on the use of interventions to reduce pruritus and skin lesions. OBJECTIVES: To provide a critical analysis of recent clinical trials reporting the efficacy and safety of interventions for canine AD. METHODS: Systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published, presented or completed between 2008 and 2011, which enrolled dogs with AD. The search was done using electronic databases, reviewing published meeting abstracts and sending queries to professional email lists. Trials reporting the efficacy of interventions aimed at treating, preventing or reducing glucocorticoid usage in atopic dogs were selected. RESULTS: Twenty-one RCTs were included. We found further moderate-quality evidence of efficacy and safety of oral glucocorticoids and ciclosporin for treatment of canine AD. There was additional moderate-quality evidence of the efficacy of a topical glucocorticoid spray containing hydrocortisone aceponate. Low-quality evidence was found for the efficacy and safety of injectable recombinant interferons, a budesonide leave-on conditioner, a ciclosporin topical nano-emulsion and oral fexofenadine. There is low-quality evidence of efficacy of oral masitinib, with a need for monitoring for protein-losing nephropathy. Finally, we uncovered low-quality evidence of efficacy of a commercial diet as a glucocorticoid-sparing intervention and of a glucocorticoid spray as a flare-delaying measure. Very low-quality evidence was found for the efficacy of other interventions. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Topical or oral glucocorticoids and oral ciclosporin remain the interventions with highest evidence for efficacy and relative safety for treatment of canine AD.},

	abstract = {Several hydrolysate-based diets have been commercialized for helping diagnose or treat dogs with cutaneous adverse food reactions (CAFR). This systematic review was performed to examine the evidence in favour of reduced immunological and clinical allergenicity of hydrolysates in dogs with CAFR. Citation databases, meeting abstracts and article bibliographies were scanned for relevant citations, and companies were contacted to provide unpublished reports. Eleven studies relevant to this study were identified. Some evidence of reduced serum IgE binding to a soy hydrolysate (1 study) and decreased intradermal test reactivity to hydrolysed proteins (three studies) was found. In four reports, the feeding of dogs suspected of having CAFR with hydrolysate-based diets reduced or eliminated clinical signs in a variable proportion of subjects. The percentage of dogs with CAFR that still reacted to these hydrolysate-based diets could not be assessed, however. Importantly, up to 50\% of dogs with CAFR enrolled in three controlled studies exhibited increases in clinical signs after ingesting partial hydrolysates derived from foods to which they were hypersensitive. In conclusion, the limited number of studies undertaken point to reduced – but not eliminated – immunological and clinical allergenicity of hydrolysate-based commercial diets. A variable proportion of dogs with CAFR will exhibit a worsening of clinical signs when fed partial hydrolysates. Clinicians must weigh the clinical benefit of these diets versus their high cost and low risk of reduced appetence or gastrointestinal sign development. At this time, hydrolysate-containing diets are probably best used in dogs suspected not to be hypersensitive to their individual components.},

Citations identified from three databases (MEDLINE, Thomson's Science Citation Index Expanded and CAB Abstracts) and trials published by December 2007 were selected. Proceedings books from the major veterinary dermatology international congresses were hand searched for relevant citations. The authors selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published from January 1980 to December 2007, which reported the efficacy of topical or systemic interventions for treatment or prevention of canine AD. Studies had to report assessments of either pruritus or skin lesions, or both. Studies were selected and data extracted by two reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by a third arbitrator. Missing data were requested from study authors of recently published trials. Pooling of results and meta-analyses were performed for studies reporting similar interventions and outcome measures. A total of 49 RCTs were selected, which had enrolled 2126 dogs. This review found some evidence of efficacy of topical tacrolimus (3 RCTs), topical triamcinolone (1), oral glucocorticoids (5), oral ciclosporin (6), subcutaneous recombinant gamma-interferon (1) and subcutaneous allergen-specific immunotherapy (3) to decrease pruritus and/or skin lesions of AD in dogs. One high-quality RCT showed that an oral essential fatty acid supplement could reduce prednisolone consumption by approximately half. Additional RCTs of high design quality must be performed to remedy previous flaws and to test interventions for prevention of flares of this disease.},

RESULTS: The search for, and review and analysis of the best evidence available as of December 14, 2014 suggests that, by 5 weeks in dogs and 6 weeks in cats after starting an elimination diet, more than 80 \% of patients had achieved a remission of clinical signs of CAFR. Increasing the diet trial duration to 8 weeks leads to a complete remission in more than 90 \% of dogs and cats with CAFR. CONCLUSIONS: For diagnosing CAFRs in more than 90 \% of dogs and cats, elimination diet trials should last at least 8 weeks.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anti-allergic drugs (e.g. antihistamines, glucocorticoids and ciclosporin) are often administered to dogs with atopic dermatitis to relieve pruritus and skin lesions. Allergen-specific intradermal tests (IDT) and allergen-specific IgE serological (ASIS) tests are used to characterize the allergens to which dogs are hypersensitive. Anti-allergic drugs have the potential to influence the results or interpretation of these tests. OBJECTIVES: To provide evidence-based recommendations for anti-allergic drug withdrawal times before IDT and ASIS tests. METHODS: Three citation databases and abstracts from international meetings were searched for relevant studies. Studies were grouped based on similar interventions and types of tests. Withdrawal times for each type of drug and test were then extrapolated from the study results. RESULTS: Before the assessment of immediate reactions to IDT, proposed optimal withdrawal times for antihistamines, oral glucocorticoids, topical/otic glucocorticoids and ciclosporin are 7, 14, 14 and 0 days, respectively. Studies have provided no evidence for drug withdrawal prior to ASIS tests for oral ciclosporin or prednisone/prednisolone. Owing to a lack of studies, recommendations for withdrawal times before ASIS tests cannot be made for topical glucocorticoids and antihistamines. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: These proposed withdrawal times are based on the existing evidence at the end of 2011. Care must be taken before extrapolating the suggested withdrawal times to other species, higher dosages, different formulations and/or durations of administration of tested drugs, as well as to other medications from the same category.},

	abstract = {Cattle are kept as an important source of livelihood in many Kenyan farming households whilst also having cultural and social value. A review was undertaken to estimate productivity in the three main Kenyan cattle production systems: small-scale dairy and meat; small-scale dairy; and large-scale dairy and meat. Data on production parameters were collected through a systematic literature search of electronic databases for peer reviewed and grey literature. The parameters included were reproductive rates, mortality rates and yields. Prices for livestock and livestock products were estimated from markets. The data were used to estimate net output from cattle using the Livestock Productivity Efficiency Calculator (LPEC), a deterministic steady state model which measures productivity as net output per megajoule (MJ) of metabolisable energy (ME). The estimated net outputs per livestock unit year(-1) were USD 146.6, USD 215.1 and USD 84.8 in the large-scale dairy and meat, small-scale dairy and meat and small-scale dairy systems, respectively. Milk production contributed significantly to net output in all systems and was 91.8 \% of total output in small-scale dairy. Cattle sales had the highest contribution to net output in large-scale dairy and meat system (45.1 \%). Sensitivity analysis indicated that output was most affected by milk yield, age and weight at maturity and parturition rate. The productivity differences between the production systems call for more detailed research on the constraints to the production systems such as diseases, and to describe the benefits that farmers and society would obtain from disease control and improved management.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human echinococcosis is a neglected zoonosis caused by parasites of the genus Echinococcus. The most frequent clinical forms of echinococcosis, cystic echinococcosis (CE) and alveolar echinococcosis (AE), are responsible for a substantial health and economic burden, particularly to low-income societies. Quantitative epidemiology can provide important information to improve the understanding of parasite transmission and hence is an important part of efforts to control this disease. The purpose of this review is to give an insight on factors associated with echinococcosis in animal hosts by summarising significant results reported from epidemiological studies identified through a systematic search. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The systematic search was conducted mainly in electronic databases but a few additional records were obtained from other sources. Retrieved entries were examined in order to identify available peer-reviewed epidemiological studies that found significant risk factors for infection using associative statistical methods. One hundred studies met the eligibility criteria and were suitable for data extraction. Epidemiological factors associated with increased risk of E. granulosus infection in dogs included feeding with raw viscera, possibility of scavenging dead animals, lack of anthelmintic treatment and owners' poor health education and indicators of poverty. Key factors associated with E. granulosus infection in intermediate hosts were related to the hosts' age and the intensity of environmental contamination with parasite eggs. E. multilocularis transmission dynamics in animal hosts depended on the interaction of several ecological factors, such as hosts' population densities, host-prey interactions, landscape characteristics, climate conditions and human-related activities. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Results derived from epidemiological studies provide a better understanding of the behavioural, biological and ecological factors involved in the transmission of this parasite and hence can aid in the design of more effective control strategies.},

	abstract = {To evaluate the efficacy of melatonin implants on increasing the production of lambs, a meta-analysis was performed based on the results of 139 experiments carried out in Spain and published in 56 scientific publications or conference proceedings. To assess the effects on fertility, the relative risk (RR) was calculated and, in the case of prolificacy and fecundity, the analysis was based on raw mean difference (\_D\_) and the standardized difference between means (\_d\_) and their corresponding confidence intervals. In addition, the experiments were stratified by the productive aptitude of the flocks, breed, time of year, and age. For fertility, the mean RR was 1.29, which indicated that the treatment with melatonin increased significantly (by 29\%) the probability of pregnancy. For prolificacy, overall \_D\_ was 0.08 (\_d\_=0.9089); \_i.e.\_, the groups treated with melatonin increased their litter size by 0.08 lambs/lambing relative to the control groups. Ultimately, treatment with melatonin increased fecundity significantly (0.25 extra lambs/ewe treated) (\_d\_=6.3188), and this trend was evident in all of the stratified datasets. In all cases, there was significant (\_p\_{\textless}0.001) heterogeneity and bias. In conclusion, in Spain, melatonin implants had a significant effect on the probability that a ewe became pregnant, increased the number of lambs born per lambing, which ultimately increased the number of lambs born per treated ewe. In addition to confirm the results of previous descriptive reviews in the scientific literature, the metaanalysis made use of a statistical tool that synthesizes and estimates more precisely the effect of this hormone on sheep reproduction.},

In addition to careful horse farm management, vaccination is the only known alternative to reduce the RVA associated disease burden on horse farms. The precise evaluation of vaccine effectiveness against circulating strains needs enhanced surveillance of equine RVAs in areas where vaccine is already available or vaccine introduction is anticipated. Therefore, we undertook the overview of relevant information on epidemiology of equine RVA strains through systematic search of public literature databases. Our findings indicated that over 99\% of equine RVA strains characterized during the past three decades belonged to two common genotypes, G3P[12] and G14P[12], whereas most of the minority equine RVA strains were probably introduced from a heterologous host by interspecies transmission. These baseline data on RVA strains in horses shall contribute to a better understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of strain prevalence in vaccinated and non-vaccinated herds.},

DESIGN: Systematic review. STUDY POPULATION: Controlled studies published between 1996 and 2004. PROCEDURES: PubMed was searched with the following keywords, used alone and in combination: educational alternatives, nonlethal teaching methods, veterinary alternatives, medical education, and nonterminal animal use. Cited references of retrieved reports were reviewed to identify additional reports. Reports were selected for review only if a comparison group was included. RESULTS: 17 studies that were randomized controlled trials or nonrandomized trials that included a comparison group were identified. Five involved veterinary students, 3 involved medical students, 6 involved university undergraduate students, and 3 involved high school biology students. Sample size ranged from 14 to 283 students. Eleven studies appeared to be randomized, parallel-group trials, 4 involved comparative groups to which participants were not randomly assigned or for which the randomization process was not clear, 1 was a 2-period crossover study, and 1 involved a retrospective review of grades. In all 17 studies reviewed, results associated with the alternative method of instruction were not significantly different from or superior to results associated with the conventional method. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although the number of controlled studies identified was small, the results seem to support more widespread adoption of alternative teaching methods in biomedical education.},

Differences in responses between 2 commonly used RPM products, Mepron (Evonik Industries, Hanau, Germany) and Smartamine (Adisseo, Antony, France), were investigated as well as dietary and animal factors that could influence responses. Diets were coded with respect to the amino acid (AA) deficiency of the control diet as predicted by the AminoCow model (version 3.5.2, http://www.makemilknotmanure.com/aminocow.php; 0=no AA deficiency, 1=Met deficiency, 2=Met and Lys deficiency, 3=Met and Lys plus at least 1 other AA deficiency) to test the effect of AA deficiencies on RPM response. Thirty-five studies were identified, 17 studies evaluating Mepron, 18 studies evaluating Smartamine, and 1 study evaluating both. This permitted 75 dietary comparisons between control and RPM-added diets. Diets were entered into the AminoCow and the 2001 National Research Council models to compare predictions of Met, Lys, and metabolizable protein (MP) flow. Mean Met and Lys in diets where RPM was fed were estimated to be 2.35 and 6.33\% of MP, respectively. Predictions of flows between models were similar. Overall, RPM addition to diets increased production of TMP, both as percentage (0.07\%) and yield (27 g/d). Dry matter intake and milk fat percentage were slightly decreased, whereas milk production was slightly increased. Differences between products were detected for all production variables, with Mepron-fed cows producing less TMP percentage but greater milk production, resulting in twice as much TMP yield. Milk protein response to RPM was not related to predicted AA deficiency, calculated Met deficiency, or Met as a percentage of MP. Other dietary factors, including Lys flow (g/d), Lys as percentage of MP, neutral detergent fiber percentage, crude protein percentage, or energy balance, had no detectable effects on TMP response. When cows with a predicted positive AA balance were fed RPM, milk production increased, but when AA balance was negative, milk production decreased. Amount of RPM added to the diet was not correlated to TMP response. This study does not support the necessity of a high Lys level as a prerequisite to obtaining a TMP response to feeding RPM or the MP requirement suggested by the National Research Council model (2001). However, more dose-response studies over a wide range of milk production and dietary regimens will be required to more clearly establish AA requirements and to predict responses to RPM supplementation.},

	abstract = {Cyathostomins are the most important gastrointestinal nematode infecting equids. Their effective control is currently under threat due to widespread resistance to the broad spectrum anthelmintics licenced for use in equids. In response to similar resistance issues in other helminths, there has been increasing interest in alternative control strategies, such as bioactive plant compounds derived from traditional ethnoveterinary treatments. This study used an evidence-based approach to evaluate the potential use of plant extracts from the UK and Ethiopia to treat cyathostomins. Plants were shortlisted based on findings from a literature review and additionally, in Ethiopia, the results of a participatory rural appraisal (PRA) in the Oromia region of the country. Systematic selection criteria were applied to both groups to identify five Ethiopian and four UK plants for in vitro screening. These included Acacia nilotica (L.) Delile, Cucumis prophetarum L., Rumex abyssinicus Jacq., Vernonia amygdalina Delile. and Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal from Ethiopia and Allium sativum L. (garlic), Artemisia absinthium L., Chenopodium album L. and Zingiber officinale Roscoe. (ginger) from the UK. Plant material was collected, dried and milled prior to hydro-alcoholic extraction. Crude extracts were dissolved in distilled water (dH2O) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), serially diluted and screened for anthelmintic activity in the larval migration inhibition test (LMIT) and the egg hatch test (EHT). Repeated measures ANOVA was used to identify extracts that had a significant effect on larval migration and/or egg hatch, compared to non-treated controls. The median effective concentration (EC-50) for each extract was calculated using PROBIT analysis. Of the Ethiopian extracts A. nilotica, R. abyssinicus and C. prophetarum showed significant anthelmintic activity. Their lowest EC-50 values were 0.18 (confidence interval (CI): 0.1-0.3), 1.1 (CI 0.2-2.2) and 1.1 (CI 0.9-1.4)mg/ml, respectively. All four UK extracts, A. sativum, C. album, Z. officinale and A. absinthium, showed significant anthelmintic activity. Their lowest EC-50 values were 1.1 (CI 0.9-1.3), 2.3 (CI 1.9-2.7) and 0.3 (CI 0.2-0.4)mg/ml, respectively. Extract of A. absinthium had a relatively low efficacy and the data did not accurately fit a PROBIT model for the dose response relationship, thus an EC-50 value was not calculated. Differences in efficacy for each extract were noted, dependent on the assay and solvent used, highlighting the need for a systematic approach to the evaluation of bioactive plant compounds. This study has identified bioactive plant extracts from the UK and Ethiopia which have potential as anthelmintic forages or feed supplements in equids.},

Since the establishment of the etiologic role of L. intracellularis, a number of specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have been developed for the detection of DNA in feces. The present article is a systematic review of peer-reviewed publications on the application of L. intracellularis-specific fecal PCR as an antemortem diagnostic test for histologic lesions of PE in pigs. Based on this information, a range of diagnostic sensitivities (36-100\%) and specificities (50-100\%) of the published tests was calculated. Validity and confidence limits of the estimates varied considerably. The positive and negative predictive values of 6 different PCR assays were calculated for PE prevalence of 15\%, 30\%, 45\%, 60\%, 75\%, and 90\%, using a histologic case definition of PE and based on the reported test sensitivities and specificities. The simulated predictive values suggested that applying the fecal PCR assay as a diagnostic test is more likely to overestimate than underestimate the number of pigs having histologic lesions of PE under field conditions.},

METHODS: A systematic review found original studies in the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS up to November 2012 and in complementary sources up to February 2013. Studies were evaluated in accordance with QUADAS 2 and STARD parameters and recommended in accordance with GRADE parameters. Meta-analysis was carried out with MetaDiSc software, using the random effect model. RESULTS: 284 studies were identified, of which 25 met the inclusion criteria, comprising the final synthesis. All but one were done in Brazil, and only 2 were judged to be of good quality. 15 studies involving immuno-enzymatic tests with crude antigens (cELISA), 11 studies on indirect immunofluorescence tests (IFAT) and 3 on the immunochromatographic dual path platform (DPP) test were meta-analysed. The combined results for sensitivity and specificity were: cELISA: 0.89 (CI 95\% 0.87 to 0.91) and 0.87 (CI 95\% 0.86 to 0.88); IFAT: 0.88 (CI 95\% 0.85 to 0.91) and 0.63 (CI 95\% 0.61 to 0.65) and DPP: 0.83 (CI 95\% 0.78 to 0.88) and 0.73 (CI 95\% 0.70 to 0.75). CONCLUSION: cELISA and DPP tests have moderate accuracy for the diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis, and the quality of the design, implementation and analysis of validation studies on diagnostic tests for this disease urgently require improvement. The recommendation for use of the evaluated tests is based on evidence that is scarce and restricted to Brazil.},

The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy of vaccines for bovine mastitis caused by S. aureus and suggest the immunotherapeutic protocols that have achieved the best and/or most promising results. An electronic search was made of the PubMed and Web of Science databases in November 2009. Only studies that tested vaccines in vivo in cows were included. The experimental design, methodological quality, type of vaccine and results of the studies were analyzed. Twenty-four papers were selected for this review. In general, bacterin-toxoid vaccines, vaccines of DNA-recombinant protein and recombinant protein alone were investigated in the studies selected. This systematic review suggests that vaccines that employ new technologies (DNA and/or recombinant protein vaccines) and some long-standing bacterins have achieved good results, which supports their use in the prevention and control of bovine mastitis caused by S. aureus.

	abstract = {Daily pasture allowance (PA) is defined as the product of pregrazing pasture mass and offered area, and is the major grazing management factor determining pasture utilization per unit area and daily performance of grazing dairy cows. The objective of the present study was to perform a meta-analysis reviewing the effect of PA on pasture intake, milk production, milk composition, and grazing behavior of dairy cows. Experiments studying the effect of PA on pasture intake or milk production, which eventually included milk composition or grazing behavior data, or both, were selected to create a database. Papers were selected only if at least 2 PA were compared under the same experimental conditions, particularly the same pasture mass (i.e., where PA levels were only obtained through changes in daily offered area). The final database included 97 PA comparisons reported in 56 papers. For analytical purposes, the database was subdivided into 3 subsets that varied according to the estimation height (EH) at which PA was determined; that is, PA above ground level (PA0 subset), PA above 2.5 to 3.5cm (PA3 subset), and PA above 4 to 5cm (PA5 subset). Statistical analyses were conducted independently on the PA0, PA3, and PA5 subsets and on the whole database (global analysis) by using linear and nonlinear mixed-model procedures. The curves, either exponential, quadratic, or linear, describing the effects of PA on pasture intake, milk production, or grazing behavior of dairy cows are conceptually similar, whatever the EH. The equations describing these curves are, however, specific for each EH. Accordingly, from typical low to high PA, the increase in pasture intake (0.13 vs. 0.21 vs. 0.28kg/kg of PA), milk production (0.11 vs. 0.17 vs. 0.24kg/kg of PA), and milk solids production (0.008 vs. 0.010 vs. 0.013kg/kg of PA) per kilogram of increase in PA was lower for PA0 than for PA3, and for PA3 than for PA5. Grazing time increased from low to medium PA and did not vary from medium to high PA. Pasture intake rate seemed to increase from low to medium PA because of greater bite mass, whereas it increased from medium to high PA because of greater biting rate. The present meta-analysis demonstrated that the general relationship between PA and any dependent variable is quite strong and independent of EH. This suggests no specific relationship for some parts of the world or methodology approach, with a high portability of the global equations calculated here. These results are useful for improving grazing management and modeling on pasture-based dairy systems.},

	abstract = {Grazing management is a key factor in pasture-based dairy systems, which can be improved given advanced knowledge of the effects of pregrazing pasture mass (PM) on the performance of dairy cows. The aim of this study was to quantify the effects of PM on the pasture intake, milk production, milk composition, and grazing behavior of strip- or rotational-grazing dairy cows, based on a meta-analysis of published research papers. A database was created that included experiments in which the effects of PM on pasture intake and milk production of dairy cows were studied. Papers were selected only if at least 2 PM were compared under similar experimental conditions, particularly the same pasture allowance (SPA). The final database included 15 papers with 27 PM comparisons. For analytical purposes, the database was subdivided into 3 subsets that varied according to the estimation height at which pasture allowance was determined; that is, where PM were compared at the SPA above ground level (SPA(0) subset), above 2 to 3 cm (SPA(3) subset), and above 4 to 5 cm (SPA(5) subset). Statistical analyses were conducted on the entire database (global analysis) and within each subset using linear model procedures. An interaction between PM and estimation height was found for pasture intake and milk production in the global analysis. On the basis of the predictive equations, pasture intake increased by 1.58 kg of dry matter/d per tonne increase in PM when PM were compared at SPA(0), was not affected by PM when PM were compared at SPA(3), and decreased by 0.65 kg of dry matter/d per tonne increase in PM when PM were compared at SPA(5). This is consistent with the effect of PM on milk production, which was positive and negative (1.04 and -0.79 kg/t of PM, respectively) when PM were compared at SPA(0) and SPA(5), respectively. Grazing time was only slightly affected by PM, irrespective of estimation height, because the effect of PM on pasture intake was mainly dependent on the variation in pasture intake rate. Pasture intake rate increased with increasing PM at SPA(0) but decreased with increasing PM at SPA(5). This meta-analysis clearly demonstrates that the effects of PM on pasture intake, milk production, and behavior of strip-grazing dairy cows depend largely on the height at which the PM and pasture allowance are measured. These results have methodological implications for future grazing research because it can be recommended that PM be compared at similar levels of pasture availability (i.e., at the same pasture allowance above 2 to 3 cm) to avoid possible misinterpretations of results. They also reveal the benefits of improving grazing management and intake prediction through modeling in pasture-based dairy systems.},

Odds ratios (the relative probability of pregnancy between treated and control cows) were compared for each study and found to vary significantly among studies, ranging from 0 to 22\%. We showed by logistic regression analysis that response to GnRH treatment varied with cow type (beef or dairy), age (cow or heifer), estrus synchronization (synchronized or natural), pregnancy diagnosis (method and time) and effect of individual study. When all these variables were included only 6 of 14 publications could be analyzed, representing 2,541 instead of 10,945 cows. In this limited subgroup of data, a significant improvement in pregnancy rate was detected among treated cattle (odds ratio = 1.33; P{\textless}0.01).},

It was conducted in August 2007. Primary studies on causes of morbidity and mortality on smallholder dairy farms in the region were identified, examined and descriptive information extracted. Electronic (CAB Abstracts, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Web of Science) and non-electronic databases were used to identify and retrieve the primary studies. The retrieval process included all types of study designs with no restriction on the year of publication and language. Mastitis, tick-borne diseases (TBDs), tick infestation and diarrhoea were among the most commonly documented causes of morbidity. TBDs, diarrhoea and trypanosomiasis were among the most commonly documented causes of mortality; however, a substantial number of mortalities with undiagnosed causes were also reported. Factors ranked as most negatively associated with mastitis were residual calf suckling and increased water availability on the farm while use of common udder towel was the factor most positively associated with mastitis. Zero-grazing was ranked as the factor most negatively associated with TBDs while age was most positively associated. More intervention studies are recommended in the region to better identify animal health constraints and their associated risk factors.},

Treatment mean values were extracted from 68 peer-reviewed studies, including 306 feeding trials. The main criterion for inclusion of a study in the meta-analysis was that it reported, or permitted calculation of, energy efficiency (Eeff; energy in milk/digestible energy intake) and nitrogen efficiency (Neff; nitrogen in milk/digestible nitrogen intake) at the digestible level (digestible energy or digestible protein). The effect of nutritional and animal variables, including neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber (ADF), digestible energy, digestible protein, proportion of concentrate (PCO), dry matter intake, milk yield, days in milk, and body weight, on Eeff, Neff, and the Neff:Eeff ratio was analyzed using mixed models. The interstudy correlation between Eeff and Neff was 0.62, whereas the intrastudy correlation was 0.30. The higher interstudy correlation was partly due to milk yield and dry matter intake being present in both Eeff and Neff. We, therefore, also explored the Neff:Eeff ratio. Energy efficiency was negatively associated with ADF and PCO, whereas Neff was negatively associated with ADF and digestible energy. The Neff:Eeff ratio was affected by ADF and PCO only. In conclusion, the results indicate a possibility to maximize feed efficiency in terms of both energy and nitrogen at the same time. In other words, an improvement in Eeff would also mean an improvement in Neff. The current study also shows that these types of transverse data are not sufficient to study the effect of animal factors, such as days in milk, on feed efficiency. Longitudinal measurements per animal would probably be more appropriate.},

	abstract = {AIM: There are conflicting findings from observational studies regarding the nature of the association between hyperoxia and risk of mortality in patients admitted to intensive care following cardiac arrest. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates animal data investigating the effect of administration of high concentrations of oxygen following cardiac arrest on neurological outcome and the clinical applicability of this data. METHODS: A systematic search of Medline and Embase identified controlled animal studies modelling cardiac arrest with subsequent cardiopulmonary resuscitation that compared ventilation with 100\% oxygen to lower concentrations following return of spontaneous circulation. Eligible studies were included in a meta-analysis in which the inverse variance weighted differences were calculated for the standardised mean difference of the primary outcome measure, the neurological deficit score. RESULTS: Ten studies met the criteria for inclusion in the systematic review. In a meta-analysis of six studies, with 95 animals, treatment with 100\% oxygen resulted in a significantly worse neurological deficit score than oxygen administered at lower concentrations, with a standardised mean difference of -0.64 (95\% CI -1.06 to -0.22). In four of five studies, histological evidence of increased neuronal damage was present in animals that received 100\% oxygen therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The administration of 100\% oxygen therapy is associated with worse neurological outcome than lower oxygen concentrations in animal models of cardiac arrest. However, due to limitations in study design and poor generalisability of the animal models to the situation of post cardiac arrest resuscitation in humans, the clinical applicability of this data is uncertain.},

Research has typically focussed on the prevalence, concentration, and transmission of zoonoses from farm animals to humans, yet there are gaps in our understanding of these factors among animals in contact with the public who don't live on or visit farms. This study aims to quantify, through a systematic review and meta-analysis, the prevalence and concentration of Campylobacter carriage in household pets and petting zoo animals. Four databases were accessed for the systematic review (PubMed, CAB direct, ProQuest, and Web of Science) for papers published in English from 1992-2012, and studies were included if they examined the animal population of interest, assessed prevalence or concentration with fecal, hair coat, oral, or urine exposure routes (although only articles that examined fecal routes were found), and if the research was based in Canada, USA, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Studies were reviewed for qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis by two reviewers, compiled into a database, and relevant studies were used to create a weighted mean prevalence value. There were insufficient data to run a meta-analysis of concentration values, a noted study limitation. The mean prevalence of Campylobacter in petting zoo animals is 6.5\% based on 7 studies, and in household pets the mean is 24.7\% based on 34 studies. Our estimated concentration values were: 7.65x103cfu/g for petting zoo animals, and 2.9x105cfu/g for household pets. These results indicate that Campylobacter prevalence and concentration are lower in petting zoo animals compared with household pets and that both of these animal sources have a lower prevalence compared with farm animals that do not come into contact with the public. There is a lack of studies on Campylobacter in petting zoos and/or fair animals in Canada and abroad. Within this literature, knowledge gaps were identified, and include: a lack of concentration data reported in the literature for Campylobacter spp. in animal feces, a distinction between ill and diarrheic pets in the reported studies, noted differences in shedding and concentrations for various subtypes of Campylobacter, and consistent reporting between studies.},

We have conducted a systematic review of studies investigating suicidal behaviour and psychosocial problems in veterinary surgeons. METHODS: A systematic search of the international research literature was performed in May 2008. Data from 52 studies of non-fatal suicidal behaviour, mental health difficulties, stress and burnout, occupational difficulties, and psychological characteristics of veterinary surgeons were extracted by two independent reviewers and analysed. Studies were rated for quality and greater emphasis placed on findings from higher quality studies. RESULTS: The majority of studies were of stress and occupational difficulties experienced by veterinary surgeons. Occupational stressors included managerial aspects of the job, long working hours, heavy workload, poor work-life balance, difficult client relations, and performing euthanasia. Few studies investigated suicidal behaviour or mental health difficulties in the profession. Some studies suggested that young and female veterinarians are at greatest risk of negative outcomes such as suicidal thoughts, mental health difficulties, and job dissatisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: The review highlights the difficulties faced by veterinary surgeons that may contribute to poor mental wellbeing and suicidal behaviour. Future research might include further examination of the influence of euthanasia on attitudes towards suicide and more direct examination of the impact that occupational risk factors might have on suicidal behaviour. Suggestions about the review's implications for suicide prevention in this group are also made.},

Identification of the occupations at risk, and the factors that contribute to the increased risk of suicide in these groups is essential for the development of effective suicide prevention strategies. There is preliminary evidence to suggest that veterinary surgeons are a group at risk. AIMS: To conduct a systematic review of studies of rates and methods of suicide in the veterinary profession. METHODS: A systematic search of the international research literature was performed in May 2008. The data from the 19 studies of the prevalence of suicide in the veterinary profession were extracted by two independent reviewers and analysed. RESULTS: Between 0 and 43\% of veterinary surgeon deaths were due to suicide. In all but one of the 15 studies presenting risk of suicide in veterinary surgeons with a comparison population, an elevated risk was found. The better quality studies with the lowest risk of bias indicated that in the UK, the rate of suicide in the veterinary profession was at least three times the general population rate. Studies of the methods of suicide veterinary surgeons use suggest that self-poisoning and firearms are particularly common. CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be an elevated risk of suicide for veterinary surgeons in several countries. Access to means of suicide influences the methods used and may contribute to increased risk.},

Progress towards minimizing both veterinary and financial impact of the disease will be made with targeted disease control policies. To move towards targeted control, specific targets and detailed control strategies must be defined. One approach for identifying targets is to use mathematical and simulation models quantified with accurate and fine-scale data to design and evaluate alternative control policies. Nevertheless, published models of FMDV vary in modelling techniques and resolution of data incorporated. In order to determine which models and data sources contain enough detail to represent realistic control policy alternatives, we performed a systematic literature review of all FMDV dynamical models that use host data, disease data or both data types. For the purpose of evaluating modelling methodology, we classified models by control strategy represented, resolution of models and data, and location modelled. We found that modelling methodology has been well developed to the point where multiple methods are available to represent detailed and contact-specific transmission and targeted control. However, detailed host and disease data needed to quantify these models are only available from a few outbreaks. To address existing challenges in data collection, novel data sources should be considered and integrated into models of FMDV transmission and control. We suggest modelling multiple endemic areas to advance local control and global control and better understand FMDV transmission dynamics. With incorporation of additional data, models can assist with both the design of targeted control and identification of transmission drivers across geographic boundaries.},

Sixty-one research publications (published journal articles, published abstracts, and technical reports) were identified through a review of literature provided by the manufacturer and a search of published literature using 6 search engines. Thirty-six separate studies with 69 comparisons met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The fixed-effect meta-analysis showed substantial heterogeneity for milk yield, energy-corrected milk, 3.5\% fat-corrected milk, milk fat yield, and milk protein yield. Sub-group analysis of the data showed much less heterogeneity in peer-reviewed studies versus non-peer-reviewed abstracts and technical reports, and tended to show higher, but not significantly different, treatment effects. A random-effects meta-analysis showed estimated raw mean differences between treated and untreated cattle reported in peer-reviewed publications of 1.18 kg/d [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.55 to 1.81], 1.61 kg/d (95\% CI: 0.92 to 2.29), and 1.65 kg/d (95\% CI: 0.97 to 2.34) for milk yield, 3.5\% fat-corrected milk, and energy-corrected milk, respectively. Milk fat yield and milk protein yield for peer-reviewed studies showed an increase in the raw mean difference of 0.06 kg/d (95\% CI: 0.01 to 0.10) and 0.03 kg/d (95\% CI: 0.00 to 0.05), respectively. Estimated raw mean dry matter intake of the peer-reviewed studies during early lactation ({\textless}70 d in milk) and not-early lactation were 0.62 kg/d (95\% CI: 0.21 to 1.02) and a decrease of 0.78 kg/d (95\% CI: -1.36 to -0.21), respectively. These findings provide strong evidence that this commercially available yeast culture product provides significant improvement in several important milk production outcomes as evaluated in production settings typical for commercial dairies in North America. Utilizing meta-analytic methods to study the complete breadth of information relating to a specific treatment by studying multiple overcomes of all eligible studies can reduce the uncertainty often seen in small individual studies designed without sufficient power to detect differences in treatments.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to collate and review the peer and non-peer reviewed English language literature on the treatment and prevention of foot lameness in cattle published since January 2000. The study aimed to identify deficits in knowledge and areas of disparity between what is recommended in the field by veterinarians, foot trimmers and advisors and what has been substantiated experimentally. Peer reviewed literature containing original work was gathered by searching three databases. Papers were categorised and reviewed if they contained material on treatment or prevention. Non-peer reviewed clinical materials were collated from a range of sources. The materials were reviewed and categorised based on whether they recommended a range of possible treatment and prevention strategies. The peer reviewed data base contained 591 papers, of which 286 contained information on treatment or prevention. The vast majority of papers (258) concerned prevention; only a small number covered treatment (31) and of these only three contained information on the treatment of sole ulcers or white line disease. The number of intervention studies and trials was low; most papers on prevention were observational. Generally, lesion specific outcomes were not described making the findings of these papers difficult to use clinically. The non-peer reviewed material contained 46 sources; they varied significantly in regard to the treatments they advocated with some texts directly contradicting each other. Some aspects of prevention recommended in these sources seemed poorly supported by findings from the research literature. Well designed intervention studies are required to address these deficits.},

	abstract = {Human cadmium intake derives mainly from food sources, and cadmium can be present in high concentrations in some offal. A meta-analysis using random effects modeling was carried out to integrate the results of 21 controlled randomized trials in which sheep were fed diets with elevated cadmium levels and cadmium concentrations in their livers and kidneys were recorded after slaughter. Resulting predictions of cadmium accumulation in sheep are applicable to a broad set of exposure situations allowing the critical examination of cadmium in the human food chain. The product of the cadmium concentration in the feed and the duration of exposure to that feed were significant predictors of the cadmium concentration in livers and kidneys. The predominantly organic rather than inorganic form of cadmium in the feed further increased accumulation. Other variables (dry matter intake, the vehicle of the elevated cadmium in the diet, animal age, weight, and sex) were not significant. As a result, the prime measure to decrease the risk of cadmium from animal origin adversely affecting human health should be restricting the animals' cumulative cadmium intake. It is suggested that this might be achieved by preventing the livers and kidneys of older animals from entering the human food chain.},

Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, and checklist, relevant articles were identified and data were extracted and recorded. The review provided Leptospira seroprevalence data from 16 Caribbean islands (Barbados, Trinidad, Grenada, Puerto Rico, Saint Croix, St. Kitts and Nevis, Jamaica, Antigua, Carriacou, Dominica, Guadalupe, Martinique, Monserrat, St. Lucia, St. Maarten, and St. Vincent) in a variety of animal species. Reviewing the literature highlighted the limited amount of data available from limited number of islands. Many of the studies conducted have recorded seroprevalences based on variable and small samples sizes. Besides, serovar panels used for MAT were not consistent between studies. The review indicates that the Leptospira exposure in a given geographic location may change with time and climatic and environmental conditions, and highlights the need to conduct continual surveillance in tropical countries where the climate supports the survival of Leptospira in the environment. Specific attention must be given to standardization of MAT panels and protocols and providing training across laboratories involved in testing. Further, animal and environment testing to isolate and identify circulating Leptospira spp. in a geographic region must actively be pursued. This knowledge is important to implement geographically specific control programs, as risk factors of Leptospira transmission is favoured by various factors such as change in climatic conditions, urbanization, encroachment of wildlife inhabitation, import/export of animals, increase in adventure travel, and water related recreational activities.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of animal sentience is fundamental to many disciplines and imperative to the animal welfare movement. In this review, we examined what is being explored and discussed, regarding animal sentience, within the scientific literature. Rather than attempting to extract meaning from the many complex and abstract definitions of animal sentience, we searched over two decades of scientific literature using a peer-reviewed list of 174 keywords. The list consisted of human emotions, terminology associated with animal sentience, and traits often thought to be indicative of subjective states. We discovered that very little was actually being explored, and instead there was already much agreement about what animals can feel. Why then is there so much scepticism surrounding the science of animal sentience? Sentience refers to the subjective states of animals, and so is often thought to be impossible to measure objectively. However, when we consider that much of the research found to accept and utilise animal sentience is performed for the development of human drugs and treatment, it appears that measuring sentience is, after all, not quite as impossible as was previously thought. In this paper, we explored what has been published on animal sentience in the scientific literature and where the gaps in research lie. We drew conclusions on the implications for animal welfare science and argued for the importance of addressing these gaps in our knowledge. We found that there is a need for more research on positive emotional states in animals, and that there is still much to learn about taxa such as invertebrates. Such information will not only be useful in supporting and initiating legislative amendments but will help to increase understanding, and potentially positive actions and attitudes towards animals.},

Social relationships are fundamental to child and adolescent development; yet studies have been limited to children's relationships with other humans. This paper provides an evidence review for the potential associations between pet ownership and emotional; behavioural; cognitive; educational and social developmental outcomes. As the field is in the early stages; a broad set of inclusion criteria was applied. A systematic search of databases and grey literature sources found twenty-two studies meeting selection criteria. The review found evidence for an association between pet ownership and a wide range of emotional health benefits from childhood pet ownership; particularly for self-esteem and loneliness. The findings regarding childhood anxiety and depression were inconclusive. Studies also showed evidence of an association between pet ownership and educational and cognitive benefits; for example, in perspective-taking abilities and intellectual development. Evidence on behavioural development was unclear due to a lack of high quality research. Studies on pet ownership and social development provided evidence for an association with increased social competence; social networks; social interaction and social play behaviour. Overall, pet ownership and the significance of children's bonds with companion animals have been underexplored; there is a shortage of high quality and longitudinal studies in all outcomes. Prospective studies that control for a wide range of confounders are required.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a need for sensitive and specific rapid diagnostic tests (RDT) for canine visceral leishmaniasis. The aims of this study were to evaluate the diagnostic performance of immunochromatographic dipstick RDTs using rK39 antigen for canine visceral leishmaniasis by (i) investigating the sensitivity of RDTs to detect infection, disease and infectiousness in a longitudinal cohort study of natural infection in Brazil, and (ii) using meta-analysis to estimate the sensitivity and specificity of RDTs from published studies. METHODOLOGY: We used a rK39 RDT (Kalazar Detect Canine Rapid Test; Inbios) to test sera collected from 54 sentinel dogs exposed to natural infection in an endemic area of Brazil. Dogs were sampled bimonthly for up to 27 months, and rK39 results compared to those of crude antigen ELISA, PCR, clinical status and infectiousness to sandflies. We then searched MEDLINE and Web of Knowledge (1993-2011) for original studies evaluating the performance of rK39 RDTs in dogs. Meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity was performed using bivariate mixed effects models. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The sensitivity of the rK39 RDT in Brazil to detect infection, disease and infectiousness was 46\%, 77\% and 78\% respectively. Sensitivity increased with time since infection, antibody titre, parasite load, clinical score and infectiousness. Sixteen studies met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. The combined sensitivity of rK39 RDTs was 86.7\% (95\% CI: 76.9-92.8\%) to detect clinical disease and 59.3\% (37.9-77.6\%) to detect infection. Combined specificity was 98.7\% (89.5-99.9\%). Both sensitivity and specificity varied considerably between studies. CONCLUSION: The diagnostic performance of rK39 RDTs is reasonable for confirmation of infection in suspected clinical cases, but the sensitivity to detect infected dogs is too low for large-scale epidemiological studies and operational control programmes.},

	abstract = {The objectives of this study were to critically review randomized controlled trials, and quantify, using meta-analysis and meta-regression, the effects of supplementation with fats on milk production and components by dairy cows. We reviewed 59 papers, of which 38 (containing 86 comparisons) met eligibility criteria. Five groups of fats were evaluated: tallows, calcium salts of palm fat (Megalac, Church and Dwight Co. Inc., Princeton, NJ), oilseeds, prilled fat, and other calcium salts. Milk production responses to fats were significant, and the estimated mean difference was 1.05 kg/cow per day, but results were heterogeneous. Milk yield increased with increased difference in dry matter intake (DMI) between treatment and control groups, decreased with predicted metabolizable energy (ME) balance between these groups, and decreased with increased difference in soluble protein percentage of the diet between groups. Decreases in DMI were significant for Megalac, oilseeds, and other Ca salts, and approached significance for tallow. Feeding fat for a longer period increased DMI, as did greater differences in the amount of soluble protein percentage of the diet between control and treatment diets. Tallow, oilseeds, and other Ca salts reduced, whereas Megalac increased, milk fat percentage. Milk fat percentage effects were heterogeneous for fat source. Differences between treatment and control groups in duodenal concentrations of C18:2 and C 18:0 fatty acids and Mg percentage reduced the milk fat percentage standardized mean difference. Milk fat yield responses to fat treatments were very variable. The other Ca salts substantially decrease, and the Megalac and oilseeds increased, fat yield. Fat yield increased with increased DMI difference between groups and was lower with an increased estimated ME balance between treatment and control groups, indicating increased partitioning of fat to body tissue reserves. Feeding fats decreased milk protein percentage, but results were heterogeneous. An increased number of milkings increased the milk protein percentage, whereas the difference between the treatment and control groups in duodenal concentrations of 18:2 fatty acids and dietary Mg concentration reduced the milk protein percentage. None of the fat treatments influenced milk protein production. The range of responses to different fats fed approached or exceeded 5 standard deviations from the mean and differed in point direction for all variables studied, indicating the varied and profound biological effects of fats. Responses to fat feeding were highly heterogeneous for all variables studied and heterogeneity was present within responses to individual fat groups. The lower DMI combined with higher milk and milk fat production showed that fats could improve the efficiency of milk production. More studies are required to more completely characterize sources of variation in responses to fats.},

The literature search identified 18 English-language publications on the use of Teatseal in dairy cattle. A total of 12 studies with 17 subtrials or comparisons including 13 positive control subtrials (internal teat sealant and ADCT vs. ADCT) and 4 negative control subtrials (internal teat sealant vs. untreated) examining IMI were included in the analysis. Internal teat sealants, alone or in the presence of ADCT, reduced the risk of acquiring new IMI after calving by 25\% [risk ratio (RR)=0.75; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.67 to 0.83]. Internal teat sealants reduced the risk of IMI by 73\% compared with untreated cows (RR=0.27; 95\% CI: 0.13 to 0.55). The results of both meta-analyses of IMI, with positive and negative controls, were heterogeneous [I(2) (a statistic that describes the proportion of total variation in study effect estimates that is due to heterogeneity)=65.4 and 92.1\%]. No farm or cow factors studied significantly contributed to the heterogeneity of the results. A total of 16 studies (21 subtrials), including 14 positive control subtrials and 7 negative control subtrials, examining clinical mastitis were included in the analysis. Internal teat sealants alone and in the presence of ADCT reduced the risk of clinical mastitis after calving in lactating cows by 29\% (RR=0.71; 95\% CI: 0.62 to 0.82), and 48\% (RR=0.52; 95\% CI: 0.37 to 0.75), respectively. The results of the meta-analysis on clinical mastitis with positive controls were homogeneous (I(2)=33.6\%), whereas the results of studies with negative controls were heterogeneous (I(2)=60.4\%). No farm or cow factors studied that had sufficient data to evaluate significantly contributed to the heterogeneity of the results. The estimated linear score (LS) of milk SCC after calving in published studies (n=3) and for studies that provided raw data (n=2), was significantly lower for cattle treated with internal teat sealants and ADCT in 3 studies than for cattle treated with internal teat sealants only. The estimated LS of pooled raw data of 3 studies from 32 herds showed that the LS of cows treated with internal teat sealant and ADCT was not significantly different than those treated with ADCT only. This study found that the application of internal teat sealants in the presence of ADCT or the use of internal teat sealants alone at dry off significantly reduced the incidence of IMI and clinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows compared with respective control groups. Further studies are needed to investigate the effect of internal teat sealants on postpartum milk SCC in lactating dairy cows.},

This meta-analysis examined 71 treatment and control comparisons extracted from 53 research papers. Programs evaluated included Ovsynch, natural breeding, single, double, or triple prostaglandin injections, Select Synch, Heat Synch, and modified Ovsynch. Pregnancy rates for Ovsynch programs did not differ significantly from those with natural breeding programs [predicted Bayesian relative risk (RR) = 1.04, 95\% Bayesian credible interval = 0.36 to 3.23]. Results of Ovsynch vs. PGF(2alpha) programs showed that the risk of conception (predicted Bayesian RR = 0.89, 95\% Bayesian credible interval = 0.31 to 2.64), and pregnancy rates predicted Bayesian RR = 1.11, 95\% Bayesian credible interval = 0.61 to 2.13) did not differ significantly between the Ovsynch group and cows in the PGF(2alpha) group. Comparisons between Ovsynch and Select Synch demonstrated that the risk of conception (predicted Bayesian RR = 0.94, 95\% Bayesian credible interval = 0.52 to 1.59), and pregnancy rates (predicted Bayesian RR = 1.08, 95\% Bayesian credible interval = 0.38 to 3.09) did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. Examination of Ovsynch vs. modified Ovsynch programs showed that the risk of pregnancy in cows synchronized with modified Ovsynch was similar to those treated with Ovsynch (predicted Bayesian RR = 0.89, 95\% Bayesian credible interval = 0.71 to 1.12).Meta-analyses identified that the conception and pregnancy rates obtained with the prostaglandin, Select Synch, and modified Ovsynch (including presynch and CoSynch) programs were comparable with the Ovsynch program. Modifications to the Ovsynch program such as presynchronization and timed artificial insemination at the time of second GnRH injection (CoSynch) may be an alternative for reproductive management of dairy herds where detection of estrus is less than optimal. The findings of this study demonstrate that the Ovsynch program could benefit dairy operations because it allows for timed artificial insemination of lactating cows without detection of estrus. There was, however, little or no significant improvement in pregnancy rates using Ovsynch over other programs and the costs of labor and hormone administration should be considered when selecting this form of reproductive technology for routine use.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment programmes that included controlled internal drug-releasing (CIDR) devices containing progesterone (P4) in improving synchrony of oestrus, and conception and pregnancy rates in cycling, anoestrous and inseminated dairy cows, using meta-analysis. To describe the difference in response between cycling and anoestrous cows to CIDR-based synchrony programmes. METHODS: Scientific papers written in the English language between 1989 and 2002 that investigated the effects of treatment programmes including CIDR devices on reproductive performance in dairy heifers or lactating dairy cows were identified using a computerised literature search. The criteria for inclusion incorporated evidence that treatment allocation was completely randomised; the population studied was lactating dairy cows; and that data were available on submission, conception and pregnancy rates and their associated measures of variability. Reproductive outcomes from 25 synchrony trials (total n=11,058 cows) were analysed. Summary measures of the effect of treatment on reproductive outcome were assessed using fixed- and random-effects Bayesian meta-analysis models. RESULTS: Treatment programmes including a CIDR device increased the risk of submission in cycling cows (predicted Bayesian RR=2.86, 95\% credible interval=1.46-5.67). Compared with controls, synchrony programmes including CIDR devices in cycling dairy cows had no effect on the risk of conception to first service post-treatment (predicted Bayesian RR=1.00, 95\% credible interval=0.80-1.24). Compared with controls, synchrony programmes including CIDR devices had no effect on the risk of pregnancy throughout the mating period (predicted Bayesian RR=1.02, 95\% credible interval=0.89-1.17). In anoestrous cows, CIDR treatment had no effect on the risk of conception to first service post-treatment and no effect on the risk of pregnancy throughout the mating period, compared with anoestrous, untreated controls (predicted Bayesian RR=0.91 and 0.97, respectively; 95\% credible interval=0.68-1.26 and 0.59-1.60, respectively). CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis showed that synchrony programmes using CIDR devices combined with other hormones reliably enhanced submission rates in lactating dairy cows. The relatively small number of trials with data suitable for analysis and the heterogeneity of results at the individual trial level limited our ability to confirm either a beneficial or deleterious effect of treatment on conception or pregnancy rates. Further randomised, controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of this form of reproductive therapy in commercial dairy farms are needed.},

Twenty research papers and reports on the effects of OTM were considered in this meta-analysis. Criteria for inclusion in the study were information on the form of OTM, an adequate description of randomization, production and reproduction data, and associated measures of variance (SE or SD) and P-values. The OTM increased milk production by 0.93 kg [95\% confidence interval (CI)=0.61 to 1.25], milk fat by 0.04 kg (95\% CI=0.02 to 0.05), and milk protein by 0.03 kg (95\% CI=0.02 to 0.04) per day. Milk SCC was not different in cows supplemented with OTM. All production outcomes except milk solids (yield) and milk SCC were heterogeneous. Meta-regression analysis showed that feeding before calving, feeding for a full lactation after calving, and the use of other supplements increased responses over feeding after calving only, feeding for part of lactation, or not using other supplements, respectively. Supplementation of cows with OTM reduced days open (weighted mean difference=13.5 d) and number of services per conception (weighted mean difference=0.27) in lactating dairy cows. The risk of pregnancy on d 150 of lactation was greater in cows fed OTM (risk ratio=1.07), but OTM had no significant effect on the interval from calving to first service and 21-d pregnancy rate. There was no evidence of heterogeneity for any of the reproductive outcomes evaluated. The results of this meta-analysis showed that organic trace mineral supplementation could improve production and reproduction in lactating dairy cows.},

After an acute attack, active surveillance of wild or domestic animal populations could help identify many ongoing exposure risks. If certain bioterrorism agents found their way into animal populations, they could spread widely through animal-to-animal transmission and prove difficult to control. The public health infrastructure must look beyond passive surveillance of acute animal disease events to build capacity for active surveillance and intervention efforts to detect and control ongoing outbreaks of disease in domestic and wild animal populations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The goal of this systematic review was to identify evidence that animals could serve as sentinels of an attack with a chemical terrorism agent. METHODS: The biomedical literature was systematically searched for evidence that wild or domestic animals exposed to certain chemical weapons of terrorism had either greater susceptibility, shorter latency period, or increased exposure risk versus humans. Additionally, we searched for documented reports of such animals historically serving as sentinels for chemical warfare agents. RESULTS: For a small number of agents, there was limited evidence that domestic and/or wild animals could provide sentinel information to humans following an airborne attack with chemical agents, usually related to increased potential for environmental exposure. Some of this evidence was based on anecdotal case reports, and in many cases high quality chemical terrorism agent evidence regarding comparative susceptibility, exposure, and latency between humans and sentinel animal species was not found. CONCLUSION: Currently, there is insufficient evidence for routine use of animals as sentinels for airborne chemical warfare agents. At the same time, Poison Center surveillance systems should include animal calls, and greater communication between veterinarians and physicians could help with preparedness for a chemical terrorism attack. Further analysis of comparative chemical warfare agent toxicity between sentinel animal species and humans is needed.},

All cross-sectional studies sampled subjects on the basis of exposure, using a reference population for the selection of controls. Studies of wild animal populations may hold unique advantages for toxicant hazard identification, yet the current range of study designs appeared restricted. Increased use of study approaches such as sampling based on outcome, intra-population comparisons, as well as cohort and case-control designs may improve hazard identification and priority setting for confirmatory toxicological and human studies of effects seen in wildlife.},

	abstract = {Dietary proteins play an important role in reproduction, and increased dietary crude proteins, increased degradability of dietary proteins, and elevated blood or milk urea have been associated with decreased conception and pregnancy in many studies. The aim of this work was to provide a meta-analysis on the relationship between high milk or blood urea and pregnancy or conception, with a focus on defining the appropriate urea threshold associated with this issue. The meta-analysis included 61 different models from 21 papers. The thresholds of urea tested in the various models were built by steps of 1 mM urea. This constructed variable reduced heterogeneity by 61\% in the meta-regression. The meta-analysis showed 43\% lower odds of pregnancy or conception (odds ratio = 0.57; 95\% confidence interval = 0.45-0.73) in cases where urea was {\textgreater}/=7.0 mM in the blood (plasma urea nitrogen = 19.3 mg/dL) or where urea was {\textgreater}/=420 mg/L in the milk compared with where urea values were lower. This threshold is the most suitable with regard to pregnancy or conception success, even if a threshold of 6.5 mM cannot be excluded with certainty. The results also highlighted the possibility of a stronger association between high urea concentrations and pregnancy or conception when high nitrogen exposure occurs before artificial insemination compared with after artificial insemination, but this possibility needs to be further studied. Whether the present results also apply to extensively pasture-based countries remains to be determined.},

	abstract = {Many studies have shown that subclinical ketosis (SCK) is associated with an increased risk of developing various diseases, reproductive disorders, and changes in milk production. The present work aims at producing an overview between this disorder and theses outcomes. A meta-analysis of the literature, including 131 different models from 23 papers, or a review when the literature was scarce was conducted. For each outcome, the odds ratio (OR), relative risk, or hazard ratio was presented for various moderators to reduce heterogeneity among the studies. The raw change in milk production associated with SCK was estimated and adjusted, taking into consideration the outcomes known to interact with milk production during the peripartum period. The results showed that 2 main categories of moderators had a significant effect on the adjusted risk. First, the adjustment made by defining SCK as (1) beta-hydroxybutyrate concentration {\textgreater}1.4 mM, (2) nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration {\textgreater}0.4 mM prepartum, or (3) NEFA concentration {\textgreater}1.0 mM postpartum corrected the underestimated risk (despite low significance). This is because several trials reported the relevant risks using lower thresholds for the beta-hydroxybutyrate or NEFA values. Using a low threshold leads to lower risk of disease compared with using a high threshold. Second, the correction produced using the polyfactorial terms corrected the overestimation of risk because many trials reported only univariable models. The relative risk or OR (95\% confidence interval) related to abomasal displacement, clinical ketosis, early culling and death, metritis, placental retention, clinical mastitis, lameness, and a doubling of the SCC in cases with SCK were 3.33 (2.60-4.25), 5.38 (3.27-8.83), 1.92 (1.60-2.30), 1.75 (1.54-2.01), 1.52 (1.20-1.93), 1.61 (1.24-2.09), 2.01(1.64-2.44), and 1.42 (1.26-1.60), respectively. The precision level of the estimate depended on the outcome. The direct mean +/- standard deviation of the 305-d milk losses associated with SCK were 251 +/- 73 kg after adjusting for abomasal displacement, clinical ketosis, metritis, and placental retention. The OR (95\% confidence interval) for first service calving risk in cases of SCK was 0.67 (0.53-0.83). The calving-to-first-service interval was 8 d longer and the calving-to-conception interval was 16 to 22 d longer in cows with SCK. The relationships among the different reproductive indicators were quantified in only 1 or 2 trials. The present work highlights the need to conduct further studies on the associations between SCK and the risks of diseases, changes in milk production, and reproductive parameters.},

Our results show the scarcity of accurate estimates of the impact of specific periparturient management practices on within-herd JD prevalence, which could, in part, be explained by challenges associated with the chronic nature of JD. Management practices aiming to limit the faecal-oral transmission route of Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) were found to be most effective at reducing within-herd prevalence of JD. Practices aiming to limit MAP transmission via colostrum and milk were found to be less effective. Losses foregone for a hypothetical herd of 200 milking cows were considerable; based on the assumptions, it is reasonable to expect between pound7000 and pound11,000 of losses foregone when management practices are implemented as a package of measures. The findings of this study are envisaged to enable farmers and veterinarians to make more informed decisions on changes to periparturient management to control JD.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii is a cosmopolitan zoonotic intracellular coccidian of the phylum Apicomplexa infecting warm-blooded animals and human beings. This protozoan causes a significant public health problem in humans and imposes considerable economic losses and damages to husbandry industries. The final host, cats, accounts for all of these significant burdens. Hence the present study was designed to analyse and review the overall prevalence rate of T. gondii infection in cats in Iran for the first time. In the present study data collection (published and unpublished papers, abstracts of proceedings of national parasitology congresses and dissertations) was systematically undertaken on electronic databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, Ebsco, Science Direct, Scopus, Magiran, Irandoc, IranMedex and Scientific Information Database. A total of 21 studies from 1975 to 2013 reporting prevalence of Toxoplasma infection in cats from different areas in Iran met the eligibility criteria. The pooled proportion of toxoplasmosis using the random-effect model amongst cats was estimated at 33.6\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 22.05-46.41). The prevalence rate of cat toxoplasmosis in various regions of Iran ranged from 1.2\% to 89.2\%. Firstly, this study establishes a crude prevalence rate of T. gondii infection in cats. Secondly, it discusses the role of significant risk factors including sex, age and being either household or stray cats, in the epidemiology of the disease. Furthermore, the current study determines gaps and drawbacks in the prior studies that are useful to keep in mind to assist in designing more accurate investigations in future.},

Thirty-one articles were found and 18 followed the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Research suggests that AAT/A is effective for different patient profiles, particularly children. Interaction with dogs has been found to increase positive behaviors, such as sensitivity and focus, in children with social disabilities. Decreased levels of pain have also been reported among child patients as a result of AAT/A. More research should be done in the area of children living with chronic diseases that require strict adherence to treatment, such as HIV, and on AAT/A's prospective use as an educational tool to teach children about the importance of self-care for their medical conditions.},

	abstract = {Neospora caninum is regarded as one of the most important infectious causes of abortions in cattle worldwide, yet the global economic impact of the infection has not been established. A systematic review of the economic impact of N. caninum infections/abortions was conducted, searching PubMed with the terms 'cattle' and 'Neospora'. This yielded 769 publications and the abstracts were screened for economically relevant information (e.g. abortion prevalence and risk, serological prevalence). Further analysis was restricted to countries with at least five relevant publications. In total, 99 studies (12.9\%) from 10 countries contained data from the beef industry (25 papers (25.3\%)) and 72 papers (72.8\%) from the dairy industry (with the remaining two papers (2.0\%) describing general abortion statistics). The total annual cost of N. caninum infections/abortions was estimated to range from a median US \$1.1 million in the New Zealand beef industry to an estimated median total of US \$546.3 million impact per annum in the US dairy population. The estimate for the total median N. caninum-related losses exceeded US \$1.298 billion per annum, ranging as high as US \$2.380 billion. Nearly two-thirds of the losses were incurred by the dairy industry (US \$842.9 million). Annual losses on individual dairy farms were estimated to reach a median of US \$1,600.00, while on beef farms these costs amounted to just US \$150.00. Pregnant cows and heifers were estimated to incur, on average, a loss due to N. caninum of less than US \$20.00 for dairy and less than US \$5.00 for beef. These loss estimates, however, rose to approximately US \$110.00 and US \$40.00, respectively, for N. caninum-infected pregnant dairy and beef cows. This estimate of global losses due to N. caninum, with the identification of clear target markets (countries, as well as cattle industries), should provide an incentive to develop treatment options and/or vaccines.},

	abstract = {High ambient temperature (T) is one of the most important climatic factors influencing pig performance. Increased T occurs sporadically during summer heat waves in temperate climates and year round in tropical climates. Results of published experiments assessing the effects of high T on pig performance are surprisingly variable. Thus, a meta-analysis was performed to aggregate our knowledge and attempt to explain differences in the results across studies on the effect of increased T on ADFI and ADG in growing-finishing pigs. Data for ADFI and ADG were extracted from 86 and 80 trials, respectively, from articles published in scientific journals indexed in PubMed, Science Direct, and from proceedings of scientific meetings through November 2009. Data on ADFI and ADG were analyzed using a linear mixed model that included the linear and the quadratic effects of T and BW, and their interactions as continuous, fixed effects variables, and the trial as a random effect factor (i.e., block). In addition, the effects of housing type (2 levels: individual and group housing) and the year of publication (3 levels: 1970 to 1989, 1990 to 1999, and 2000 to 2009) on the intercept and the linear regression term for T (i.e., the slope) were also tested. Results showed that high T had a curvilinear effect on ADFI and ADG and that this effect was more pronounced in heavier pigs. Across T, ADFI was less when pigs were group-housed. The intercept and the regression coefficient (slope) for T were significantly affected by the year of publication. The effect of increased T was greater in more contemporary works, suggesting that modern genotypes could be more sensitive to heat stress than older genotypes of lesser growth potential. In conclusion, pig performance decreases at an accelerating rate as T is increased. The large between-study variability on the effects of high T on pig performance is partially explained by differences in pig BW and to a lesser extent by the year the study was published.},

Among papers, there was no standardised procedure in to inoculate the solutions. Nevertheless, in general, in ovo feeding of carbohydrates decreases the hatch rate, improves the hatch weight, but it does not seem to influence the post-hatch performance of broilers. The inoculation of 75 mg of glucose in the albumen seems to bring better results. Further studies are needed to improve the technical methodology of in ovo injections for commercial use.},

The current literature contains several studies detailing analyses with conflicting results as to whether intramammary infection (IMI) with the minor pathogens decreases, increases, or has no effect on the risk of a quarter acquiring a new intramammary infection (NIMI) with a major pathogen. To investigate the available scientific evidence regarding the effect of IMI with minor pathogens on the acquisition of NIMI with major pathogens, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. The total extant English- and French-language literature in electronic databases was searched and all publications cited by relevant papers were investigated. Results from 68 studies were extracted from 38 relevant papers. Random-effects models were used to investigate the effects of CNS and C. bovis on acquisition of new IMI with any of the major pathogens, as well as individually for the minor pathogens and Staph. aureus. Significant heterogeneity among studies exists, some of which could be accounted for by using meta-regression. Overall, observational studies showed no effect, whereas challenge studies showed strong and significant protective effects, specifically when major pathogens were introduced into the mammary gland via methods bypassing the teat end. Underlying risk can account for several unmeasured factors, and studies with higher underlying risk found more protective effects of minor pathogens. Larger doses of challenge organisms reduced the protective effect of minor pathogens, and studies with more stringent diagnostic criteria for pathogen IMI identified less protection. Smaller studies (those utilizing fewer than 40 cows) also showed a greater protective effect than larger studies.},

A linear mixed model was applied to analyse factors that influence the level of monetary direct losses due to BVDV infection. The 44 studies included in this review covered 15 countries and assessed direct monetary losses due to BVDV incurred over the past 30 years. Direct losses between and within countries were largely heterogeneous with respect to the monetary level and types of direct losses, ranging from 0.50 to 687.80 US dollars (USD) per animal.1 Average direct losses per naive dairy cow were USD24.85 higher than per beef cow. Country-specific assessments of direct losses due to BVDV were provided in 38/44 (86.4\%) studies. Mortality, morbidity, premature culling, stillbirths, abortion, reinfection, country and study type had a significant influence on the monetary level of direct losses (r2 = 0.69).

	abstract = {The study was aimed at summarising the literature that compares the incidence levels of spontaneously occurring intramammary infections (IMI) during the dry period, without versus with antibiotic dry cow treatment (DCT). A meta-analytic relative risk (RR) calculation was implemented when a priori relevant. Two main categories of comparison were used in the 36 selected papers. In the first category, the udder quarters were randomly allocated (at quarter or cow level) to an untreated or a treated group. Quarter incidence averaged 12.8\% (weighted mean) in untreated quarters, and depending on the DCT used, from 6.6 to 8.0\% in treated quarters. The meta-analytic RR of new IMI for untreated versus treated quarters varied from 1.54 to 1.94, depending on the DCT used. DCT was mainly found effective against IMI due to streptococci and coagulase-positive staphylococci. Based on only a few papers, the application of an internal teat sealer was associated to a quite similar (or possibly better) protection against IMI than DCT, but only in a subpopulation of particular (selected) cows. In the second category of studies, a selective dry cow or quarter antibiotic-treatment (selective DCT or DQT), according to cow or quarter selection criteria, was compared to blanket DCT. The meta-analytic RR of new IMI was 1.71 for selective DCT versus blanket DCT. Selective DQT seemed to be more at risk than selective DCT, but consisted of treating a much lower proportion of quarters. The summary-results provided by our meta-analysis should only be used with caution, due to possibly low external validity. More research seems to be relevant on the risk factors of new IMI during the dry period to make the outcomes of omission of DCT in selected cows more predictable under field conditions.},

	abstract = {The sex of a bird can, in principle, affect exposure and accumulation of mercury. One conventional explanation for sex differences in mercury burden suggests female birds should have lower concentrations than conspecific males, because breeding females can depurate methylmercury to their eggs. However, sex differences in body burden of mercury among birds are not consistent. We used meta-analysis to synthesize 123 male-female comparisons of mercury burden from 50 studies. For breeding birds, males had higher concentrations of mercury than did females, supporting egg depuration as a mechanism. However, the percentage of female body mass represented by a clutch did not significantly predict the magnitude of the sex difference in mercury contamination, as predicted. Furthermore, whether species were semialtrical or altrical versus semiprecocial or precocial also did not explain sex differences in mercury burden. Foraging guild of a species did explain near significant variation in sex differences in mercury burden where piscivores and invertivores showed significant sex differences, but sex differences were not detected for carnivores, herbivores, insectivores, and omnivores. The magnitude and direction of sexual size dimorphism did not explain variation in sex differences in mercury burden among breeding birds. We reveal targeted research directions on mechanisms for sex differences in mercury and confirm that sex is important to consider for environmental risk assessments based on breeding birds.},

	abstract = {Evidence is increasing of positive effects of feeding fats during transition on fertility and the adaptation to lactation. This study used meta-analytic methods to explore the effects of including fats in the transition diet on the risk of pregnancy to service (proportion pregnant) and calving to pregnancy interval. Meta-analysis was used to integrate smaller studies and increase the statistical power over that of any single study and explore new hypotheses. We explored the effect of fats and diet composition on fertility using meta-regression methods. Relatively few highly controlled studies are available providing detailed descriptions of the diets used that examined interactions between fat nutrition and reproductive outcomes. Only 17 studies containing 26 comparisons were suitable for inclusion in statistical evaluations. Reproductive variables evaluated were risk of pregnancy (proportion pregnant), primarily to first service, and calving to pregnancy interval. Production variables examined were milk yield, milk composition, and body weight. The sources of heterogeneity in these studies were also explored. A 27\% overall increase in pregnancy to service was observed (relative risk=1.27; 95\% confidence interval Knapp Hartung 1.09 to 1.45), and results were relatively consistent (I(2)=19.9\%). A strong indication of a reduction in calving to pregnancy interval was also identified, which was consistent across studies (I(2)=0.0\%), supporting a conclusion that, overall, the inclusion of fats does improve fertility. Further exploration of the factors contributing to proportion pregnant using bivariate meta-regression identified variables that reflected changes in diet composition or animal response resulting from inclusion of the fat interventions in the experimental diets fed. Increased fermentable neutral detergent fiber and soluble fiber intakes increased the proportion pregnant, whereas increased milk yield of the treatment group decreased this measure. Unexpectedly, the estimated energy costs of urea production also had a positive association with proportion pregnant. The limited number of suitable studies for the analysis highlights the need for more work to improve understanding of the critical nutritional factors affecting fertility. These factors include specific fatty acids in dietary interventions that contribute to increasing fertility of cows in dairy production systems.},

	abstract = {SUMMARY In this globalized world, the spread of new, exotic and re-emerging diseases has become one of the most important threats to animal production and public health. This systematic review analyses conventional and novel early detection methods applied to surveillance. In all, 125 scientific documents were considered for this study. Exotic (n = 49) and re-emerging (n = 27) diseases constituted the most frequently represented health threats. In addition, the majority of studies were related to zoonoses (n = 66). The approaches found in the review could be divided in surveillance modalities, both active (n = 23) and passive (n = 5); and tools and methodologies that support surveillance activities (n = 57). Combinations of surveillance modalities and tools (n = 40) were also found. Risk-based approaches were very common (n = 60), especially in the papers describing tools and methodologies (n = 50). The main applications, benefits and limitations of each approach were extracted from the papers. This information will be very useful for informing the development of tools to facilitate the design of cost-effective surveillance strategies. Thus, the current literature review provides key information about the advantages, disadvantages, limitations and potential application of methodologies for the early detection of new, exotic and re-emerging diseases.},

Is there a scope for more effective VL control in the Americas where transmission is zoonotic? We reviewed the evidence on VL control strategies in Latin America-diagnosis, treatment, veterinary interventions, vector control-with respect to entomological and clinical outcomes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We searched the electronic databases of MEDLINE, LILACS, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, from 1960 to November 2008 and references of selected articles. Intervention trials as well as observational studies that evaluated control strategies of VL in the Americas were included. While the use of rapid diagnostic tests for VL diagnosis seems well established, there is a striking lack of evidence from clinical trials for drug therapy and few well designed intervention studies for control of vectors or canine reservoirs. CONCLUSION: Elimination of zoonotic VL in the Americas does not seem a realistic goal at this point given the lack of political commitment, gaps in scientific knowledge, and the weakness of case management and surveillance systems. Research priorities and current strategies should be reviewed with the aim of achieving better VL control.},

	issn = {1746-6148},
	doi = {10.1186/s12917-016-0661-4},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinical audit is a quality improvement process with the goal of continuously improving quality of patient care as assessed by explicit criteria. In human medicine clinical audit has become an integral and required component of the standard of care. In contrast, in veterinary medicine there appear to have been a limited number of clinical audits published, indicating that while clinical audit is recognised, its adoption in veterinary medicine is still in its infancy. A systematic review was designed to report and evaluate the veterinary literature on clinical audit in companion animal species (dog, cat, horse). A systematic search of English and French articles using Proquest Dissertations and Theses database (February 6, 2014), CAB Abstracts (March 21, 2014 and April 4, 2014), Scopus (March 21, 2014), Web of Science Citation index (March 21, 2014) and OVID Medline (March 21, 2014) was performed. Included articles were those either discussing clinical audit (such as review articles and editorials) or reporting parts of, or complete, audit cycles. RESULTS: The majority of articles describing clinical audit were reviews. From 89 articles identified, twenty-one articles were included and available for review. Twelve articles were reviews of clinical audit in veterinary medicine, five articles included at least one veterinary clinical audit, one thesis was identified, one report was of a veterinary clinical audit website and two articles reported incomplete clinical audits. There was no indication of an increase in the number of published clinical audits since the first report in 1998. However, there was evidence of article misclassification, with studies fulfilling the criteria of clinical audit not appropriately recognised. Quality of study design and reporting of findings varied considerably, with information missing on key components, including duration of study, changes in practice implemented between audits, development of explicit criteria and appropriate statistical analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence suggests the application and reporting of clinical audit in veterinary medicine is sporadic despite the potential to improve patient care, though the true incidence of clinical audit reporting is likely to be underestimated due to incorrect indexing. Reporting standards of clinical audits are highly variable, limiting evaluation, application and repeatability of published work.},

The epidemiology and ecology of the virus during these inter-epidemic periods is poorly understood. There is evidence for low-level circulation of the virus in livestock and wild ruminants; however, as of yet there is no evidence to identify a specific mammalian reservoir host. Using a systematic approach, this review synthesizes results from serosurveys, attempts at viral detection, and experimental infection of wildlife. These data demonstrate there is a gap in research conducted on RVF in wild ruminants. Specifically, there is very little published data on the pathogenicity of an RVFV infection in various wildlife species, validation of diagnostic assays for exposure to RVFV and understanding of epizootic or endemic disease dynamics in wild ruminants. We recommend that future research on RVFV incorporate a more systematic approach to understand the low-level cycling of the virus during inter-epidemic periods in both wild and domestic ruminant species.},

DESIGN: Standardized, systematic evaluation of the literature, categorization of relevant articles according to level of evidence and quality, and development of consensus on conclusions for application of the concepts to clinical practice. SETTING: Academia, referral practice, and general practice RESULTS: Sixteen population, intervention, control group, outcome questions were evaluated to determine if recommendations could be made concerning drug therapy, including vasopressors, vagolytics, corticosteroids, reversal agents, buffer therapy, and correction of electrolyte disturbances. Electrical defibrillation strategies as well as other advanced interventions such as open-chest CPR, impedance threshold devices, and special considerations regarding anesthesia-related cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) were also investigated. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence supporting the use of standard-dose (0.01 mg/kg) epinephrine in CPR, as well as early electrical defibrillation for animals experiencing CPA due to ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, preferentially using a biphasic defibrillator. For CPA due to certain causes and with the availability of advanced postcardiac arrest support, open chest CPR is preferred. Many knowledge gaps regarding other pharmacologic and advanced therapies were identified, and further studies are recommended to better systematically address these questions.},

	abstract = {Since the 1980s, efforts have been made to develop sensors that measure a parameter from an individual cow. The development started with individual cow recognition and was followed by sensors that measure the electrical conductivity of milk and pedometers that measure activity. The aim of this review is to provide a structured overview of the published sensor systems for dairy health management. The development of sensor systems can be described by the following 4 levels: (I) techniques that measure something about the cow (e.g., activity); (II) interpretations that summarize changes in the sensor data (e.g., increase in activity) to produce information about the cow's status (e.g., estrus); (III) integration of information where sensor information is supplemented with other information (e.g., economic information) to produce advice (e.g., whether to inseminate a cow or not); and (IV) the farmer makes a decision or the sensor system makes the decision autonomously (e.g., the inseminator is called). This review has structured a total of 126 publications describing 139 sensor systems and compared them based on the 4 levels. The publications were published in the Thomson Reuters (formerly ISI) Web of Science database from January 2002 until June 2012 or in the proceedings of 3 conferences on precision (dairy) farming in 2009, 2010, and 2011. Most studies concerned the detection of mastitis (25\%), fertility (33\%), and locomotion problems (30\%), with fewer studies (16\%) related to the detection of metabolic problems. Many studies presented sensor systems at levels I and II, but none did so at levels III and IV. Most of the work for mastitis (92\%) and fertility (75\%) is done at level II. For locomotion (53\%) and metabolism (69\%), more than half of the work is done at level I. The performance of sensor systems varies based on the choice of gold standards, algorithms, and test sizes (number of farms and cows). Studies on sensor systems for mastitis and estrus have shown that sensor systems are brought to a higher level; however, the need to improve detection performance still exists. Studies on sensor systems for locomotion problems have shown that the search continues for the most appropriate indicators, sensor techniques, and gold standards. Studies on metabolic problems show that it is still unclear which indicator reflects best the metabolic problems that should be detected. No systems with integrated decision support models have been found.},

	abstract = {Bovine leukemia is a chronic, progressive, contagious tumor disease characterized by malignant lymphoid cell hyperplasia and systemic lymphadenopathy, and is caused by bovine leukemia virus (BLV). The disease affects almost all countries and regions where livestock are raised, and may even be a potential zoonotic disease. Monitoring and early prevention of bovine leukemia is very important. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis, the first of its type in the country, to estimate the prevalence of bovine leukemia in 1983-2019 in China. We included a total of 35 publications reported in 1983-2019 from the PubMed, ScienceDirect, Chinese Web of Knowledge (CNKI), VIP Chinese, and Wan Fang databases. In those articles, a total of 34,954 cattle had been tested, of which 4701 were positive for BLV infection. The estimated pooled BLV prevalence was 10.0\% (4701/34,954). Subgroup analysis showed that there were significant differences for sampling years, detection methods, and age. BLV prevalence was highest in the following subgroups: sampled before 1985 (38.5\%, 437/1134), age 3-5 years (22.5\%, 231/1044), and detected by PCR (17.9\%, 1228/5100). Regarding geographic factors, there were significant differences in the latitude and elevation subgroups. BLV prevalence was lowest in the subgroups of 20-30° latitude (3.3\%, 255/5069) 200-1000 m altitude (2.2\%, 560/11,990). We also analyzed other subgroups such as region, variety, breeding method, precipitation, humidity, and temperature, however, the differences were not significant. Our research indicated that the BLV was still prevalent in some of areas in China. We recommend strengthening the testing of cattle aged {\textgreater}1 year and using flexible testing methods such as PCR to control the prevalence of bovine leukemia and to prevent persistent infection.},

Previous studies reported that R. rosea L. improves learning and memory function in animal models. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis for preclinical studies to assess the current evidence for R. rosea L. effect on learning and memory function. Ultimately, 36 studies involving 836 animals were identified by searching 6 databases from inception to May 2018. The primary outcome measures included the escape latency in Morris water maze (MWM) test on behalf of learning ability, the frequency and the length of time spent on the target quadrant in MWM test representing memory function, and the number of errors in step down test, dark avoidance test and Y maze test on behalf of memory function. The secondary outcome measures were mechanisms of R. rosea L. for learning and/or memory function. Compared with control, the pooled results of 28 studies showed significant effects of R. rosea L. for reducing the escape latency (P {\textless} 0.05); 23 studies for increasing the frequency and the length of time spent on the target quadrant (P {\textless} 0.05); and 6 studies for decreasing the number of errors (P {\textless} 0.01). The possible mechanisms of R. rosea L. are largely through antioxidant, cholinergic regulation, anti-apoptosis activities, anti-inflammatory, improving coronary blood flow, and cerebral metabolism. In conclusion, the findings suggested that R. rosea L. can improve learning and memory function.},

Xingnaojing injection (XNJI) is widely used in the treatment of cerebral ischemia. The aim of this review is to evaluate the efficacy and mechanism of XNJI in animal models of cerebral ischemia. METHODS: Total seven electronic databases in English or Chinese (CNKI, Wanfang, VMIS, PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) about most experiments and studies which came out before June 2018 of XNJI for cerebral ischemia have been searched. Data extraction, quality assessment, and meta-analysis are conducted according to the Cochrane standards and RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: We have identified 23 eligible studies and made a meta-analysis based on these studies. Meta-analysis shows that XNJI contributes significantly to reduction in neurological deficit score (P = 0.0002, MD = -1.25, 95\% CI: -1.92, -0.58) compared with the control group of cerebral ischemia. Subgroup analytic results demonstrate that XNJI has been more effective in animal model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury (P = 0.009, MD = -1.35, 95\%CI: -2.36, -0.34) than that of permanent cerebral ischemia (P = 0.0002, MD = -1.08, 95\%CI: -1.66, -0.51). Compared with control group, XNJI could remarkably reduce cerebral infarction area (P {\textless} 0.00001, MD = -14.98, 95\%CI: -21.36, -8.59), brain edema (P {\textless} 0.00001, MD = -4.64, 95\%CI: -5.38, -3.90), and neuronal cell apoptosis (P {\textless} 0.0001, MD = -12.21, 95\%CI: 18.05, -6.37). Meanwhile, the meta-analysis shows that XNJI has a significant anti-inflammatory effect, and the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β are significantly reduced by XNJI (P = 0.001, MD = -4.13, 95\%CI:-6.68, -1.58; P {\textless} 0.00001, MD = -119.23, 95\%CI: -138.04, -100.43; P = 0.21, MD = -228.69, 95\% CI: -586.20, 128.83). Additionally, XNJI could raise the body's antioxidant function and the level of SOD and GSH-Px (P = 0.002, MD = 53.02, 95\% CI: -20.52, 85.78; P = 0.01, MD = 8.65, 95\% CI: 1.77, 15.48) and decrease the level of MDA (P {\textless} 0.00001, MD = -4.16, 95\% CI: -5.50, -2.82). CONCLUSION: XNJI might be effective in cerebral ischemia by regulating oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction.},

	abstract = {Ginger called Zingiber officinale (Z. officinale) belongs to Zingiberaceae family. In recent years, studies have shown that ginger may have effects on appetite, thermogenesis, and gastric motility. Due to these effects, the present study aimed to review of studies evaluating the effect of ginger on energy metabolism and obesity. The screening of the studies published was performed in 4 databases (PubMed-Web of Science-Lilacs-The Cochrane Library). Among the 1428 studies, only 20 studies had sufficient data to be included in the systematic review. Literature shows that ginger may have important effects on energy metabolism and obesity in animal models via decreased carbohydrate and lipids oxidation, increased nerve activity, changes in hormone (leptin, insulin) and enzymes (amylase, lipase). Some human studies also show positive effects; however, the results are conflicting because of difference in active ingredients, low dose, and short administration period (single dose, 24 hours). In meta-analysis of studies showed that ginger significantly decrease BMI (95\% CI:1.33 -4.02 to 1.84, p=.003). In conclusion, the association of ginger with energy metabolism and obesity may have positive effects. However, before a clear recommendation can be made determination of the active ingredient and optimal duration and dose, as well as possible effects with long-term usage.},

The datasets for rhesus macaques exposure to mixed neutron:gamma radiation are used herein as a species comparative reference to the canine database. The selection of data cohorts was made from the following sources: Ovid Medline (1957-present), PubMed (1954-present), AGRICOLA (1976-present), Web of Science (1954-present), and US HHS RePORT (2002-present). The total number of hits across all search sites was 3,077. Several referenced, unpublished, non-peer reviewed government reports were unavailable for review. Primary published studies using canines, beagles, and mongrels were evaluated to provide an informative and consistent review of mixed neutron:gamma radiation effects to establish the DRRs for the H-ARS. Secondary and tertiary studies provided additional information on the hematologic response or the effects on hematopoietic progenitor cells, radiation dosimetry, absorbed dose, and organ dose. The LD50/30 values varied with neutron quality, exposure aspect, and mixed neutron:gamma ratio. The reference radiation quality varied from 250 kVp or 1-2 MeV x radiation and Co gamma radiation. A summary of a published review of a data set describing the DRR in rhesus macaques for mixed neutron:gamma radiation exposure in the H-ARS is included for a comparative reference to the canine dataset. The available evidence provided a reliable and extensive database that characterized the DRR for the H-ARS in canines and young rhesus macaques exposed to mixed neutron:gamma radiations of variable energy relative to 250 kVp, 1-2 MeV x radiation and Co gamma, and uniform and non-uniform total-body irradiation without the benefit of medical management. The mixed neutron:gamma radiation showed an energy-dependent RBE of {\textasciitilde} 1.0 to 2.0 relative to reference radiation exposure within both species. A marginal database described the DRR for the gastrointestinal (GI)-ARS. Medical management showed benefit in both species relative to the mixed neutron:gamma as well as exposure to reference radiation. The DRR for the H-ARS was characterized by steep slopes and relative LD50/30 values that reflected the radiation quality, exposure aspect, and dose rate over a range in time from 1956-2012.},

	abstract = {The 2013 global farmed shrimp production totalled 4.3 million tons, whereas the production of Litopenaeus vannamei as non-native species represented the 64\% of that amount. The risks of introducing non-native or exotic species are a growing environmental concern. Therefore, the objective of this study was to discuss updated information about the introduction of non-native species and to evaluate the efficiency indicators of non-native species in contrast to native ones. The results of a systematic revision of the publications about shrimp farming are presented, comparing the zootechnical performance of native and non-native species, with the use of meta-analysis tools. The conducted search returned 4680 results, corresponding to the articles that included one of the criteria previously established by the present work. Seven publications, which included 22 studies, met the requirements for the meta-analysis. The effect size calculated was positive, meaning that, according to the considered data, the use of non-native species resulted generally in higher values of growth rate in relation to the native species observed. Other aspects like the emergence and dissemination of the main viral diseases affecting global shrimp farming were also revised. We conclude that, although the advantages of using non-native species, especially L. vannamei, over native species are clear, there are enough compelling evidences to support the viability of small-scale native species farming. We also discussed why big companies, governments and associations related to the production and commerce of farmed shrimp should finance and support the development of native species farming.},

	abstract = {In general, bone fractures are able of healing by itself. However, in critical situations such as large bone defects, poor blood supply or even infections, the biological capacity of repair can be impaired, resulting in a delay of the consolidation process or even in non-union fractures. Thus, technologies able of improving the process of bone regeneration are of high demand. In this context, ceramic biomaterials-based bone substitutes and photobiomodulation (PBM) have been emerging as promising alternatives. Thus, the present study performed a systematic review targeting to analyze studies in the literature which investigated the effects of the association of ceramic based bone substitutes and PBM in the process of bone healing using animal models of bone defects. The search was conducted from March and April of 2019 in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus databases. After the eligibility analyses, 16 studies were included in this review. The results showed that the most common material used was hydroxyapatite (HA) followed by Biosilicate associated with infrared PBM. Furthermore, 75\% of the studies demonstrated positive effects to stimulate bone regeneration from association of ceramic biomaterials and PBM. All studies used low-level laser therapy (LLLT) device and the most studies used LLLT infrared. The evidence synthesis was moderate for all experimental studies for the variable histological analysis demonstrating the efficacy of techniques on the process of bone repair stimulation. In conclusion, this review demonstrates that the association of ceramic biomaterials and PBM presented positive effects for bone repair in experimental models of bone defects.},

METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in a Cochrane style and in accordance PRISMA checklist using the published studies in PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and EMBASE databases that were searched up to January 2019. Abstracts that met PICO criteria for qualitative studies underwent dual review for data extraction to evaluate study quality and details. RESULTS: Dietary supplementation with N. sativa preparations can improve various secondary complications of diabetic patients. N. sativa preparations possess antidiabetic, hypoglycemic, anti-hyperlipidemic, antihypertensive, and anti-obesity effects. Beneficial effects of N. sativa preparations include the restoration of the antioxidant defense systems, the increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes, the decrease of inflammatory biomarkers, the suppression of the production pro-inflammatory mediators, improvement of endothelial dysfunction, and hepatic, kidney, heart and immune system functions. They have key roles in managing diabetes-induced inflammation and oxidative stress in diabetic patients. CONCLUSION: N. sativa preparations have key roles in herbal medicine as an adjuvant in the treatment and management of patients with DM and its complications. Moreover, the beneficial effects of N. sativa preparations were differently based on dosage forms, active ingredients, and duration of intervention. The best dosage to improve glycemic indices and lipid and lipoprotein profiles is 2 g daily powdered N. sativa for at least 12 weeks.},

In some studies, there was no effect of this SNP on litter size, while in other studies there was an effect. In the present study there was a meta-analysis conducted by pooling results from 11 eligible published studies to investigate effects of c.1189G{\textgreater}A polymorphism on litter size using four different genetic models including dominant (AA + AG compared with GG), recessive (AA compared with AG + GG), additive (AA compared with GG) and co-dominant (AA + GG compared with AG). Data were analyzed using fixed and random-effect models based on the I-squared value. Results indicate the c.1189G{\textgreater}A polymorphism is positively associated with litter size with use of the dominant model (SMD = 0.093, 95\% CI = 0.028 to 0.158, P-Value = 0.005).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Echinococcosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the larval stages of taeniid cestodes of the genus Echinococcus. The two major types of infection in humans are cystic echinococcosis (CE) or hydatidosis and alveolar echinococcosis (AE). It is endemic in some parts of the world, such as the Middle East, with Iran being a part of it. This systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to determine the prevalence of CE and AE echinococcosis and their epidemiological and clinical aspects in Iran. METHODS: Electronic databases, including MEDLINE (via PubMed), SCOPUS, Web of Science, SID and Mag Iran (two Persian scientific search engines) were searched from 1 January 1990 to 8 August 2017. The prevalence of CE and AE echinococcosis was estimated using the random effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was evaluated by subgroup analysis. Data were analyzed by STATA version 12. RESULTS: Of the 2051 records identified in the mentioned electronic databases, Seventy-eight articles met our eligibility criteria, with a total of 214124individuals. The meta-analysis was performed on only 37 out of 78 included studies. The pooled prevalence of CE and AE in Iran was 5\% [95\% confidence interval )CI(: 3-6\%] and 2\% [95\% CI: 0-5\%], respectively. Subgroup meta-analysis revealed that the prevalence of CE was significantly higher in North [9\%, 95\% CI: 4-18\%] and West of Iran [6\%, 95\% CI: 3-11\%], patients younger than 40 years of age [7\%, 95\% CI: 4-12\%], villagers and nomads [6\%, 95\% CI: 2-12\%], and studies that used the combination of serological, clinical, and imaging diagnostic methods [7\%, 95\% CI: 5-9\%]. There were no significant differences between the prevalence of CE among low and high-quality studies. Housewives were the most affected group by hydatidosis (n=24/77, 31\%), followed by illiterate people (n=11/77, 14\%) and farmers (n= 9/77, 12\%). Liver [55\%, 95\% CI: 46-65\%] and lung [28\%, 95\% CI, 22-35\%] were the most common sites of cyst formation. CONCLUSIONS: Given to the importance of echinococcosis on human health and domestic animals industry, it is necessary to implement monitoring and control measures in this regard.},

The inducing agents and exposure (dose and duration) differed from non-physiological to clinically relevant doses. The majority of studies reported other biomarkers and/or histological confirmation of the imaging results. Summary of radiotracers and examples of imaging biomarkers were summarized, and the types of animal models and the most used imaging modalities and applications are discussed in this review. Pathologies resembling DIILD, such as inflammation and fibrosis, were described in many papers, but only a few explicitly addressed drug-induced toxicity experiments.},

	abstract = {Glucosinolates (GSs) are common anionic plant secondary metabolites in the order Brassicales. Together with glucosinolate hydrolysis products (GSHPs), they have recently gained much attention due to their biological activities and mechanisms of action. We review herein the health benefits of GSs/GSHPs, approaches to improve the plant contents, their bioavailability and bioactivity. In this review, only literature published between 2010 and March 2020 was retrieved from various scientific databases. Findings indicate that these compounds (natural, pure, synthetic, and derivatives) play an important role in human/animal health (disease therapy and prevention), plant health (defense chemicals, biofumigants/biocides), and food industries (preservatives). Overall, much interest is focused on in vitro studies as anti-cancer and antimicrobial agents. GS/GSHP levels improvement in plants utilizes mostly biotic/abiotic stresses and short periods of phytohormone application. Their availability and bioactivity are directly proportional to their contents at the source, which is affected by methods of food preparation, processing, and extraction. This review concludes that, to a greater extent, there is a need to explore and improve GS-rich sources, which should be emphasized to obtain natural bioactive compounds/active ingredients that can be included among synthetic and commercial products for use in maintaining and promoting health. Furthermore, the development of advanced research on compounds pharmacokinetics, their molecular mode of action, genetics based on biosynthesis, their uses in promoting the health of living organisms is highlighted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is essential to further improve outcomes after liver transplantation (LT). Porcine isolated liver perfusion (ILP) is increasingly used to reproduce LT-associated IRI in a strictly controlled environment. However, whether ILP is a reliable substitute of LT was never validated. METHODS: We systematically reviewed the current experimental setups for ILP and parameters of interest reflecting IRI. RESULTS: Isolated liver perfusion was never compared with transplantation in animals. Considerable variability exists between setups, and comparative data are unavailable. Experience so far suggests that centrifugal pump(s) with continuous flow are preferred to reduce the risk of embolism. Hepatic outflow can be established by cannulation of the inferior vena cava or freely drained in an open bath. Whole blood at approximately 38°C, hematocrit of 20\% or greater, and the presence of leukocytes to trigger inflammation is considered the optimal perfusate. A number of parameters related to the 4 liver compartments (hepatocyte, cholangiocyte, endothelium, immune cells) are available; however, their significance and relation to clinical outcomes is not well described. CONCLUSIONS: Porcine ILP provides a reproducible model to study early IRI events. As all models, it has its limitations. A standardization of the setup would allow comparison of data and progress in the field.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jss.2019.12.022},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anastomotic leak rates have not improved over several decades despite improvements in surgical techniques and patient care. The gut microbiome has been implicated in the development of leaks. The exact mechanisms by which tissue oxygenation affects gut microbial composition and anastomotic healing physiology are unclear. Also, commonly used carbon dioxide (CO(2)) is a known vasodilator that improves tissue oxygen tension. We performed a systematic review to determine the influence of hyperoxia, hypoxia, and hypercapnia on the gut microbiome and anastomotic healing. METHODS: A literature search was performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and COCHRANE to identify studies investigating the effects of hyperoxia, hypoxia, and hypercapnia on anastomotic healing and gut microbiota published between 1998 and 2018. Two reviewers screened the articles for eligibility and quality. Fifty-three articles underwent full text review, and a narrative synthesis was undertaken. RESULTS: Hyperoxia is associated with better anastomotic healing, increased gastrointestinal oxygen tension, and may reduce gut anaerobes. Hypoxia is associated with poor healing and increased gut anaerobes. However, it is unclear if hypoxia is the most important predictor of anastomotic leaks. Low pressure CO(2) pneumoperitoneum and mild systemic hypercapnia are both associated with increased gastrointestinal oxygen tension and may improve anastomotic healing. We found no studies which investigated the effect of hypercapnia on gut microbiota in the context of anastomotic healing. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue oxygenation influences gut anastomotic healing, but little evidence exists to demonstrate the influence on the gut microbiome in the context of healing. Further studies are needed to determine if anastomotic microbiome changes with altered tissue oxygenation and if this affects healing and leak rates. If confirmed, altering tissue oxygenation through hyperoxia or hypercapnia could be feasible means of altering the microbiome such that anastomotic leak rates reduce.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimal medical treatment for chronic enteropathy (CE) in dogs and cats is controversial. Sequential treatment using diet, antimicrobials, and immunosuppressive drugs is the most common strategy used by clinicians. OBJECTIVES: To review the evidence for the effectiveness of dietary, drug, and alternative health interventions for inducing clinical remission in dogs and cats with CE. ANIMALS: Retrospective study of dogs and cats with a diagnosis of chronic enteropathy. METHODS: MEDLINE and Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International (CABI) databases (1950 to March 2017) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies, and case series. The primary outcome was induction of clinical remission. All studies were evaluated using the quality of evidence grading guidelines (I-IV), which assign a score defining the strength and quality of the evidence. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies (11 RCTs in dogs and 2 in cats and 9 cohort studies or case series) met the inclusion criteria for inducing remission of gastrointestinal (GI) signs. Of the 13 RCTs achieving grade I scores, 10 studies (totaling 218 dogs and 65 cats) compared single treatment: diet (n = 3), immunosuppressives (n = 3), antimicrobials (n = 2), anti-inflammatory drugs (n = 1), and probiotics (n = 1). Three case series (grade III) reported clinical remission using an elimination diet fed to 55 cats and use of enrofloxacin to induce remission in dogs with granulomatous colitis (2 studies totaling 16 dogs). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The current evidence for treatment of CE is much greater in dogs than in cats. There is sufficient strong evidence to recommend the use of therapeutic GI diets, glucocorticoids, enrofloxacin, or some combination of these in dogs with CE. Therapeutic GI diets and glucocorticoids are most useful in cats with CE.},

SELECTION CRITERIA: Animal controlled studies investigating the effect of pain relievers on the rate of orthodontic tooth movement. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Following study retrieval and selection, relevant data were extracted and the risk of bias was assessed using the SYRCLE's risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were finally identified, most of which at unclear risk of bias. Ibuprofen and loxoprofen did not show any significant effects on the rate of orthodontic tooth movement, whereas indomethacin, ketorolac, morphine, and high doses of etoricoxib were found to decrease it. Inconsistent or conflicting effects were noted after the administration of acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, celecoxib, meloxicam, and tramadol. The quality of the available evidence was considered at best as low. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term consumption of pain relievers may affect the rate of orthodontic tooth movement.

OBJECTIVES: To systematically investigate and appraise the quality of the available evidence from animal studies, regarding the effect of commonly prescribed systemic medication on root resorption associated with orthodontic tooth movement. SEARCH METHODS: Search without restrictions in eight databases (PubMed, Central, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Arab World Research Source, ClinicalTrials.gov, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global) and hand searching until April 2018 took place. One author developed detailed search strategies for each database that were based on the PubMed strategy and adapted accordingly. SELECTION CRITERIA: Controlled studies investigating the effect of systemic medications on root resorption associated with orthodontic tooth movement. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Following study retrieval and selection, relevant data were extracted and the risk of bias was assessed using the SYRCLE's Risk of Bias Tool. RESULTS: Twenty-one studies were finally identified, most of which at unclear risk of bias. Root resorption was shown to increase in Vitamin C treated animals in comparison with the control group, whereas a comparative decrease was noted after the administration of the alendronate, ibuprofen, growth hormone, low doses of meloxicam, simvastatin, lithium chloride and strontium ranelate. No difference was noted for acetaminophen, aspirin, fluoxetine, atorvastatin, misoprostol, zoledronic acid and zinc. Finally, inconsistent effects were observed after the administration of celecoxib, prednisolone and L-thyroxine. The quality of the available evidence was considered at best as low. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmaceutical substances investigated were shown to exhibit variable effects on root resorption. Although the overall quality of evidence provides the clinician with a cautious perspective on the strength of the relevant recommendations, good practice would suggest that it is important to identify patients consuming medications and consider the possible implications.

	abstract = {A healthy riparian ecosystem is essential to maintain instream water quality, decrease stream bank erosion, increase bank stability and prevent soil loss within river systems, which in turn may affect coastal water quality. The presence of cattle within the riparian zone is a common feature of grazing ventures, but can negatively impact on the functionality of riparian ecosystems. Therefore, the provision of offstream watering points (OSWPs) as an alternative watering source for cattle may lessen or prevent the impact cattle have on the riparian zone. A systematic review was conducted to identify: (1) which factors influence how cattle use OSWPs, and (2) if the provision of an OSWP is an effective best management practice to reduce the time cattle spent in riparian zones, potentially limiting the impact cattle may have on instream water quality and riparian habitat particularly stream bank vegetation. A total of 37 from 1135 research papers satisfied the initial selection criteria for the review with seven providing sufficient information to conduct a meta-analysis. Out of the 37 papers a total of seven factors and five sub-factors influencing cattle's use of OSWPs were identified. There is evidence that OSWPs did reduce the time cattle spent in riparian zones, however with great variation (63.7\%) among studies. The review further highlights that substantial knowledge gaps exist within the literature linking the interaction of cattle, OSWPs and riparian habitats indicating the need for further research.},

The reviewed literature showed that both Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica are present in East and Southern Africa, and infect a wide range of domestic and wild ruminants. Fasciola gigantica was reported in six East African and five Southern African countries, where Radix natalensis (found in low altitudes) was reported to be the main IH. Fasciola hepatica was reported in Tanzania and Ethiopia (East Africa), and in South Africa and Zimbabwe (Southern Africa), where Galba truncatula (found in high altitudes) was documented as the IH in all countries except in Zimbabwe. Both Fasciola species were documented in Tanzania, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. An overlap of the two was observed in areas with an intermediate altitude in Ethiopia and South Africa, where Pseudosuccinea columella was widespread and assumed to transmit both species. Pseudosuccinea columella has been reported in South Africa and Namibia, and proven to transmit F. gigantica in South Africa; its role in Namibia in the transmission of Fasciola species has not been reported. Other lymnaeid species such as R. rubiginosa were reported in South Africa, and R. auricularia in South Africa and Botswana; their role in the transmission of Fasciola species has not been proven.

	abstract = {Chitosan is a natural polysaccharide with biocompatibility, biodegradability, nontoxicity, antimicrobial, and hemostatic properties. This biopolymer has been used in different pharmaceutical forms; therefore, it has an attractive potential for dermal applications in veterinary medicine. The aim of this review is to assess the healing potential of chitosan, based on its dermatological effects on animals, to enrich the therapeutic options of veterinary clinicians. A systematic review was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) strategy, retrieving 1,032 studies and selecting 39 after the inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. The studies included reports with confirmed positive effects (n = 46/99, 46.5 \%) (P {\textless} 0.05), with positive effects (n = 49.5/99, 49.5 \%), and with no effect (n = 4/99, 4 \%); none of the studies reported adverse effects. There is an association between frequency of application and a decrease in healing time (P = 0.038); applying chitosan "every 48-72 hours" was the most recommended frequency (n = 10/19, 52.9 \%). Chitosan, when applied to skin lesions on animals, produces positive effects on healing, potentially becoming a safe biomaterial for skin treatments in veterinary practice. As an initial protocol, we suggest applying chitosan every 48-72 hours for at least 2 weeks (7 applications).},

	abstract = {Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic and cosmopolitan infection. Although a few studies have evaluated the prevalence of Toxoplasma oocysts in the soil of public places, the present study was conducted to provide insights into environmental contamination levels and its potential transmission to humans on a global scale. A systematic search was conducted using bibliographic databases through 30 August 2020. A random effects model was utilized to estimate pooled prevalence with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analysis and meta-regressions were also performed on the geographical and environmental parameters. Finally, 22 articles, wherein 15 420 soil samples were examined, met the systematic review and meta-analysis requirements. The mean pooled prevalence of Toxoplasma oocysts was estimated at 16\% (95\% CI 10 to 26) in public places. The estimated prevalences in Europe, South America, Asia and North America were 23\% (95\% CI 4 to 65), 22\% (95\% CI 18 to 26), 15\% (95\% CI 0.06 to 33) and 8\% (95\% CI 0.00 to 97), respectively. An increasing trend was observed in the prevalence of Toxoplasma oocysts with increasing latitude (41-56 degrees ), decreasing longitude (0-40 degrees ) and increasing relative humidity (76\%). Loop-mediated isothermal amplification and polymerase chain reaction methods revealed the highest and lowest prevalence rates, respectively, in the detection of Toxoplasma oocysts. Awareness of the health authorities and people about Toxoplasma prevalence in the soil of public places and its risk factors is of great importance to developing effective strategies to prevent infection.},

	abstract = {Background: Although some studies have reported the beneficial effects of milk and dairy product consumption on osteoporosis and risk of fracture, the findings are conflicting.Purpose: We summarized earlier data on the association between milk and dairy intake and risk of osteoporosis and hip fracture through a meta-analysis.Methods: A systematic literature search of relevant reports published in PubMed, ISI (Web of Science), EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar until August 2018 was conducted.Results: Total dairy intake was protectively associated with reduced risk of osteoporosis based on cross-sectional and case-control studies (0.63; 95\% CI: 0.55-0.73). Milk consumption was not associated with the risk of osteoporosis (overall RR = 0.79; 95\% CI: 0.57-1.08). In non-linear dose-response meta-analysis, increase intake of dairy (at the level of 0 to 250 grams per day) was associated with a reduced risk of osteoporosis (P(nonlinearty) = 0.005). Meta-regression of included studies revealed an inverse linear association between dairy and milk intake and risk of osteoporosis; such that every additional 200-gram intake of dairy and milk was associated with a 22\% and 37\% reduced risk of osteoporosis, respectively. In terms of hip fracture, milk consumption was associated with a 25\% reduced risk of hip fracture only in cross-sectional and case-control studies (overall RR = 0.75; 95\%CI: 0.57-0.99). In linear meta-regression, every additional 200-gram milk intake per day was associated with a 9\% greater risk of hip fracture in cohort studies.Conclusion: Despite an inverse association between milk and dairy intake and risk of osteoporosis and hip fracture in cross-sectional and case-control studies, no such association was seen in cohort studies. Given the advantages of the cohort over case-control studies, we concluded that a greater intake of milk and dairy products was not associated with a lower risk of osteoporosis and hip fracture.},

	abstract = {In Vietnam, pork is the most commonly consumed type of meat, and the demand is expected to rise even further. Nevertheless, food safety is a major concern, as the country bears a high burden of food-borne diseases, including these caused by pork products. Knowledge of the flows of pigs and pork from producers up to the consumers is important; however, up to now, a comprehensive overview is lacking. We addressed this by conducting a systematic review on the pork value chain (PVC) mapping for the country. Four international and three Vietnamese databases were searched for data on the pork value chain in Vietnam, and the results were reported according to the PRISMA guidelines. Data obtained from the retained records showed that 10 main PVC types are present in Vietnam, comprising of five main actors including: producers, middlemen, slaughter men, retailers and consumers. Among the identified chains, the one involving producers, slaughter men, retailers and consumers is the most common one, with up to 75\% of pork following this route. In cities or export routes to other countries, middlemen and/or traders are important additional actors in the PVCs. The small scale of PVC linkages is prominent. The presence of middlemen, pig traders and pork traders is contributing to further distribution of pork products in geographical terms. Transactions between actors in the traditional PVCs in Vietnam are characterized by the absence of official contracts; therefore, the linkages in the chains are loose and the origin of pork is not traceable. More industrial forms of PVCs are slowly developing; however, the traditional PVCs are still prevailing in Vietnam. The weak linkages between actors and poor hygienic practices in these chains form a risk to pork safety.},

The search on PubMed (MED-LINE) was carried out with the following keywords: sinus augmentation OR sinus lift AND bovine bone graft OR equine bone matrix. The articles identified included randomised clinical trials, cross-sectional studies and case series. Outcomes were the percentage of newly formed bone, remaining graft particles and soft tissue in a follow-up at least of 5 months. The use of bovine bone graft (ABB) as a graft material in maxillary sinus elevation was evaluated in 9 studies. According to the quality assessment, 4 of the 9 studies were analysed and an arithmetic mean was performed showing the following results: newly formed bone (NFB 22.74\%), residual grafts (RG 29.36\%) and soft tissue percentage (SF 48.51\%). The use of equine bone matrix (EBM) was assessed in four different studies including an RCT, a cross-sectional study and two case series; a mean percentage calculated by the extracted data of the four studies was estimated with newly formed bone (NFB 44.51\%), residual grafts (RG 17.24\%) and soft tissue percentage (SF 36.62\%).

Articles related with genotypes of E. granulosus, in humans, without language neither genotyped method restriction, published between 1990-2019 were included. A systematic in WoS, EMBASE, MEDLINE, SCOPUS, Trip Database, BIREME, SciELO, LILACS, IBECS, and PAHO-WHO was carried out. In study variables were year of publication, country, number of samples, host and parasite organs, genotype identified, molecular marker and genes. Descriptive statistics were applied. RESULTS: 701 related articles were identified; 62 fulfilled selection criteria, representing 1,511 samples. The existing evidence was published between 1994 and 2019; and mainly comes from Iran (45.2\%). The most commonly used sequencing method was PCR amplification and Sanger type sequencing with partial or total genotyping of the cox1 gene. Genotyped method most frequently used was cox1 (79,0\%). Genotypes most frequently identified were G1 and G1/G3 complex (49.1\% and 32.2\%). CONCLUSIONS: Publications related to genotypes of Eg in humans are scarce, heterogeneous, and presenting differing results. Eg G1/G3 accounts for most of the global burden worldwide.},

Overall, the fewer types of species and models used did not correlate with an increased standardization in the experimental characteristics and procedures. However, by species, commonly applied, reliable parameters for each experimental SAH technique were identified in mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog models.

Different strategies have been employed to enhance bone healing among which the use of autologous platelet concentrates (APCs). Due to the high content of platelets and platelet-derived bioactive molecules (e.g., growth factors, antimicrobial peptides), they are promising candidates to enhance bone healing. However, both preclinical and clinical studies produced contrasting results, mainly due to a high heterogeneity in study design, objectives, techniques adopted, and outcomes assessed. The aim of the present systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of APCs in animal models of bone regeneration, considering the possible factors that might affect the outcome. An electronic search was performed on MEDLINE and Scopus databases. Comparative animal studies with a minimum follow up of 2 weeks, at least five subjects per group and using APCs for regeneration of bone defects were included. Articles underwent risk of bias assessment and quality evaluation. Fifty studies performed on six animal species (rat, rabbit, dog, sheep, goat, mini-pig) were included. The present part of the review considers studies performed on small ruminants, dogs, and mini-pigs (14 articles). The majority of the studies were considered at low risk of bias. In general, APCs' adjunct positively affected bone regeneration. Animal species, platelet and growth factors concentration, type of bone defect and of platelet concentrate used seemed to influence their efficacy in bone healing. However, sound conclusions were not drawn since too few studies for each large-size animal model were included. In addition, characterization of APCs' content was performed only in a few studies. Further studies with a standardized protocol including characterization of the final products will provide useful information for translating the results to clinical application of APCs in bone surgery.},

Aim of the present systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of platelet concentrates in animal models of bone regeneration, considering the possible factors which might affect the outcome. An electronic search was performed on MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases. Animal studies with a minimum follow up of 2 weeks and a sample size of five subjects per group, using platelet concentrates for bone regeneration, were included. Articles underwent risk of bias assessment and further quality evaluation was done. Sixty studies performed on six animal species (rat, rabbit, dog, sheep, goat, and mini-pig) were included. The present part of the review considers only studies performed on rats and rabbits (35 articles). The majority of the studies were considered at medium risk of bias. Animal species, healthy models, platelet, growth factors and leukocytes concentration, and type of bone defect seemed to influence the efficacy of platelet concentrates in bone healing. However, final conclusions were not be drawn, since only few included studies evaluated leukocyte, growth factor content, or presence of other bioactive molecules in platelet concentrates. Further studies with a standardized protocol including characterization of the final products will provide useful information for clinical application of platelet concentrates in bone surgery.},

	abstract = {Background: The control of vector-borne diseases (VBD) is one of the greatest challenges on the global health agenda. Rapid and uncontrolled urbanization has heightened the interest in addressing these challenges through an integrated vector management (IVM) approach. The aim was to identify components related to impacts, economic evaluation, and sustainability that might contribute to this integrated approach to VBD prevention. Main body We conducted a scoping review of available literature (2000-2016) using PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane, CINAHL, Econlit, LILACS, Global Health Database, Scopus, and Embase, as well as Tropical Diseases Bulletin, WHOLIS, WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme, and Google Scholar. MeSH terms and free-text terms were used. A data extraction form was used, including TIDieR and ASTAIRE. MMAT and CHEERS were used to evaluate quality. Of the 42 documents reviewed, 30 were focused on dengue, eight on malaria, and two on leishmaniasis. More than a half of the studies were conducted in the Americas. Half used a quantitative descriptive approach (n=21), followed by cluster randomized controlled trials (n=11). Regarding impacts, outcomes were: (a) use of measures for vector control; (b) vector control; (c) health measures; and (d) social measures. IVM reduced breeding sites, the entomology index, and parasite rates. Results were heterogeneous, with variable magnitudes, but in all cases were favourable to the intervention. Evidence of IVM impacts on health outcomes was very limited but showed reduced incidence. Social outcomes were improved abilities and capacities, empowerment, and community knowledge. Regarding economic evaluation, only four studies performed an economic analysis, and intervention benefits outweighed costs. Cost-effectiveness was dependent on illness incidence. The results provided key elements to analyze sustainability in terms of three dimensions (social, economic, and environmental), emphasizing the implementation of a community-focused eco-bio-social approach. Conclusions: IVM has an impact on reducing vector breeding sites and the entomology index, but evidence of impacts on health outcomes is limited. Social outcomes are improved abilities and capacities, empowerment, and community knowledge. Economic evaluations are scarce, and cost-effectiveness is dependent on illness incidence. Community capacity building is the main component of sustainability, together with collaboration, institutionalization, and routinization of activities. Findings indicate a great heterogeneity in the interventions and highlight the need for characterizing interventions rigorously to facilitate transferability.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Internet search of the literature was performed on June 2016 based on specific keywords. The search process included 5 databases. The Animal Research Reporting In Vivo Experiment (ARRIVE) guidelines was used to assess the quality of the included studies. RESULTS: Nine studies have met the inclusion criteria and subjected to quality evaluation. All the defects (N = 156) were located in the mandible. Only 2 articles showed randomized controlled studies, whereas the remaining 7 were nonrandomized controlled studies. The geometry of the defects was either rectangular, box, cylindrical (circular), arch, or saddle shaped. CONCLUSION: There is a lack of homogeneity in reporting data on CSDs in the dog mandible. Future animal studies should include a negative control group for an objective comparison and evaluation of any new biomedical materials. More awareness is needed for the Animal Research Reporting In Vivo Experiment (ARRIVE) guidelines to improve data reporting, which can facilitate comparison and reproducibility of future studies.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to estimate the productive and economic impacts caused by the withdrawal of antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) from broilers diet. Indexed publications that compared diets with or without AGP (AGP+/AGP-) for broilers (from initial to final phase) were collected and the results of feed intake, weight gain, and feed conversion were compiled in a database. A meta-analysis was performed following sequential analyses: graphical approach (to observe biological data coherence), correlation (to identify related factors), and variance-covariance (to compare groups). The annual number of broiler slaughtered in Brazil, target weight gain and feed conversion for each phase, the variation in feed conversion, feed cost, and AGP costs were used to build a model to estimate the effects of the AGP withdrawal on feeding costs. The database comprised 174 scientific articles containing 183 experiments, totaling 121,643 broilers, most of which were Ross (52\% of the studies). The most frequent AGP sources/forms in the database were Avilamycin (41\% of the AGP+ treatments), Flavomycin (19\%), Virginiamycin (16\%), and Bacitracin (14\%). Higher feed intake, weight gain, and lower feed conversion were attributed (P {\textless} 0.05) to AGP+ diets during Initial phase (1 to 21 D). In Final phase (22 to 42 D) no differences were observed in performance variables. Treatments AGP+ presented higher weight gain and better feed conversion in the Total period (1 to 42 D). The results of feed conversion were improved (P {\textless} 0.05) with Avilamycin and Flavomycin; Virginiamycin improved weight gain and feed conversion. In the Total period, the economic impact was \$0.03 per animal and a total of \$183,560,232 per year. It was concluded that broilers fed AGP+ diets have higher weight gain and better feed conversion than those fed AGP- diets, and withdrawing AGP increases production costs.},

Peer-reviewed articles were retrieved from multiple databases (SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar). Reference lists of the articles retrieved were also screened to identify key authors for inclusion. Articles were subject to a quality review, and the results synthesised to address the research questions. Both qualitative and quantitative data were reported. There was evidence of the potential positive effects of dog-assisted interventions in relation to mood, prosocial behaviours, activities of daily living and/or quality of life, cognitive impairment and symptoms specific to dementia, and existential functions. However, the form and quality of the studies varied considerably. It was concluded that further research is needed, particularly for those with younger onset dementia (YOD), for whom there were no specific studies available. Attention needs to be given to establishing adequate-sized samples and designs incorporating control groups. Research would benefit from employing mixed-methods, allowing for the triangulation of qualitative and quantitative data. For deteriorating conditions such as the dementias, studies need to be conducted over time. Furthermore, given the important place family members play in the lives of those with dementia, the effects of dog-assisted interventions on the wider family should also be considered.},

	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is among the most prevalent diseases in the world, affecting over 420 million people. The disease is marked by a poor metabolic effect of insulin leading to chronic hyperglycaemia, which can result in microvascular complications. It is widely known that postprandial glycaemia is reliant on the total carbohydrate content of a meal. However, the importance of the amount and the source of these carbohydrates remains controversial due to mechanisms other than insulin secretion. Oxidative stress, inflammation, pyruvate production and the quality of the intestinal microbiota, resulting in plasma lipopolysaccharides and short-chain fatty acids production, play an important role in blood sugar control and consequently in type 2 diabetes. Thus, we systematically reviewed the preclinical evidences on the impact of the amount and type of carbohydrate found in different diets and its influence on blood glucose levels in diabetic animals. We used a comprehensive and structured search in biomedical databases Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Web of Science, recovering and analyzing 27 original studies. Results showed that sucrose-rich diets deteriorated diabetic condition in animal models regardless of the total dietary carbohydrate content. On the other hand, fiber, particularly resistant starch, improved blood glucose parameters through direct and indirect mechanisms, such as delayed gastric emptying and improved gut microbiota. All studies used rodents as animal models and male animals were preferred over females. Improvements in T2DM parameters in animal models were more closely related to the type of dietary carbohydrate than to its content on a diet, i. e., resistant starch seems to be the most beneficial source for maintaining normoglycemia. Results show that current literature is at high risk of bias due to neglecting experimental methods.},

The crosstalk between gut microbiota and host metabolism is closely related to T2DM. Currently, fragmented data hamper defining the relationship between probiotics and T2DM. This systematic review aimed at investigating the effects of probiotics on T2DM in animal models. We systematically reviewed preclinical evidences using PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus databases, recovering 24 original articles published until September 27th, 2019. This systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. We included experimental studies with animal models reporting the effects of probiotics on T2DM. Studies were sorted by characteristics of publications, animal models, performed analyses, probiotic used and interventions. Bias analysis and methodological quality assessments were examined through the SYRCLE's Risk of Bias tool. Probiotics improved T2DM in 96\% of the studies. Most studies (96\%) used Lactobacillus strains, and all of them led to improved glycaemia. All studies used rodents as models, and male animals were preferred over females. Results suggest that probiotics have a beneficial effect in T2DM animals and could be used as a supporting alternative in the disease treatment. Considering a detailed evaluation of the reporting and methodological quality, the current preclinical evidence is at high risk of bias. We hope that our critical analysis will be useful in mitigating the sources of bias in further studies.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To investigate the association between the bird-beak configuration (BBC), a wedge-shaped gap between the undersurface of a thoracic endograft and the lesser curvature of the arch after thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR), and postoperative outcome after TEVAR. Methods: The study was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. The PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched to identify all case series reporting BBC after TEVAR between 2006 and April 2018. Data analysis was performed considering the difference in the risk of complications for presence vs absence of BBC. After screening 1633 articles, 21 studies were identified that matched the selection criteria; 12 of these reported detailed information to investigate the postoperative outcome using proportion meta-analysis with a random effects model. The pooled risk difference is reported with the 95\% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity of the included studies was assessed with the I(2) statistic (low 25\%, medium 50\%, high 75\%). Results: Complications occurred within a range of 0 to 72 months in 14.7\% (95\% CI 7.4\% to 27.3\%) of patients with BBC and in 6.3\% (95\% CI 2.5\% to 15.4\%) of patients without BBC. A cumulative incidence could not be assessed. The summary risk difference was 11.1\% (95\% CI -0.1\% to 22.3\%, p=0.052). There was significant heterogeneity (I(2)=85.6\%). The Egger test did not show evidence of publication bias (p=0.975). When specifically considering type Ia endoleak and endograft migration, the risk difference between BBC and non-BBC patients was 8.2\% (95\% CI 0.3\% to 16.1\%, p=0.042; I(2)=69.0\%). The specific risk difference for endograft collapse/infolding and thrombosis was 3.7\% (95\% CI -3.5\% to 11.1\%, p=0.308; I(2)=10.2\%). Conclusion: At present the literature does not provide statistical evidence to establish an overall prognostic value of the BBC. Nevertheless, the BBC appears to be associated with a high risk of type Ia endoleak and endograft migration, which warrants specific and long-term surveillance. Clinically relevant values for BBC grading should be established to perhaps define indications for preemptive treatment based on the presence of BBC only.},

The results of eight original articles published between 1994 and 2016 were evaluated and described. The most common serological method was the enzyme immunoassay. Most of the researchers used validated instruments for behavioral evaluation. Seven studies reported some association between the prevalence of anti-T. gondii antibodies and some altered behavioral aspects in adult humans; these studies focused on adult population in Europe and the USA. The most reported behavioral deviations are related to greater impulsivity and aggressiveness. There are very few studies on this subject, which present some limitations for inference and conclusions: most were cross-sectional studies, with a small sample size and in similar populations.

Studies were identified using a structured search strategy (TS = autophagy AND cornea*) in Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed from inception to September 2019. In this study, 230 articles were collected, of which 28 were analyzed. Mouse models were used in 82\% of the studies, while rat, rabbit, and newt models were used in the other 18\%. The most studied corneal layer was the epithelium, followed by the endothelium and stroma. In 13 articles, genetically modified animal models were used to study Fuch endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), granular corneal dystrophy type 2 (GCD2), dry eye disease (DED), and corneal infection. In other 13 articles, animal models were experimentally induced to mimic DED, keratitis, inflammation, and surgical scenarios. Furthermore, in 50\% of studies, modulators that activated or inhibited autophagy were also investigated.

	abstract = {Both in Europe and worldwide cheese has caused important outbreaks of listeriosis and can be a vehicle for transmission of Listeria monocytogenes to consumers. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using scientific literature and European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reports to summarize available data on the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in different types of cheeses produced in Europe. Meta-analysis models were used to estimate mean prevalence of the pathogen and to compare prevalence among types of cheeses (fresh, ripened, veined, smear and brined) and cheeses produced using, respectively, pasteurized or un-pasteurized milk. Data from a total of 130,604 samples were analysed. Mean prevalence for presence during 2005-2015 estimated from scientific literature (2.3\% with confidence interval (CI): 1.4-3.8\%) was more than three times higher than results from EFSA reports (0.7\%; CI: 0.5-1.1\%). The prevalence differed among types of cheeses including fresh (0.8\%; CI: 0.3-1.9\%), ripened (2.0\%; CI: 0.8-4.9\%), veined (2.4\%; CI: 0.9-6.3\%), smear (5.1\%; CI: 1.9-13.1\%) and brined (11.8\%; CI: 3.5-33.3\%). Mean prevalence of L. monocytogenes in soft/semi-soft cheeses were not significantly different (P {\textgreater}0.05) for cheeses produced from pasteurized (0.9\%; CI: 0.4-1.9\%) or un-pasteurized (1.0\%; CI: 0.4-2.2\%) milk. For cheese samples reported by EFSA 0.2\% CI: 0.1-0.4\% had concentration of L. monocytogenes above the critical European limits of 100 cfu/g. In addition, this systematic review focused on groups/species of microorganisms suitable as indicator organisms for L. monocytogenes in cheeses to reflect the level of production hygiene or as index organisms to assess the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in cheeses. However, no suitable indicator or index organisms were identified. The performed meta-analyses improved our understanding of L. monocytogenes prevalence in different types of cheeses and provided results that can be useful as input for quantitative microbiological risk assessment modelling.},

	abstract = {We performed a systematic review to identify and summarize the effects of distinctive aerobic exercise (AE) protocols on chronic allergic lung inflammation reported in asthma animal models. We identified 255 preclinical studies of asthma and AE protocols by comprehensive searches in PubMed, ScienceDirect and LILACS for peer-reviewed journals, using the search components "exercise," "lung inflammation," and "asthma," without restrictions on publication date. Twenty-two studies were selected that met all eligibility criteria. Most studies used an ovalbumin experimental model and performed experiments with BALB/c mice. Most studies performed treadmill AE, using protocols of 30 to 60 minutes, 3 to 5 times/week, for 4 to 8 weeks. The results showed that the effects of AE on lungs were protocol dependent, but generaly, there was a decrease in inflammatory cell influx and Th2 cytokines, as well as an increase in anti-inflammatory defenses. However, the immunoregulation of globulins and nitric oxide levels in asthma seemed to be associated with the onset of AE. The results suggest that AE plays an important immunoregulatory role in animal models of asthma, with effects mainly mediated by increased anti-inflammatory defenses and reduced Th2 response. In parallel, prophylactic and therapeutic AE also played important roles in decreasing bronchial responsiveness and attenuating lung remodeling in animal models of asthma, secondary outcomes in this systematic review. The review protocol was published for free access in October 2017 on the Systematic Review Facility (SyRF) platform (http://syrf.org.uk/protocols/).},

Twenty-eight articles that fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria established were analysed. Studies suggest there is a specific deficiency of endocannabinoids in the periphery during CINP. Inhibitors of FAAH and MGL, enzymes that degrade the endocannabinoids, CB receptor agonists, desipramine, and coadministered indomethacin plus minocycline were found to either prevent the development and/or attenuate established CINP in a CB receptor-dependent manner. The studies analysed suggest that targeting the endocannabinoid system for prevention and treatment of CINP is a plausible therapeutic option. Almost 90\% of the studies on animal models of CINP analysed utilised male rodents. Taking into consideration clinical and experimental findings that show gender differences in the mechanisms involved in pain including CINP and in response to analgesics, it is imperative that future studies on CINP utilise more female models.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Guidelines regarding the impact and value of prophylaxis or maintenance therapy in equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS) are not well-established or defined. The merits and the magnitude of effects of prophylaxis for spontaneous or recurrent squamous gastric ulceration in horses in training are uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To pool data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to eliminate reporting bias and evaluate the efficacy of prophylactic omeprazole in the prevention of EGUS in training horses, and secondarily to compare prophylactic dosages of omeprazole. STUDY DESIGN: Meta-analysis. METHODS: This meta-analysis was conducted according to the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A systematic literature search identified RCTs comparing omeprazole prophylaxis with sham in prevention of EGUS. Data were analysed using the Mantel-Haenszel test method to calculate risk ratio (RR) or mean difference (MD) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Primary outcome was efficacy of prophylaxis. Secondary outcome was endoscopic severity of ulceration. The influence of study characteristics on the outcomes was examined by subgroup analyses. RESULTS: In preventing gastric ulcer occurrence, omeprazole prophylaxis was superior to sham in training horses (7 trials, 566 horses, RR 0.28, 95\% CI 0.18-0.43; 23.4\% in omeprazole prophylaxis vs. 77.2\% in sham; high quality evidence). Prevalence of ulceration was 75.3 and 87.2\% in the sham arms of the 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg omeprazole groups, respectively. Severity scores were significantly lower for omeprazole vs. sham (mean difference [MD] -1.05; 95\% CI -1.35 to -0.69). Subgroup analyses comparing prophylactic omeprazole dosages resulted in a mean difference of -0.94 and -1.60 for the 1 and 2 mg/kg groups, respectively. MAIN LIMITATIONS: Studies showed heterogeneity with regard to prophylactic dose. CONCLUSIONS: Omeprazole prophylaxis in active training horses significantly reduces gastric ulceration compared with no prophylaxis (sham) with the absolute effect of 566 fewer ulcers per 1000 horses treated.},

METHODS: The search was performed using seven international databases including Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and EMBASE up to 11 October 2018. Random effects model was used to determine the pooled seroprevalence of T. gondii infection with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) and analyzed data from four continents. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were also performed according to continent and gender. RESULTS: In total, 42 studies out of 3517 published articles involving 14,542 camels from 17 countries were included for the final analyses. The global pooled seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in the Camelidae family was 28.16\% (95\% CI 23.64-32.68\%). Besides, the highest seroprevalence rate was in Europe (49.64\%) followed by Africa (37.63\%), America (21.76\%), and Asia (17.58\%). Moreover, the overall seroprevalence rates of T. gondii infection were 22\% (95\% CI 10-33\%) and 15\% (95\% CI 9-22\%) for the females and males, respectively. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis showed a high seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in camelids as these animals play an important role in the transmission cycle of this zoonotic disease.},

	abstract = {Energy metabolism has received much attention as a potential driver of repeatable among-individual differences in behaviour (animal personality). Several factors have been hypothesized to mediate this relationship. We performed a systematic review with a meta-analysis of {\textgreater}70 studies comprised of {\textgreater}8000 individuals reporting relationships between measures of maintenance metabolic rates (i.e. basal metabolic rate, resting metabolic rate, and standard metabolic rate) and behaviour. We evaluated support for three hypothesized mediators: (i) type of behaviour, (ii) opportunities for energy re-allocation, and (iii) magnitude of energetic constraints. Relationships between measures of maintenance metabolic rate (MR) and behaviour are predicted to be strongest for behaviours with strong consequences for energy turnover (acquisition or expenditure). Consistent with this, we found that behaviours with known consequences for energy gain (e.g. foraging, dominance, boldness) or expenditure (e.g. maximum sprint speed, sustained running speed, maximum distance travelled, etc.) had strong positive correlations with MR, while behaviours with putatively weak and/or inconsistent associations with net energy gain or loss (e.g. exploration, activity, sociability) were not correlated with MR. Greater opportunities for energy reallocation are predicted to weaken relationships between MR and behaviour by creating alternative pathways to balance energy budgets. We tested this by contrasting relationships between MR and behaviour in ectotherms versus endotherms, as thermoregulation in endotherms creates additional opportunities for energy reallocation compared with ectotherms. As predicted, the relationship between behaviour and MR was stronger in ectotherms compared with endotherms. However, statistical analyses of heterogeneity among effect sizes from different species did not support energy re-allocation as the main driver of these differences. Finally, we tested whether conditions where animals face greater constraints in meeting their energy budgets (e.g. field versus laboratory, breeding versus non-breeding) increased the strength of the relationship between MR and behaviour. We found that the relationship between MR and behaviour was unaffected by either of these modifiers. This meta-analysis provides two key insights. First, we observed positive relationships of similar magnitude between MR and behaviours that bring in net energy, and behaviours that cost net energy. This result is only consistent with a performance energy-management model. Given that the studies included in our meta-analysis represent a wide range of taxa, this suggests that the performance model may be the most common model in general. Second, we found that behaviours with putatively weak or inconsistent consequences for net energy gain or expenditure (exploration, activity, sociability) show no relationship with MR. The lack of relationship between MR and behavioural traits with weak and/or inconsistent consequences for energy turnover provides the first systematic demonstration of the central importance of the ecological function of traits in mediating relationships between MR and behaviour.},

	abstract = {Reducing meat consumption may improve human health, curb environmental damage, and limit the large-scale suffering of animals raised in factory farms. Most attention to reducing consumption has focused on restructuring environments where foods are chosen or on making health or environmental appeals. However, psychological theory suggests that interventions appealing to animal welfare concerns might operate on distinct, potent pathways. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of these interventions. We searched eight academic databases and extensively searched grey literature. We meta-analyzed 100 studies assessing interventions designed to reduce meat consumption or purchase by mentioning or portraying farm animals, that measured behavioral or self-reported outcomes related to meat consumption, purchase, or related intentions, and that had a control condition. The interventions consistently reduced meat consumption, purchase, or related intentions at least in the short term with meaningfully large effects (meta-analytic mean risk ratio [RR] = 1.22; 95\% CI: [1.13, 1.33]). We estimated that a large majority of population effect sizes (71\%; 95\% CI: [59\%, 80\%]) were stronger than RR = 1.1 and that few were in the unintended direction. Via meta-regression, we identified some specific characteristics of studies and interventions that were associated with effect size. Risk-of-bias assessments identified both methodological strengths and limitations of this literature; however, results did not differ meaningfully in sensitivity analyses retaining only studies at the lowest risk of bias. Evidence of publication bias was not apparent. In conclusion, animal welfare interventions preliminarily appear effective in these typically short-term studies of primarily self-reported outcomes. Future research should use direct behavioral outcomes that minimize the potential for social desirability bias and are measured over long-term follow-up.},

The aim of our study was to update the evidence regarding dairy intake, osteoporotic fracture (OF) risk, and prospective bone mass density (BMD) evolution assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in Europeans and non-Hispanic whites from North America. A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus for papers published from 1 January, 2000 to 30 April, 2018. The eligibility criteria were as follows: healthy adults; measurable dairy exposure; hip, vertebral, wrist or OF as outcomes; and cohort or case-control studies. Two independent investigators conducted the search and the data extraction. A pooled analysis was conducted with random-effects models. Publication bias and meta-regression were considered. Ten cohort studies relating to OF risk were selected for meta-analysis. Three papers reporting BMD changes associated with dairy intake could not be aggregated in the meta-analysis. The pooled HRs of the highest compared with the lowest levels of dairy intake were 0.95 (95\% CI: 0.87, 1.03; I2 = 82.9\%; P-heterogeneity {\textless} 0.001) for OF at any site; 0.87 (95\% CI: 0.75, 1.01; I2 = 86.7\%; P-heterogeneity {\textless} 0.001) for hip fractures; and 0.82 (95\% CI: 0.68, 0.99; I2 = 0.0\%; P-heterogeneity = 0.512) for vertebral fractures. Concerning BMD, the selected studies described a 1.7-3\% lower hip BMD in young and postmenopausal women with poor intake of milk in their youth, a positive relationship between baseline milk ingestion and the percentage of trochanter BMD change in elderly people, and a positive correlation between milk consumption and BMD change at the radius in women aged {\textgreater}65 y. In conclusion, in the studied population, the highest consumption of dairy products did not show a clear association with the total OF or hip fracture risks; however, a diminished risk of vertebral fracture could be described.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Neglected zoonotic diseases (NZDs) have a significant impact on the livelihoods of the world's poorest populations, which often lack access to basic services. Water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes are included among the key strategies for achieving the World Health Organization's 2020 Roadmap for Implementation for control of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). There exists a lack of knowledge regarding the effect of animals on the effectiveness of WASH measures. OBJECTIVES: This review looked to identify how animal presence in the household influences the effectiveness of water, hygiene and sanitation measures for zoonotic disease control in low and middle income countries; to identify gaps of knowledge regarding this topic based on the amount and type of studies looking at this particular interaction. METHODS: Studies from three databases (Medline, Web of Science and Global Health) were screened through various stages. Selected articles were required to show burden of one or more zoonotic diseases, an animal component and a WASH component. Selected articles were analysed. A narrative synthesis was chosen for the review. RESULTS: Only two studies out of 7588 met the inclusion criteria. The studies exemplified how direct or indirect contact between animals and humans within the household can influence the effectiveness of WASH interventions. The analysis also shows the challenges faced by the scientific community to isolate and depict this particular interaction. CONCLUSION: The dearth of studies examining animal-WASH interactions is explained by the difficulties associated with studying environmental interventions and the lack of collaboration between the WASH and Veterinary Public Health research communities. Further tailored research under a holistic One Health approach will be required in order to meet the goals set in the NTDs Roadmap and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.},

However, cancer type, treatment regimen, fatigue and anxiety can influence cognitive status. Rodent research has overcome these confounds to systematically evaluate cognitive domains and underlying neural mechanisms disrupted by chemotherapy treatment. Therefore, a systematic review was conducted in June 2017 to examine the relationship between chemotherapy and cognitive decline in animal models. A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, Scopus and Medline databases. A quality assessment yielded a total of 83 papers to be considered for the review. A critical assessment of research papers indicated that cisplatin, CMF and MTX + 5-FU chemotherapy regimens produced strong deficits in short term memory, long term memory and executive control. An assessment of specific cognitive domains illustrated that short term memory was strongly impaired by chemotherapy treatment, often associated with impaired neurogenesis, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in the hippocampus. Pharmacological treatments were the most common intervention to reduce the prevalence of chemobrain.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The transmission of malaria is known to be sensitive to the survival (longevity, mortality) of its mosquito vector, yet there have been few reviews of estimates of this important population parameter in the malaria-carrying genus Anopheles. METHODS: We carried out a systematic search for and meta-analysis of survival estimates, framed around the methods of estimation, under the major groupings of ‛vertical' (based on stable age or stage frequencies), ‛horizontal' (based on recaptures of marked and released cohorts), and ‛parasitological' (proportion of infectious mosquitoes). Because of the intricacies of the estimation process we provide an outline of these methods. RESULTS: By meta-analysis we quantify the average of the distribution of daily survival [Formula: see text] for vertical (0.83, 95\% CI: 0.80-0.86), horizontal (0.73, 95\% CI: 0.66-0.79) and parasitological (0.92, 95\% CI: 0.86-0.95) methods. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis demonstrates the anticipated result that horizontal estimates are lowest because they estimate apparent survival (survival and non-emigration) rather than true survival. On the other hand, vertical methods make strong assumptions about the stability or stationarity of the underlying populations. Further potential sources of methodological bias are mentioned. The substantial differences in estimates between methods indicates that methodological biases need to be considered when making use of available survival estimates.},

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. ANIMALS: Client-owned or healthy research dogs. METHODS: A literature review was performed by using PubMed and CAB abstracts for English-language studies providing descriptions of complications related to laparoscopic and laparoscopic-assisted procedures in dogs. Study selection used PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Quality assessment was performed by using a MINORS (Methodological Items for Non-Randomized Studies) scoring system and a grading scale of level of evidence. Descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: In total, 741 manuscripts were identified, with 64 manuscripts eligible for data extraction and quality assessment. The most represented organ system was the female genital tract, represented by 22 (34.4\%) studies. The most commonly reported intraoperative and postoperative complications were related to abdominal entry and portal incisions, respectively. In 53 of 54 non-randomized studies, high risk of bias was found. Forty-eight (75\%) studies provided level III or IV evidence. CONCLUSION: This report provides an updated review of complications related to laparoscopic and laparoscopic-assisted procedures in dogs, classified by organ system. The overall quality of evidence was low, limiting direct comparison of complication rates between studies. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: There is a need for implementation of standardized criteria for defining complications, study time frames and greater numbers of high quality prospective randomized trials in veterinary laparoscopy to permit comparison of complication and conversion rates between published studies and across organ systems.},

Importantly, each of the individual post-injury cascades is characterized by complex and potentially opposing pathophysiological responses, complicating optimal resuscitation and therapeutic approaches. Large animal models of poly-neurotrauma closely mimic human physiology, but a systematic literature review of published models has been lacking. The current review suggests a relative paucity of large animal poly-neurotrauma studies (N = 52), with meta-statistics revealing trends for animal species (exclusively swine), characteristics (use of single biological sex, use of juveniles) and TBI models. Although most studies have targeted blood loss volumes of 35-45\%, the associated mortality rates are much lower relative to Class III/IV human trauma. This discrepancy may result from potentially mitigating experimental factors (e.g., mechanical ventilation prior to or during injury, pausing/resuming blood loss based on physiological parameters, administration of small volume fluid resuscitation) that are rarely associated with human trauma, highlighting the need for additional work in this area.},

Grazing swards consisting of herb species grown with either a grass species or a grass and legume (multispecies swards) were compared with non-herb-containing swards consisting of a grass species grown as a monoculture or grass-legume swards (simple swards). A literature search was completed using the online databases CAB Direct, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, using the search strategy "dairy cow", "herb OR forb OR phorb", and "grazing". Milk production data, variance, and sample size were required for eligibility. In all, 116 studies were identified. Following eligibility screening, 11 papers from 6 journals, published between 2006 and 2018, were available for analysis. Studies were from New Zealand (N = 7), Australia (N = 3), and the United States (N = 1). The population was either Holstein Friesian or Holstein Friesian × Jersey dairy cows, with a range in mean daily milk yield (MY) from 12.1 kg to 34.7 kg (mean = 18.6 kg). A total of 25 comparisons were used for milk production analysis, with 324 and 284 cows included in multispecies and simple sward groups respectively. Data analysis was conducted in R using a random effects, robust variance estimation model (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Heterogeneity was reported using the I(2) statistic. Milk production was significantly increased. Analysis of MY resulted in a weighted mean difference (WMD) of +1.20 kg/d (95\% CI = 0.90, 1.49; I(2) = 4\%). Fat and protein kg were also significantly increased (WMD +0.06 kg/d; CI = 0.01, 0.11). Urinary nitrogen excretion was estimated from milk urea nitrogen when reported (n = 6). A WMD of -28.1 g of N/d (95\% CI = -81.1, 24.9) was generated, with heterogeneity high among studies (I(2) = 75\%). This meta-analysis shows the potential benefits of multispecies swards. Although we saw no significant difference in UN excretion, an increase in milk production was found.},

	abstract = {Grazing can have considerable ecological impacts when managed inappropriately, however livestock production is a significant contributor to global food security and the removal of land from production is not always a viable option. Grazing management practices that incorporate periods of planned rest (i.e. strategic-rest grazing) may be an alternative to grazing exclusion or continuous grazing that could achieve ecological and animal production outcomes simultaneously. We conducted a meta-analysis of global literature to investigate how strategic-rest grazing mediates ecological (i.e., plant richness and diversity), biophysical (plant biomass and ground cover) and production response variables (animal weight gain and animal production per hectare) compared to continuously grazed or ungrazed areas. Overall, total ground cover and animal production per hectare were significantly greater under strategic-rest grazing than continuous grazing management, but biomass, plant richness, plant diversity and animal weight gain did not differ between grazing treatments. Increasing the length of rest relative to graze time under strategic-rest grazing was associated with an increase in plant biomass, ground cover, animal weight gain and animal production per hectare when compared to continuous grazing. Synthesis and applications. Understanding both the ecological and animal production trade-offs associated with different grazing management strategies is essential to make informed decisions about best-management practices for the world's grazing lands. We show that incorporating periods of rest into grazing regimes improves ground cover and animal production per hectare and that these benefits are more pronounced with increases in the length of time land is rested for. This extended rest also improves biomass production and weight gain compared to continuous grazing systems. Based on these meta-analyses, we recommend that future research considers the duration of rest compared to graze time in comparisons of grazing systems.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Placenta has a long history of use for treating burns and wounds. It is a rich source of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins, tissue reparative growth factors, and stem cells, including mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Recent data show its therapeutic potential for orthopaedic sports medicine indications. PURPOSE: To provide orthopaedic surgeons with an anatomic description of the placenta, to characterize its cellular composition, and to review the literature reporting the use of placenta-derived cells and placental tissue allografts for orthopaedic sports medicine indications in animal models and in humans. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: Using a total of 63 keyword combinations, the PubMed and MEDLINE databases were searched for published articles describing the use of placental cells and/or tissue for orthopaedic sports medicine indications. Information was collected on placental tissue type, indications, animal model, study design, treatment regimen, safety, and efficacy outcomes. Results were categorized by indication and subcategorized by animal model. RESULTS: Outcomes for 29 animal studies and 6 human studies reporting the use of placenta-derived therapeutics were generally positive; however, the placental tissue source, clinical indication, and administration route were highly variable across these studies. Fourteen animal studies described the use of placental tissue for tendon injuries, 13 studies for osteoarthritis or articular cartilage injuries, 3 for ligament injuries, and 1 for synovitis. Both placenta-derived culture-expanded cells (epithelial cells or MSCs) and placental tissue allografts were used in animal studies. In all human studies, commercial placental allografts were used. Five of 6 human studies examined the treatment of foot and ankle pathological conditions, and 1 studied the treatment of knee osteoarthritis. CONCLUSION: A review of the small number of reported studies revealed a high degree of variability in placental cell types, placental tissue preparation, routes of administration, and treatment regimens, which prohibits making any definitive conclusions. Currently, the clinical use of placenta is limited to only commercial placental tissue allografts, as there are no placenta-derived biological drugs approved for the treatment of orthopaedic sports medicine conditions in the United States. However, this review shows that the application of placental cells or tissue allografts appears to be safe and has potential to improve outcomes for orthopaedic sports medicine indications.},

Five databases and two conference proceedings were searched for relevant literature. Articles published in or after 1990 were eligible for inclusion. Eligible interventions or exposures were restricted to modifiable management practices; however, antimicrobial and teat sealant products were enumerated but not further characterized, as systematic reviews have been published on this topic. Other modifiable management practices were reported in 229 articles. Nutrition (n = 79), which included ration formulation and delivery (n = 44) and vitamin and mineral additives (n = 35), was the most commonly reported practice, followed by vaccines (n = 40) and modification of dry period length (n = 27). Risk of clinical mastitis (CM) was the most commonly reported outcome (n = 151); however, reporting of outcome risk periods varied widely between articles. Cure of existing intramammary infections (IMI) over the dry period (n = 40) and prevention of new IMI over the dry period (n = 54) were most commonly reported with a risk period between calving and 30 d in milk. Future systematic reviews with meta-analyses could target management practices such as nutrition, vaccines, and dry period length to quantify their effects on improving udder health during the dry period and early lactation. However, the variation in reporting of time at risk for CM and other outcomes challenges the ability of future synthesis work to inform management decisions on the basis of efficacy to cure or prevent IMI and CM. Consensus on which core outcomes should be evaluated in mastitis research and the selection of consistent risk periods for specific outcomes in animal trials is imperative.},

To date, there has been no systematic overview of the preclinical evidence exploring manipulation of fundamental biological principles in the treatment of AF. As such, the objective of this study was to establish the effect of biological approaches used in the treatment of AF within large and small animals. We performed a systematic search using predefined terms, which yielded 25 studies. We determined the effect of biological approaches on primary efficacy outcomes and assessed the quality of included studies or possible bias in the treatment of AF. Compared with non-transduced or transduced controls, biological therapies reduced AF inducibility (85\% less AF; odds ratio 0.15; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.07-0.35; P {\textless} .01) and atrial scar burden (6.7\% smaller scars; 95\% CI 4.2-9.2; P {\textless} .01) or increased number of days in sinus rhythm (6.4 more days in sinus rhythm; 95\% CI 5.83-6.97; P {\textless} .01). Similar effects were seen in both large and small animals, while a minor tendency to higher risk of bias was observed in small animal studies. In conclusion, treatment with any biological therapy significantly improved AF in preclinical animal models compared with controls. Although biological therapies target markedly different fundamental mechanisms, we observed a consistent difference in their effect on AF outcomes.},

	abstract = {Separation of calves from cows within hours or days of birth is common on dairy farms. Stakeholders have conflicting perspectives on whether this practice is harmful or beneficial for the animals' welfare and production. Our objective was to critically evaluate the scientific evidence for both acute and long-term effects of early separation versus an extended period of cow-calf contact. The outcomes investigated were the behavior, welfare (excluding physical health), and performance (milk yield and growth, respectively) of dairy cows and calves. Primary research papers were found through targeted Web of Science searches, the reference lists of recent reviews for each topic, and the reference lists of papers identified from these sources. Studies were included if they were published in English, the full text was accessible, and they compared treatments with and without contact between dairy cows and calves for a specified period. Early separation (within 24 h postpartum) was found to reduce acute distress responses of cows and calves. However, longer cow-calf contact typically had positive longer-term effects on calves, promoting more normal social behavior, reducing abnormal behavior, and sometimes reducing responses to stressors. In terms of productivity, allowing cows to nurse calves generally decreased the volume of milk available for sale during the nursing period, but we found no consistent evidence of reduced milk production over a longer period. Allowing a prolonged period of nursing increased calf weight gains during the milk-feeding period. In summary, extended cow-calf contact aggravates the acute distress responses and reduces the amount of saleable milk while the calves are suckling, but it can have positive effects on behaviors relevant to welfare in the longer term and benefit calf growth. The strength of these conclusions is limited, however, given that relatively few studies address most of these effects and that experimental design including timing of contact and observations are often inconsistent across studies. Few studies presented indicators of long-term welfare effects other than abnormal and social behavior of the calves.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review examining the effectiveness of pharmacological management of agitation among individuals with acquired brain injury (ABI). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched for all relevant articles published in English from 1980 to January 2016. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included for analysis all participants had moderate to severe ABI, n ≥ 3, and a pharmacological intervention was provided for the treatment of agitation and its effectiveness was assessed. DATA EXTRACTION: Data extracted included participant demographics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, study design, outcome measure(s), and results. Study quality was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database assessment scale for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A level of evidence was assigned to each intervention using a modified Sackett scale. DATA SYNTHESIS: Among 165 retrieved studies, 19 met inclusion criteria. The included studies consisted of 6 RCTs and 13 observational studies. Antipsychotic medications were studied predominately (n = 6), followed by anticonvulsants (n = 4) and dopaminergic (n = 4), antidepressants (n = 3), and beta-blockers (n = 2). Dopaminergic medications, specifically amantadine, had the highest level of evidence (Level 1a). The antipsychotic lithium carbonate was shown to be effective but was not recommended for use due to high risk of neurotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Studies consistently demonstrated that pharmacological treatment was effective in reducing agitation post ABI; however, there was insufficient information to develop a conclusion due to the limited number of studies and overall weakness of evidence for each individual medication.},

Yet, lack of commonly agreed methodology and heterogeneity of cut-off values published in the literature remain a challenge to the accurate determination and application of humane endpoints. With the aim to synthesize and appraise existing humane endpoint definitions for commonly used physiological parameters, we conducted a systematic review of mouse studies of acute and chronic disease models, which used body weight, temperature and/or sickness scores for endpoint definition. In the second part of the study, we used previously published and unpublished data on weight, temperature and sickness scores from mouse models of sepsis and stroke and applied machine learning algorithms to assess the usefulness of this method for parameter selection and endpoint definition across models. Studies were searched for in two electronic databases (MEDLINE/Pubmed and Embase). Out of 110 retrieved full-text manuscripts, 34 studies were included. We found large intra- and inter-model variance in humane endpoint determination and application due to varying animal models, lack of standardized experimental protocols and heterogeneity of performance metrics (part 1). Machine learning models trained with physiological data and sickness severity score or modified DeSimoni neuroscore identified animals with a high risk of death at an early time point in both mouse models of stroke (male: 93.2\% at 72h post-treatment; female: 93.0\% at 48h post-treatment) and sepsis (96.2\% at 24h post-treatment), thus demonstrating generalizability in endpoint determination across models (part 2).},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Globally, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most diagnosed cancer and the third important cause of cancer-related death. As there are only two targeted drugs for the treatment of advanced HCC-that merely extend survival by a few months-the need for alternative treatments is inevitable. Lycopene, a carotenoid that is known to be most abundant in red tomatoes and tomato-based products, has been investigated for its anticancer activity in various types of cancers including HCC. This review was conducted to evaluate the effects of lycopene on HCC from animal models to pave the way for further clinical studies. METHODS: Electronic databases and search engines including PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar were searched for original records addressing the anticancer effect of lycopene in animal models of HCC. Data were extracted using a format prepared in Microsoft Excel and exported to Stata 15.0 for analyses. A meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model at a 95\% confidence level for the outcome measures: tumor incidence, number, and growth (tumor volume and size). The presence of publication bias between studies was evaluated using Egger's test and funnel plot. The study protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database with reference number: CRD42019159312. RESULTS: The initial database search yields 286 articles, of which 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. The characteristics of the included studies were a bit diversified. The studies involved a total of 644 animals (312 treatment and 332 control groups) and mice shared the majority (488) followed by rats (117) and ferrets (39). The meta-analysis showed that lycopene significantly reduced the incidence [RR 0.8; 95\% CI 0.69, 0.92 (p=0.00); I(2) = 30.4\%, p=0.16; n=11], number [SMD-1.83; 95\% CI -3.10, -0.57 (p=0.01); I(2) = 95.9\%, p=0.00; n=9], and growth [SMD -2.13; 95\% CI -4.20, -0.04 (p=0.04); I(2) = 94.6\%, p=0.00; n=4] of HCC. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of lycopene appears to inhibit the initiation and progression of cancer in animal models of HCC. However, more controlled and thorough preclinical studies are needed to further evaluate its anti-HCC effects and associated molecular mechanisms.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Toxocariasis is a helminthozoonosis caused by the infection of a human host by the larva of Toxocara spp., predominately involving Toxocara canis and Toxocara cati, which are common nematodes in dogs and cats, respectively. Human transmission occurs through contact with animals or by consumption of food contaminated with parasite's eggs. The purpose of this article is to review the current knowledge regarding human neurotoxocariasis. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the existing literature concerning toxocariasis of the nervous system. RESULTS: Clinical spectrum of human toxocariasis varies widely from a subclinical course to significant organ morbidity. Clinical course depends on parasitic load, the migration route of the larvae and host response. Human neurotoxocariasis is a relatively rare entity yet associated with severe sequelae. Manifestations include meningitis (usually eosinophilic), encephalitis, myelitis, cerebellar vasculitis, space-occupying lesion, behavioral abnormalities, and optic neuritis. Even though valid diagnostic criteria are lacking, neurotoxocariasis should be suspected in patients with neurologic symptoms and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis with eosinophilia, positive serology for anti-Toxocara antibodies, in serum and/or CSF, sterile CSF and clinical improvement after antihelminthic treatment. Neurotoxocariasis is treated by benzimidazole components, most frequently albendazole, corticosteroids, or diethylcarbamazine. CONCLUSION: Parasite larvae migrate through tissues and are able to reach the nervous system causing neurotoxocariasis. Its clinical spectrum varies and includes myelitis, meningoencephalitis, brain abscess, and vasculitis. Neurotoxocariasis should always be suspected in patients with neurologic symptoms accompanied by eosinophilia in blood and/or CSF. Early diagnosis and treatment could prevent long-term neurologic impairment.},

Systematic searches for publications were carried out on PubMed and Google Scholar, as well as in certain regional and local journals. From a total of 501 articles initially retrieved concerning T. solium cysticercosis in West African countries, only 120 articles were relevant for this review and therefore finally retained. For pigs, only eight out of sixteen countries of the region have reported porcine cysticercosis. Post-mortem examination of carcasses at slaughterhouses, meat inspection at butcheries or tongue inspection in herds have been the main source of data, but may not entirely reflect actual parasite distribution. For humans, only five out of sixteen countries reported epidemiological data on neurocysticercosis. Most data referred to neurocysticercosis prevalence among epileptic patients or isolated clinical cases. Furthermore, existing data are often old. Overall, T. solium cysticercosis remains largely neglected in West Africa, and its prevalence appears not to be affected by any religion in particular. There is an urgent need to promote and implement health partnerships and programs on this disease in order to collect more data and identify sensitive populations in the countries of the ECOWAS area.},

	abstract = {Previous meta-analyses have associated dairy products with a lower risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Since then, new studies evaluating not only total dairy but also different subtypes have been published in this field. The objective of the present work was to systematically review and meta-analyze the epidemiologic studies regarding the associations between the consumption of total dairy products and subtypes (milk, yogurt, and cheese) and the incidence of MetS. Relevant studies were identified through Medline and Cochrane databases. Eligible studies were prospective cohort studies that examined the association between dairy product consumption and/or different subtypes of dairy and the risk of MetS. Random-effects or fixed-effects models were assigned to calculate the pooled RR estimates with 95\% CIs. From the 2994 identified articles, 12 and 11 studies were included for the qualitative and quantitative synthesis, respectively. After comparing the highest with the lowest categories, total dairy product consumption was inversely associated with the risk of MetS (9 study comparisons; RR: 0.73; 95\% CI: 0.64, 0.83). Low-fat dairy and total yogurt consumption were inversely associated with the risk of MetS (low-fat dairy: 2 study comparisons; RR: 0.77; 95\% CI: 0.65, 0.91; total yogurt consumption: 4 study comparisons; RR: 0.74; 95\% CI: 0.66, 0.82). The linear RR per 1 serving of yogurt/d was 0.77 (95\% CI: 0.60, 1.00). Low-fat yogurt and whole-fat yogurt were inversely associated with the risk of MetS (low-fat yogurt: 2 study comparisons; RR: 0.72; 95\% CI: 0.62, 0.84; whole-fat yogurt: 2 study comparisons; RR: 0.81; 95\% CI: 0.70, 0.94). Total milk consumption was inversely associated with the risk of MetS (6 study comparisons; RR: 0.79; 95\% CI: 0.64, 0.97). Whole-fat dairy consumption was not associated with MetS risk. Our findings suggest that the consumption of total and low-fat dairy products, milk, and yogurt is inversely associated with the risk of MetS.

Data used in the meta-analyses were obtained from twenty papers selected using the following criteria: (a) lambs with (I) and without (NI) GIN; (b) lambs fed ad libitum; (c) LWC data; (d) feed consumption data; and (e) chemical composition of diets. The effect of diet composition (crude protein [CP] and metabolizable energy [ME]) on dry matter intake (DMI), and the effect of composition and nutrient intake (DMI and CP intake [CPI]) and ME intake (MEI) on LWC was evaluated using respective regression analyses. The metabolic cost of worm burden was determined as the difference in CP and ME requirements between NI and I lambs for each adult parasite. The CP and ME cost were evaluated for lambs at two different levels: maintenance level 0 g LWC and 100 g LWC. The worm burden had an impact on the DMI and LWC of lambs (P {\textless} 0.05). The association of CP x infection level was the best predictor of DMI. The association between MEI and infection level were the best predictors of LWC. The metabolic cost of GIN increased to 0.30 mg CP/kg LW(0.75) and 0.0056 kJ ME/kg LW(0.75) for each adult parasite. The metabolic cost was not modified by diet quality (maintenance level 0 g LW/day or 100 g LW/day). In conclusion, GIN has a negative effect on DMI and LWC. The metabolic cost of GIN infection can be covered by supplying the additional requirements for protein and energy in the diet of infected lambs.},

The effect of diet composition and consumption of those same variables (g/kg$^{\textrm{0.75}}$) on LWC (g/kg$^{\textrm{0.75}}$) were also evaluated using respective regression analyses. The metabolic cost of CT consumption was estimated in terms of digestible crude protein (DCP) and ME requirements. The cost was estimated for a diet to sustain maintenance and a diet to supply 100 g/d LWC requirements. No effect was found of CT intake on DMI or LWC (P{\textgreater}0.05). The DMI was best predicted by CP and DMD concentration (g/kg DM), when analyzed as a whole data-set. When analyzed as separate categories for CT and non-CT group was best predicted by ME (MJ/kg DM) (P{\textless}0.05). For the CT+PEG group the DMI was best predicted by NDF (P{\textless}0.05). The LWC was best predicted by DCPI$^{\textrm{2}}$ when analyzed as a whole data-set. The best predictor of LWC was the DCP intake (for the CT data) and the ME intake (for non-CT data and CT+PEG data) (P{\textless}0.05). Although CT intake do not have an effect on DMI and LWC, it was observed that at low dietary CP level increases DCP requirement and hence it does have a metabolic cost associated. The metabolic cost of CT consumption estimated for animals consuming a maintenance diet was 0.33 MJ of ME/kg$^{\textrm{0.75}}$ and 1.04 g of DCP/kg$^{\textrm{0.75}}$ and for animals fed a 100 g LWC diet was 0.13 MJ of ME/kg$^{\textrm{0.75}}$ and 0.87 g DCP/kg$^{\textrm{0.75}}$. Thus, a higher cost for CT intake was found for groups of lambs at low feeding level and the metabolic cost was reduced when lambs were at higher feeding levels.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Streptomycin is used as an epidemiological marker in monitoring programs for antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella serovars and indicates the presence of pentaresistance. However, comprehensive data on streptomycin resistant Salmonella among human, animal, and animal products is lacking in Ethiopia. In this review, we aimed to assess heterogeneity and pooled proportion of Salmonella serovars to streptomycin resistance among human, animal and animal products in Ethiopia. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published literature from Ethiopia. We used the MEDLINE/ PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases to identify genetic and phenotypic data on Salmonella isolates. To determine the heterogeneity and pooled proportion, we used metaprop commands and the random-effects model. Relative and cumulative frequencies were calculated to describe the overall preponderance of streptomycin resistance isolates after arcsine-transformed data. Metan funnel and meta-bias using a begg test were performed to check for publication bias. RESULTS: Overall, we included 1475 Salmonella serovars in this meta-analysis. The pooled proportion of streptomycin resistance was 47\% (95\% CI: 35-60\%). Sub-group analysis by target population showed that the proportion of streptomycin resistance in Salmonella serovars was 54\% (95\% CI: 35-73\%) in animal, 44\% (95\% Cl: 33-59\%) in humans and 39\% (95\% CI: 24-55\%) in animals products. The streptomycin resistant Salmonella serovars were statistically increasing from 0.35(95\% CI: 0.12-0.58) in 2003 to 0.77(95\% CI: 0.64-0.89) in 2018. The level of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Salmonella serovars was 50.1\% in the meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: We found a high level of streptomycin resistance, including multidrug, Salmonella serovars among human, animals, and animal products. This resistance was significantly increasing in the last three decades (1985-2018). The resistance to streptomycin among Salmonella serovars isolated from animals was higher than humans. This mandates the continuous monitoring of streptomycin use and practicing one health approach to preventing further development of resistance in Ethiopia. REGISTRATION: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis after registration of the protocol in PROSPERO (CRD42019135116) following the MOOSE (Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology).},

	abstract = {Obesity before and during pregnancy leads to reduced offspring cardiometabolic health. Here, we systematically reviewed animal experimental evidence of maternal obesity before and during pregnancy and offspring anthropometry and cardiometabolic health. We systematically searched Embase and Medline from inception until January 2018. Eligible publications compared offspring of mothers with obesity to mothers with a normal weight. We performed meta-analyses and subgroup analyses. We also examined methodological quality and publication bias. We screened 2543 publications and included 145 publications (N = 21 048 animals, five species). Essential methodological details were not reported in the majority of studies. We found evidence of publication bias for birth weight. Offspring of mothers with obesity had higher body weight (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.76 [95\% CI 0.60;0.93]), fat percentage (0.99 [0.64;1.35]), systolic blood pressure (1.33 [0.75;1.91]), triglycerides (0.64 [0.42;0.86], total cholesterol (0.46 [0.18;0.73]), glucose level (0.43 [0.24;0.63]), and insulin level (0.81 [0.61;1.02]) than offspring of control mothers, but similar birth weight. Sex, age, or species did not influence the effect of maternal obesity on offspring's cardiometabolic health. Obesity before and during pregnancy reduces offspring cardiometabolic health in animals. Future intervention studies should investigate whether reducing obesity prior to conception could prevent these detrimental programming effects and improve cardiometabolic health of future generations.},

	abstract = {Maternal obesity in pregnancy is associated with neurobehavioral problems in the offspring. Establishing causality has been challenging in existing human studies, due to confounding by genetic and postnatal environment. Animal experiments can improve our understanding of this association. This systematic review examined the effects of maternal obesity in pregnancy on offspring neurobehavior in animal models. We included 26 studies (1047 offspring animals). Meta-analyses showed that offspring of obese mothers displayed higher levels of locomotor activity (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.34 [0.10; 0.58]) and anxiety behavior (SMD 0.47 [0.16; 0.79]) than offspring of lean mothers, but similar memory abilities (SMD -0.06 [-0.52; 0.39]). Meta-analysis of learning abilities was not sensible due to heterogeneity. Although the evidence was heterogeneous and the quality of the included studies generally unclear, this systematic review of animal studies indicates an effect of maternal obesity on increased offspring locomotor activity and anxiety, but not on offspring memory performance. These findings may be important from a public health perspective since obesity is rapidly increasing worldwide, and warrant further research.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the initial defibrillation energy dose that is associated with sustained return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) during paediatric cardiac arrest with ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia. METHODS: A systematic review was performed using four databases (PROSPERO: CRD42016036734). Human studies and animal model studies of pediatric cardiac arrest involving assessment of external defibrillation energy dosing were considered. The primary outcome was sustained ROSC. Survival and defibrillation-induced complications were also evaluated. RESULTS: The search strategy identified 14,471 citations of which 232 manuscripts were reviewed. Ten human and 10 animal model studies met the inclusion criteria. Human studies were prospective (n = 6) or retrospective (n = 4) cohort studies and included between 11 and 266 patients (median = 46 patients). Sustained ROSC rates ranged from 0 to 61\% (n = 7). No studies reported a statistically significant association between the initial defibrillation energy dose and the rate of sustained ROSC (n = 7) or survival (n = 6). Meta-analysis was not considered appropriate due to clinical heterogeneity. Risk of bias was moderate. All animal studies were randomized controlled trials with 8 and 52 (median = 27) piglets. ROSC was frequently achieved (≥85\%) with energy dose ranging from 2 to 7 J/kg (n = 7). The defibrillation threshold varied according to the body weight and appears to be higher in infant. CONCLUSION: Defibrillation energy doses and thresholds varied according to the body weight and trended higher for infants. No definitive association between initial defibrillation doses and the sustained ROSC or survival could be demonstrated. Clinicians should follow local consensus-based guidelines.},

	abstract = {Anisakidae are marine zoonotic nematodes with most commercial fish species as intermediate hosts. Both public health risks and socio-economic problems are attributed to these larvae. Despite these concerns, the occurrence of Anisakidae in commercial fish species in Belgium remains unknown. Therefore, the main objective of this systematic review was to look into studies assessing the prevalence and intensity (level of infection) of Anisakidae in countries importing fish to the Belgian market. The databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Cordis, Google Scholar, Google, African Journals online and Asia Journals online were searched. Main eligibility criteria were: fish species consumed in Belgium; studies conducted in one of the main importing countries; and the availability of prevalence data. From the original 519 identified studies, 83 were included with data from Spain, Germany, Chile, Denmark, Turkey, France, China, England, Belgium, Norway, Iceland, Senegal and Sweden. Overall results show a widespread occurrence of Anisakidae with a high variability in prevalence between fish species and fishing sea. Cod (Gadus morhua) and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), the most consumed fish species in Belgium, have a mean prevalence of 33\% and 5\% respectively. Of all investigated fishing zones, fish caught in the Northeast Atlantic has the highest rate of infection (68\%). Furthermore, higher prevalences were found when looking at the viscera (mean prevalence 59\%) compared to the muscle (29\%) and with superior techniques such as enzymatic digestion or UV press (46\%) compared to candling, the routine method (23\%). Farmed fish were found to be the least infected (2\%) but were still not Anisakidae free. The widespread presence of Anisakidae and the associated food safety implications indicate the need to further investigate the presence of Anisakidae in fish in the Belgian market.},

Two electronic databases, PubMed and Scopus, were searched for relevant publications published from 2001 to 2018 using predetermined keywords. A total of 1,484 papers were initially found.

The pooled seroprevalence was slightly higher in Mediterranean basin countries than other countries and when calculated for samples collected between 2001 and 2009 compared to 2010 to 2018. Differences in study design (e.g. sampling associated with recent outbreaks of WNV) contributed to a high degree of variability among studies. Further studies with harmonized study design and reporting of the results are recommended to better estimate and monitor European seroprevalence of WNV in equids.},

	abstract = {Dietary resistant starch (RS) may have prebiotic properties but its effects on fermentation and the microbial population are inconsistent. This meta-analysis aimed to quantify the relationship between RS type 2 (RS2) and intestinal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and pH as well as certain key bacterial taxa for intestinal health in pigs. From the 24 included articles with sufficient information about the animal, and dietary and physiological measurements published between 2000 and 2017, individual sub-data sets for fermentation metabolites, pH, bacterial abundances and apparent total tract digestibility were built and used to parameterize prediction models on the effect of RS2, accounting for inter- and intra-study variability. In addition, the effect of pig's BW at the start of the experiment and duration of the experimental period on response variables were also evaluated using backward elimination analysis. Dietary RS levels ranged from 0\% to 78.0\% RS, with median and mean RS levels of 28.8\% and 23.0\%, respectively. Negative relationships could be established between dietary RS and pH in the large intestine (P\&lt;0.05), with a stronger effect in the mid and distal colon, and feces (R 2=0.64 to 0.81; P\&lt;0.001). A dietary level of 15\% RS would lower the pH in the proximal, mid-, distal colon and feces by 0.2, 0.6, 0.4 and 0.6 units, respectively. Increasing RS levels, however, did not affect SCFA concentrations in the hindgut, but enhanced the molar proportion of propionate in mid-colon and reduced those of acetate in mid-colon and of butyrate in mid- and distal colon (R 2=0.46 to 0.52; P\&lt;0.05). Backward elimination indicated an age-related decrease in mid-colonic propionate proportion and increase in mid- and distal colonic butyrate proportion (P\&lt;0.05), thereby modulating RS2 effects. In feces, increasing RS levels promoted fecal lactobacilli (R 2=0.46; P\&lt;0.01) and bifidobacteria (R 2=0.57; P\&lt;0.01), whereby the slope showed the need for a minimal RS level of 10\% for a 0.5 log unit-increase in their abundance. Best-fit equations further supported that a longer experimental period increased fecal lactobacilli but decreased fecal bifidobacteria (P\&lt;0.05). In conclusion, dietary RS2 seems to effectively decrease digesta pH throughout the large intestine and increase lactic acid-producing bacteria in feces of pigs which may limit the growth of opportunistic pathogens in the hindgut. To achieve these physiologically relevant changes, dietary RS should surpass 10\% to 15\%.},

	abstract = {Small Ruminant Lentiviruses (SRLV) are highly prevalent retroviruses with significant genetic diversity and antigenic heterogeneity that cause a progressive wasting disease of sheep called Maedi-visna. This work provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of the last 40 years (1981-2020) of scientific publications on SRLV individual and flock prevalence. Fifty-eight publications and 314 studies were included. Most articles used a single diagnostic test to estimate prevalence (77.6\%), whereas articles using three or more tests were scarce (6.9\%). Serological tests are more frequently used than direct methods and ELISA has progressively replaced AGID over the last decades. SRLV infection in sheep is widespread across the world, with Europe showing the highest individual prevalence (40.9\%) and being the geographical area in which most studies have been performed. Africa, Asia, and North America show values between 16.7\% to 21.8\% at the individual level. South and Central America show the lowest individual SRLV prevalence (1.7\%). There was a strong positive correlation between individual and flock prevalence (p = 0.728; p 0.001). Despite the global importance of small ruminants, the coverage of knowledge on SRLV prevalence is patchy and inconsistent. There is a lack of a gold standard method and a defined sampling strategy among countries and continents.},

	abstract = {Rodents represent 42\% of the world's mammalian biodiversity encompassing 2,277 species populating every continent (except Antarctica) and are reservoir hosts for a wide diversity of disease agents. Thus, knowing the identity, diversity, host-pathogen relationships, and geographic distribution of rodent-borne zoonotic pathogens, is essential for predicting and mitigating zoonotic disease outbreaks. Hantaviruses are hosted by numerous rodent reservoirs. However, the diversity of rodents harboring hantaviruses is likely unknown because research is biased toward specific reservoir hosts and viruses. An up-to-date, systematic review covering all known rodent hosts is lacking. Herein, we document gaps in our knowledge of the diversity and distribution of rodent species that host hantaviruses. Of the currently recognized 681 cricetid, 730 murid, 61 nesomyid, and 278 sciurid species, we determined that 11.3, 2.1, 1.6, and 1.1\%, respectively, have known associations with hantaviruses. The diversity of hantaviruses hosted by rodents and their distribution among host species supports a reassessment of the paradigm that each virus is associated with a single-host species. We examine these host-virus associations on a global taxonomic and geographical scale with emphasis on the rodent host diversity and distribution. Previous reviews have been centered on the viruses and not the mammalian hosts. Thus, we provide a perspective not previously addressed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Review of the literature to identify practical, high-fidelity, commercially available animal models for simulation training and surgical skills maintenance in laryngotracheal reconstruction (LTR). METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed and Embase databases was conducted independently by two authors, according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Search terms included "laryngotracheal reconstruction," "laryngotracheoplasty," "pig and larynx," "sheep and larynx," and "rabbit and larynx." Articles were then assessed, identifying model cost and availability, model validation, feasibility as a training tool, and verisimilitude to pediatric LTR. RESULTS: In total, 79 articles were considered suitable for inclusion in the study, incorporating both in vitro and in vivo models. Models utilized included rabbit (n = 69), pig (n = 7), sheep (n = 1), and goat (n = 2). The rabbit model was similar in size to the neonate, but differences in laryngeal anatomy and cartilage texture made graft insertion difficult. The anatomy of the pig, sheep, and goat larynges more closely resembled the pediatric patient, allowing improved grafting, but corresponded more in size to that of an older child. Commercial availability of the pig and sheep was considered greatest, and was reflected in cost. None of the animal models identified in the literature have been validated as a simulation tool. CONCLUSIONS: The rabbit, sheep and pig models seemed to demonstrate the greatest potential for use as advanced pediatric airway surgery simulation models, with the rabbit model being most utilized in the literature. However, as yet there have been no models formally validated as a simulation training tool. Laryngoscope, 129:235-243, 2019.},

This systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to answer the clinical question: "Does obtaining microscopically tumour-free surgical margins reduce risk for local tumour recurrence in canine cutaneous and subcutaneous STS?" A total of 486 citations were screened, 66 of which underwent full-text evaluation, with 10 studies representing 278 STS excisions ultimately included. Cumulatively, 16/164 (9.8\%) of completely excised and 38/114 (33.3\%) of incompletely excised STS recurred. Overall relative risk of 0.396 (95\% confidence interval = 0.248-0.632) was calculated for local recurrence in STS excised with complete margins as compared to STS excised with incomplete margins. Risk of bias was judged to be low for all studies in terms of selection bias and detection bias but high for all studies in terms of performance bias and exclusion bias. The results of the present meta-analysis, coupled with the results of individual previous studies, strongly suggest that microscopically complete surgical margins confer a significantly reduced risk for local tumour recurrence in canine STS. Future studies ideally should adhere to standardized conducting and reporting guidelines to reduce systematic bias.},

	abstract = {Bone lesions are an important public health problem, with high socioeconomic costs. Bone tissue repair is coordinated by an inflammatory dynamic process mediated by osteoprogenitor cells of the periosteum and endosteum, responsible for the formation of a new bone matrix. Studies using antioxidant products from plants for bone lesion treatment have been growing worldwide. We developed a systematic review to compile the results of works with animal models investigating the anti-inflammatory activity of plant extracts in the treatment of bone lesions and analyze the methodological quality of the studies on this subject. Studies were selected in the PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science databases according to the PRISMA statement. The research filters were constructed using three parameters: animal model, bone repair, and plant extracts. 31 full-text articles were recovered from 10 countries. Phytochemical prospecting was reported in 15 studies (48.39\%). The most common secondary metabolites were flavonoids, cited in 32.26\% studies (n = 10). Essential criteria to in vivo animal studies were frequently underreported, suggesting publication bias. The animals treated with plant extracts presented positive results in the osteoblastic proliferation, and consequently, this treatment accelerated osteogenic differentiation and bone callus formation, as well as bone fracture repair. Possibly, these results are associated with antioxidant, regenerative, and anti-inflammatory power of the extracts. The absence or incomplete characterization of the animal models, treatment protocols, and phytochemical and toxicity analyses impairs the internal validity of the evidence, making it difficult to determine the effectiveness and safety of plant-derived products in bone repair.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prosthetic materials for the repair of abdominal wall defects have been studied extensively to improve outcome. A new approach can be the use of a slowly resorbable synthetic mesh, which aims to combine advantages of both synthetic and biological meshes. The objective of this review is to give an overview of the physicochemical characteristics and biomechanical, histological, and macroscopic outcome (recurrence, adhesion formation) of the use of resorbable synthetic meshes, for treatment and prevention of abdominal wall hernias, based on experimental studies. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Only experimental studies were included. Outcome parameters were resorption, degradation, organization of connective tissue, inflammatory response, tensile strength, and amount of adhesion formation. Surgical characteristics were taken into account as well (type of defect, clean versus contaminated model, position mesh, repair of the defect, recurrences). RESULTS: In total, eleven articles were included. Three absorbable synthetic meshes are currently available: GORE BIO-A mesh (Gore), TIGR Matrix Surgical mesh (Novus Scientific), and Phasix mesh (Bard). Two studies concluded that, despite an early transient inflammatory reaction in the first months, remodeling was good in GORE BIO-A, 6-12 mo after augmentation or suture line reinforcement with only minimal to moderate adhesions when used intraperitoneally. The TIGR Matrix Surgical mesh shows only partial remodeling with a persistent foreign body reaction after 1 y. Phasix mesh seems to perform well in extraperitoneal implantation after 1 y in two studies, although the defect was small. Only two studies directly compared two resorbable synthetic meshes under the same circumstances. The latter also included a number of animals where the meshes were used in a contaminated nonhernia model. No hernia recurrences or deaths of animals were described in all studies. CONCLUSIONS: The use of resorbable synthetic meshes in the prevention or treatment of abdominal wall defects in animal experiments with small defects in clean setting seems safe, with no serious complications related to the device during short-term follow-up. However, there is no evidence available that can support the advantages of resorbable synthetic meshes over the use of synthetic or biological meshes, mostly due to lack of good data. More experimental studies are needed, followed by randomized controlled trials and prospective registries in humans with a sufficiently long follow-up period, to reveal the potential advantages in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Ca digestibility and utilisation in growing pigs are not well understood, and are usually neglected in diet formulation. This has implications not only for the accurate determination of its requirements but also for its interactions with other nutrients. A systematic review and meta-analysis (meta-regression) of published trials was carried out to quantify factors affecting Ca absorption and utilisation, and to derive an estimate of Ca endogenous excretion. The analysis was carried out on the data from forty studies, corresponding to 201 treatments performed on 1204 pigs. The results indicated that although Ca absorption and retention (g/kg of body weight per d) increased with increasing Ca intake (P{\textless}0·001), non-phytate-P intake (P{\textless}0·001) and exogenous phytase supplementation (P{\textless}0·001), these values decreased with increasing phytate-P intake (P{\textless}0·05). Interactions between exogenous phytase and Ca intake, indicating reduced efficacy of this enzyme (P{\textless}0·001), and between phytate-P intake and exogenous phytase, counteracting the direct negative effect of phytate-P (P{\textless}0·05) on Ca absorption and retention, were also detected. There were no effects of animal-related characteristics, such as pig genotype in Ca absorption and retention. The large amount of variance explained in Ca absorption (90 \%) and retention (91 \%) supported our choice of independent variables. Endogenous Ca losses obtained via linear regression were 239 mg/kg of DM intake (95 \% CI 114, 364). These outcomes advance the current understanding of Ca digestibility and utilisation, and should contribute towards establishing requirements for digestible Ca. Consequently, pig diets will be more correctly formulated if digestible Ca values are used in estimating requirements for Ca.},

METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline was used in the search for relevant published articles reporting on cysticercosis, taeniosis and trichinellosis in Iran using a number of appropriate key words. The search was conducted through PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, SpringerLink, SCOPUS, WHOLIS, FAO and CDC. Published scientific articles including journals, books and book chapters reporting on cysticercosis, taeniosis and trichinellosis in Iran for the period between 1967 and 2018 were selected. RESULTS: A total of 37 articles met the search criteria and were incorporated in this review. Of these, 10 (27\%) reported on human taeniosis, 15 (40.5\%) on cysticercosis (10 on Taenia saginata and five on Taenia spp. cysticercosis) and 12 (32.5\%) on trichinellosis. T. saginata was implicated in all human taeniosis cases. All Taenia spp. cysticercosis cases were reported among domesticated pigs and wild animals. A case of neurocysticercosis was reported in a male patient at Shohada Hospital in Tehran. Eleven (91.7\%) of the 12 studies reported on trichinellosis among wild animals, while one (8.3\%) study detected anti-Trichinella IgG in 8 (2.2\%) of the 364 at-risk human beings tested. Nevertheless, most of these studies were carried out in northern Iran. CONCLUSION: This review found T. saginata to be the most prevalent and of greater economic and public health significance in Iran. However, T. solium and Trichinella spp. were of little significance to human health. More studies should focus on other regions besides northern Iran.},

The prevalence (antibodies or ribonucleic acid [RNA]) of HEV infection in animals varied widely depending on biological markers of HEV infection measured: 23.4\% (95\% confidence interval; 12.0-37.2) for anti-HEV immunoglobulins G, 13.1\% (3.1-28.3) for anti-HEV immunoglobulins M, and 1.8\% (0.2-4.3) for RNA; with substantial heterogeneity. In subgroup analysis, the immunoglobulins G seroprevalence was higher among pigs 37.8\% (13.9-65.4). The following HEV genotypes were reported in animals: Rat-HEV genotype 1 (rats and horses), HEV-3 (pigs), HEV-7 (dromedaries), and Bat hepeviruses (bats). CONCLUSIONS: We found a high prevalence of HEV infection in animals in Africa and HEV genotypes close to that of humans. Some animals in Africa could be the reservoir of HEV, highlighting the need of molecular epidemiological studies for investigating zoonotic transmission.},

	abstract = {We aimed to review and meta-analyze the inflammatory and oxidative factors following alpha lipoic acid (ALA) and its derivative "andrographolid-lipoic acid-1" (AL-1) in ulcerative colitis (UC). ALA plays an important role in scavenging intracellular radicals and inflammatory elements. AL-1 is found in herbal medicines with potent anti-inflammatory properties. Data were collected from the Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, Evidence-based medicine/clinical trials, and Cochrane library database until 2017, which finally resulted in 22 animal studies (70 rats and 162 mice). The beneficial effects of ALA or AL-1 on the most important parameters of UC were reviewed; also, studies were considered separately in mice and rats. Administration of ALA and AL-1 significantly reduced the tumor necrosis factor-α level compared with the controls, while data were not noteworthy in the meta-analysis (mean differences = -18.57 [95\% CI = -42.65 to 5.51], P = 0.13). In spite of insignificant decrease in meta-analysis outcomes (differences = 6.92 [95\% CI = -39.33 to 53.16], P = 0.77), a significant reduction in myeloperoxidase activity was shown following ALA or AL-1 treatment compared with the controls. Despite significant differences in each study, we had to exclude some studies to homogenize data for meta-analyzing as they showed insignificant results. Interleukin 6, cyclooxygenase-2, glutathione, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, histopathological score, macroscopic and microscopic scores, disease activity index, body weight change, and colon length were also reviewed. Most studies have emphasized on significant positive effects of ALA and AL-1. Comprehensive clinical trials are obligatory to determine the precious position of ALA or AL-1 in the management of UC.},

Six articles related to fascioliasis in Malaysia were included in the final review from 1,932 screened articles and reports. Five studies focused on ruminants, including cattle, buffaloes, sheep and goats in the states of Terengganu and Perak. The most frequent ruminant fascioliasis outbreaks involved cattle and goats, with a prevalence of 82\%-95\% and these outbreaks occurred in Terengganu. Only one study examined the risk of fascioliasis in cattle. In the study, the age and sex of the cattle were important risk-related parameters. The search returned only one documented report of a suspected case of human fascioliasis with an atypical clinical presentation. At present, human fascioliasis in Malaysia remains under-reported and its prevalence remains unknown.

METHODS: Pertinent prospective cohort studies attained using electronic searches through PubMed, and Scopus up to September 25th, 2017. Relative risks (RR) s with corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) of the highest versus the lowest for cohort studies were evaluated using DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models to find combined RRs. We also assessed the dose-response effect of this relationship. RESULTS: A total of 7 studies involving 354 718 participants were met inclusion criteria. The pooled RR of total stroke risk was [RR = 0.92 95\% CI, 0.82, 1.03, I(2) = 19.8\%, P(heterogeneity) = 0.28] for the highest versus lowest categories of poultry intake. Subgroup analysis showed an inverse associations for the US people [RR = 0.86 95\% CI, 0.77, 0.95, I(2) = 0.0\%, P(heterogeneity) = 0.38] and women [RR = 0.83, 95\% CI, 0.72, 0.93, I(2) = 0.0\%, P(heterogeneity) = 0.63]. We did not obtain any significant association in the subtypes of strokes with highest versus lowest poultry intake [Ischemic stroke (RR = 0.91; 95\% CI: 0.79, 1.02, I(2) = 0.0\%, p = 0.93), Hemorrhagic (RR = 0.82; 95\% CI: 0.59, 1.04, I(2) = 20.5\%, P(heterogeneity) = 0.28)]. One serving per week increment in poultry intake was not associated with the risk of stroke (RR: 1.00, 95\% CI: 0.96, 1.03, I(2) = 69.0\%, P(heterogeneity) = 0.004). Nonlinear dose-response meta-analysis showed lower risk of stroke at consumption ∼1 serving/week. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis revealed that poultry intake is not associated with total stroke risk; furthermore, an inverse relationship in US population and females must be interpreted with caution.},

We used a random effects meta-analysis model to generate the pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Fifteen studies, including eight studies with a case-control design (735 patients and 1342 controls) and seven studies with a cross-sectional design (a total of 4804 participants, 1302 individuals with ASDs and 3502 without ASDs), were included in the meta-analysis. We found an increased risk for ASDs in individuals with Toxocara seropositivity (OR 1.75 [95\% CI 1.16 to 2.64]). Subanalysis showed that Toxocara seropositivity was significantly associated with urticaria (OR 2.97 [95\% CI 1.53 to 5.76]), however, it was not significantly associated with atopy (OR 1.08 [95\% CI 0.55 to 2.15]) and eczema (OR 1.62 [95\% CI 0.95 to 2.78]).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the fact that pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have significantly reduced the rate of invasive pneumococcal diseases through the use of vaccine serotypes, infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a major public health hazard. Serotype-independent vaccines that are economically viable species of common protein antigens such as whole-cell vaccines (WCVs) are needed. Considering the ongoing debate about the effectiveness of WCVs, a systematic literature review and meta-analysis was carried out to determine the efficacy of WCVs against colonization in mice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review was undertaken of published studies on the protection (colonized/uncolonized) of whole cell pneumococcal vaccine in mice. The search terms used were "whole cell vaccine" and "Streptococcus pneumoniae" in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase, Web of Science and Scopus engines. Data was extracted from original publications and a meta-analysis was performed on studies divided into sub-groups by the number of inoculations, type of sample, type of adjuvant, time of sampling, design of study and quality of study. RESULTS: Ten eligible articles published from 2000 to 2016 were included in this review. The meta-analysis was performed on eight out of 10 studies and demonstrated that the estimated pooled risk ratios (RRs) for comparison of colonization between the vaccinated and unvaccinated mice for outcomes 1 and 2 were 0.18 and 0.24, respectively. Lower RRs were observed in sub-groups that were inoculated with vaccines three times, those using cholera toxin (CT) adjuvants and those obtained as tracheal specimens from the mice. CONCLUSIONS: The best protocol for use of a WCV is its application with CT adjuvant administered intranasally in three inoculations at doses of 10⁸ CFU. Further studies performed under similar conditions to obtain accurate results on the effectiveness of this vaccine are recommended.},

Human toxoplasmosis seroprevalence in Malaysia has increased since it was first reported in 1973 as shown in previous reviews of 1991 and 2007. However, over a decade since the last review, comprehensive data on toxoplasmosis in Malaysia is lacking. This work aimed at reviewing articles on toxoplasmosis research in Malaysia in order to identify the research gaps, create public awareness, and efforts made so far and proffer management options on the disease. The present review examines the available published research articles from 2008 to 2018 related to toxoplasmosis research conducted in Malaysia. The articles reviewed were retrieved from nine credible databases such as Web of Science, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Scopus, Springer, Wiley online library, Ovid, and Cochrane using the keywords; Malaysia, toxoplasmosis, Toxoplasma gondii, toxoplasma encephalitis, seroprevalence, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients, pregnant women, genotype strain, anti-toxoplasma antibodies, felines, and vaccine. The data highlighted seropositive cases from healthy community members in Pangkor Island (59.7\%) and among migrant workers (57.4\%) at alarming rates, as well as 42.5\% in pregnant women. Data on animal seroprevalence were limited and there was no information on cats as the definitive host. Genetic characterization of Toxoplasma gondii from HIV patients; pregnant women, and domestic cats is lacking. This present review on toxoplasmosis is beneficial to researchers, health workers, animal health professionals, and policymakers. Therefore, attention is required to educate and enlighten health workers and the general public about the risk factors associated with T. gondii infection in Malaysia.},

The ease of access to maggot therapy has made it increasingly attractive for implementation. This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of maggot therapy as compared to hydrogel dressings in the healing of chronic wounds. METHODS: An electronic literature search until October 2019 was performed using Medline, Embase, and Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature. The eligibility criteria were chronic wound patients with an intervention that involved a comparison of any maggot species with hydrogel dressings. RESULTS: The full text of five studies, involving 580 patients with chronic wounds, was retrieved. Four studies used the Lucilia sericata species. The maggot therapy facilitated faster and more effective debridement of non-viable tissue. It enabled faster development of granulation tissue and increased reduction in the wound surface area compared to hydrogel dressings. Maggot therapy had no effect on disinfection or complete healing rate for the wound. CONCLUSION: Maggot therapy should be considered for faster wound debridement, granulation tissue development, and wound surface area reduction as well as in surgical contraindications. This review can be used as a guide to assist clinicians in identifying patients who may benefit from maggot therapy.},

The objective of this study was to review the spatial distribution of canine VL (CVL) caused by Leishmania infantum in domestic and wild canines in different geographical areas of Iran. An extensive literature search was conducted in different international and national databases, including Cochrane, MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Iran Medex to find articles with the words "visceral leishmaniasis in Iran" in their titles and "canine visceral leishmaniasis in Iran" or "feline visceral leishmaniasis in Iran" or "accidental reservoir hosts of visceral leishmaniasis in Iran" in their subtitles, irrespective of the type and duration of study. Screening of the irrelevant articles from total 36,342, yielded 61 eligible articles. More than 93\% of the studies were carried out on domestic dogs (Canis familiaris, n = 57) and the remaining were on other carnivores such as wild canines including foxes (Vulpes vulpes, n = 4), jackals (C. aureus, n = 6) and wolves (C. lupus, n = 6); while studies on domestic cats (Felis catus, n = 3) as well as desert rodents (n = 2) were rare. The average rate of L. infantum infections reported among domestic dogs using direct agglutination test (DAT) in Iran was 12.5\%. The highest prevalence rate (14\%) was reported from the northwest regions of the country where VL is endemic. The review indicates that CVL is endemic in various parts of Iran and domestic dogs are the main and potential reservoir hosts of the disease. Other carnivores, such as domestic cats and some species of desert rodents (Cricetulus migratorius, Mesocricetus auratus and Meriones persicus) seem to be playing a role in the maintenance of transmission cycle of L. infantum in the endemic areas of the disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment of acute trauma coagulopathy has shifted toward rapid replacement of coagulation factors with frozen plasma (FP). There are logistic difficulties in providing FP. Freeze-dried plasma (FDP) may have logistical advantages including easier storage and rapid preparation time. This review assesses the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of FDP in trauma. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Studies were searched from Medline, Embase, Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Scholar. Observational and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing FDP use in trauma were included. Trauma animal models addressing FDP use were also included. Bias was assessed using validated tools. Primary outcome was efficacy, and secondary outcomes were feasibility and safety. Meta-analyses were conducted using random-effect models. Evidence was graded using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation profile. RESULTS: Twelve human studies (RCT, 1; observational, 11) and 15 animal studies were included. Overall, studies demonstrated moderate risk of bias. Data from two studies (n = 119) were combined for meta-analyses for mortality and transfusion of allogeneic blood products (ABPs). For both outcomes, no difference was identified. For mortality, pooled odds ratio was 0.66 (95\% confidence interval, 0.29-1.49), with I2 = 0\%. Use of FDP is feasible, and no adverse events were reported. Animal data suggest similar results for coagulation and anti-inflammatory profiles for FP and FDP. CONCLUSION: Human data assessing FDP use in trauma report no difference in mortality and transfusion of ABPs in patients receiving FDP compared with FP. Data from animal trauma studies report no difference in coagulation factor and anti-inflammatory profiles between FP and FDP. Results should be interpreted with caution because most studies were observational and have heterogeneous population (military and civilian trauma) and a moderate risk of bias. Well-designed prospective observational studies or, preferentially, RCTs are warranted to answer FDP's effect on laboratory (coagulation factor levels), transfusion (number of ABPs), and clinical outcomes (organ dysfunction, length of stay, and mortality).

	abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus, one of the main contagious mastitis pathogens worldwide, is characterized for causing chronic intramammary infections that respond poorly to antimicrobial therapy, disseminating within the herd leading to high economic losses. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of phenotypic resistance to antimicrobial agents among S. aureus collected worldwide in the context of bovine intramammary infections between the years 1969-2020. A systematic review was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). One hundred and fifty-five articles were eligible for quantitative review. Most of studies included in this meta-analysis were from Europe (88), followed by Asia (56), Latin America (39), Africa (32), North America (26), and Oceania (8). The highest overall prevalence of resistant S. aureus was against penicillin (pestimate 0.451, CI95 \% 0.415-0.487), followed by clindamycin, erythromycin, and gentamycin (p-estimate = 0.149, 0.085, and 0.069, respectively). Ceftiofur and cephalotin presented the lowest overall prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR, p-estimate = 0.020 and 0.015, respectively). The AMR to almost all the antimicrobials evaluated presented an increasing pattern over time, more apparent from 2009 onwards. The antimicrobials with a higher increase in their AMR prevalence over time were clindamycin, gentamycin, and oxacillin. Africa, Asia and Latin America were the continents with higher AMR to most compounds included in this study. No differences in AMR were detected regarding the clinical origin of the isolates (subclinical vs clinical mastitis) for almost all antibiotics evaluated. Differences in the method for testing AMR (disc diffusion method vs minimum inhibitory concentration) and type of study design for monitoring AMR were detected underscoring the importance of these variables as critical factors to enable comparisons for evaluating emergence of AMR.},

All English language studies of longitudinal design, and works cited within them, found in six literature databases, were considered, and their quality assessed. Of 65 articles appraised, 44 studies were selected. Results were organized by timing of assessments, injury severity, and cognitive domains assessed. Differences in the course of cognitive performance were observed across injury severity groups and cognitive domains, with differential proportions of reports of improvement, decline, or no change over time. The evidence for genetic, sex-, age-, and injury-related factors as determinants of cognitive outcome was inconsistent. The non-uniform trajectory of cognitive performance post-TBI supports the notion that this construct is non-homogeneous, and that different factors influence its course. Agreement on a core set of predictors and consideration of psychometric properties of outcome measures is needed.},

	abstract = {Environmental enrichment promotes sensory and motor stimulation for species-typical behaviors, which in turn enhance animal well-being. For farmed Galliformes, housing systems often limit enrichment to bedding and litter, that simultaneously act as material for dustbathing and foraging. Therefore, this meta-analysis sought to systematically review and synthesize the substrate preference test literature for Galliformes. Data based on the following four welfare-related behaviors were extracted for analysis: (1) dustbathing, (2) foraging, (3) pecking, and (4) time spent on a given substrate. Literature searches in CAB Direct, Web of Science, and Google Scholar yielded 239 articles, and hand searching yielded an additional five articles. Ten publications that used different chicken strains as test subjects, met the criteria to be included in the systematic review. The effects of bedding type, the number of days birds had access to tested substrates, enclosure area, and substrate area, on the examined behaviors were determined. We found that birds preferred dustbathing in sand and peat moss more than on any other substrates. The bedding type, size of the enclosure, and size of the substrate area affected the amount of time that birds spent on the tested substrates. When provided the choice between bedding materials, birds spent more time on sand or peat moss than on any other substrate or on no substrate. Notably, most studies did not report relevant physical or chemical characteristics of substrate that may influence birds' preferences, such as grain size, moisture content and the level of soiling. Focusing future studies on identifying substrate characteristics that influence preferences can lead to the discovery of new, practical, enriching beddings that can be easily implemented in housing systems for Galliformes.},

	abstract = {Efforts to control and eliminate human schistosomiasis have accelerated over the past decade. In a number of endemic countries and settings, interruption of schistosome transmission has been achieved. In others, Schistosoma infections continue to challenge program managers at different levels, from the complexity of the transmission cycle, over limited treatment options and lack of field-friendly accurate diagnostics, to controversy around adequate intervention strategies. We conducted a landscape analysis on parasitic and vector-borne disease elimination approaches with the aim to identify evidence-based strategies, core components and key concepts for achieving and sustaining schistosomiasis control and for progressing elimination efforts towards interruption of transmission in sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 118 relevant publications were identified from Web of Science, Pubmed and the grey literature and reviewed for their content. In addition, we conducted in-depth interviews with 23 epidemiologists, program managers, policymakers, donors and field researchers. Available evidence emphasizes the need for comprehensive, multipronged and long-term strategies consisting of multiple complementary interventions that must be sustained over time by political commitment and adequate funding in order to reach interruption of transmission. Based on the findings of this landscape analysis, we propose a comprehensive set of intervention strategies for schistosomiasis control and elimination. Before deployment, the proposed interventions will require review, evaluation and validation in the frame of an expert consultation as a step towards adaptation to specific contexts, conditions and settings. Field testing to ensure local relevance and effectiveness is paramount given the diversity of socio-ecological and epidemiological contexts.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12936-019-2638-9},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Malaria cases and deaths decreased dramatically in recent years, largely due to effective vector control interventions. Persistence of transmission after good coverage has been achieved with high-quality vector control interventions, namely insecticide-treated nets or indoor residual spraying, poses a significant challenge to malaria elimination efforts. To understand when and where remaining transmission is occurring, it is necessary to look at vector and human behaviour, and where they overlap. To date, a review of human behaviour related to residual malaria transmission has not been conducted. METHODS: Studies were identified through PubMed and Google Scholar. Hand searches were conducted for all references cited in articles identified through the initial search. The review was limited to English language articles published between 2000 and 2017. Publications with primary data from a malaria endemic setting in sub-Saharan Africa and a description of night time human behaviours were included. RESULTS: Twenty-six publications were identified that met inclusion criteria. Study results fit into two broad categories: when and where people are exposed to malaria vectors and what people are doing at night that may increase their contact with malaria vectors. Among studies that quantified human-vector interaction, a majority of exposure occurred indoors during sleeping hours for unprotected individuals, with some variation across time, contexts, and vector species. Common night time activities across settings included household chores and entertainment during evening hours, as well as livelihood and large-scale socio-cultural events that can last throughout the night. Shifting sleeping patterns associated with travel, visitors, illness, farming practices, and outdoor sleeping, which can impact exposure and use of prevention measures, were described in some locations. CONCLUSIONS: While the importance of understanding human-vector interaction is well-established, relatively few studies have included human behaviour when measuring exposure to malaria vectors. Broader application of a standardized approach to measuring human-vector interaction could provide critical information on exposure across settings and over time. In-depth understanding of night time activities that occur during times when malaria vectors are active and barriers to prevention practices in different contexts should also be considered. This information is essential for targeting existing interventions and development and deployment of appropriate complementary prevention tools.},

Twenty-four trials met inclusion criteria for systematic review, while fifteen studies were included in the meta-analysis. Results showed no significant differences in the outcomes between PRP and control groups. Finally, there is no definitive evidence that PRP enhances tendons and ligaments healing.

A total of 55 papers published from 1987 to 2017 were eligible for inclusion in this systematic review.

Also, FR235222, QUI-11, tanshinone IIA, and hydroxyzine were shown to be effective against Toxoplasma cysts, but their effectiveness in vivo remains unknown. Additionally, compound 32, endochin-like quinolones, miltefosine, and guanabenz can be used as effective antiparasitic with the unique ability to reduce brain tissue cysts in chronically infected mice. Importantly, these antimicrobial agents are significant criteria for drug candidates. Future studies should focus on the biology and drug susceptibility of the cyst form of T. gondii in chronic toxoplasmosis patients to find more effective strategies that have sterilizing activity for eliminating T. gondii tissue cysts from the host, preventing disease relapse and potentially shortening the required duration of drug administration.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the global prevalence of T. gondii in species of the family Felidae. METHODS: We searched seven databases (PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Proquest and Web of Science) for studies reporting seroprevalence of T. gondii in felids from 1967 to 31 December 2017. A total of 217 published papers, containing 223 datasets were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis, comprised 59,517 domestic and 2733 wild cats from 1967 to 2017. RESULTS: The pooled global T. gondii seroprevalence was estimated to be 35\% (95\% CI: 32-38\%) and 59\% (95\% CI: 56-63\%) in domestic cats and wild felids, respectively, using random effects model. The seroprevalence was higher in Australia and Africa where the T. gondii seropositivity in domestic cats was 52\% (95\% CI: 15-89\%) and 51\% (95\% CI: 20-81\%), respectively. The lowest seroprevalence was estimated in Asia 27\% (95\% CI: 24-30\%). The seroprevalence values for T. gondii in wild felids were 74\% (95\% CI: 62-83\%) in Africa, 67\% (95\% CI: 23-111\%) in Asia, 67\% (95\% CI: 58-75\%) in Europe and 66\% (95\% CI: 41-91\%) in South America.

	abstract = {Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a psychophysical test used to quantify somatosensory sensation under normal or pathological conditions including osteoarthritis (OA). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies using QST in healthy and osteoarthritic cats, registered at Systematic Review Research Facility (\#26-06-2017). DESIGN: Hierarchical models with random intercepts for each individual study extracted through the systematic review were fit to subject-level data; QST measures were contrasted between healthy and osteoarthritic cats. Four bibliographic databases were searched; quality and risk of bias assessment were performed using pre-established criteria. RESULTS: Six articles were included; most were of high quality and low risk of bias. Punctate tactile threshold (n = 70) and mechanical temporal summation (n = 35) were eligible for analysis. Cats with OA have lower punctate tactile threshold [mean difference (95\%HDI): -44 (-60; -26) grams] and facilitated temporal summation of pain [hazard ratio (95\%HDI): 5.32 (2.19; 14) times] when compared with healthy cats. The effect of sex and body weight on sensory sensitivity remained inconclusive throughout all analyses. Due to the correlation between age and OA status, it remains difficult to assess the effect of OA on sensory sensitivity, independently of age. CONCLUSIONS: Clear and transparent reporting using guidelines are warranted. Similar to people, centralized sensitization is a feature of OA in cats. Future studies should try to elucidate the age effect on feline OA. Research with natural OA in cats is promising with potential to benefit feline health and welfare, and improve translatability to clinical research.},

The aim of this study was 2-fold: 1) to compile and summarize the evidence of animal studies that compare different forms to induce, treat (disease already established), or prevent (after trauma) TMJA; and 2) to address the following focused question: what is the quality of reporting in these studies? MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted. Animal studies conducted up to October 2019 comparing at least 2 procedures to induce, treat (disease already established), or prevent (after trauma) TMJA were considered. Compliance with the Animal Research Reporting In Vivo Experiments guidelines was checked for all studies. Studies evaluating treatment of TMJA or preventive measures also were evaluated using the SYstematic Review Center for Laboratory animal Experimentation's risk of bias tool for animal studies. RESULTS: A total of 24 studies were included. The studies were evaluated for feasibility regarding data synthesis, and a meta-analysis was not suitable because of methodological differences, mainly regarding the animal model chosen and surgical procedures performed to induce TMJA. In 17 articles, authors aimed to investigate different procedures to induce TMJA (fibrous, fibro-osseous, or bony). In 7 articles, different treatment or preventive strategies were compared. The sheep was the most used animal in models of TMJA. Only 25\% (6 of 24) of studies reported some step to minimize bias (ie, blinding of investigators, randomization procedures, or allocation concealment). Approximately 54\% (13 of 24) of articles clearly commented on study limitations and potential sources of bias. Further animal studies on TMJA should consider improving their reporting standards to increase their validity and improve the reproducibility of animal experiments.},

	abstract = {Housefly (Musca domestica) is an excellent candidate for the distribution of susceptible and resistant bacterial strains that potentially threaten public health. To date, there is a paucity of information on the global distribution of pathogenic bacteria of medical and veterinary importance from diverse environmental settings. Therefore, this study was undertaken to conduct a systemic review and meta-analysis to estimate occurrence of various bacterial species of medical and veterinary importance harboured by houseflies around the world. Published articles from 1980 to 2020 were retrieved from electronic databases and assessed for eligibility according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Seventy-eight studies were included in the review with only 44 studies being eligible for meta-analysis. Results indicated that eligible studies used in this review were from four continents, i.e., Asia (47.4\%) America (23.1\%), Africa (20.5\%) and Europe (8.9\%). The majority of the studies (56.4\%) used the culture method for the identification of bacterial pathogens, while 30.7\% used both culture and PCR techniques. For meta-analysis, we focused on five pathogenic bacterial species including Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. High heterogeneity was found among studies investigating different pathogens including E. coli (Q = 10,739.55; I(2)  = 99.60; Q-p 0.0001), E. faecium (Q = 317.61; I(2)  = 86.46; Q-p {\textless} 0.0001), K. pneumonia (Q = 1,576.61; I(2)  = 97.27; Q-p {\textless} 0.0001), S. aureus (Q = 2,439.12; I(2)  = 98.24; Q-p {\textless} 0.0001) and P. aeruginosa (Q = 1,283.0; I(2)  = 96.65; Q-p {\textless} 0.0001). Furthermore, it was observed that houseflies carried a considerable number of susceptible and antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains that pose considerable threats to public health. Findings from this study have provided more insight on the vectoral potential of houseflies in the transmission of significant bacterial pathogens from different regions across the world. Further investigation is required to quantify the bacterial contamination and dissemination by houseflies.},

	abstract = {Depression is currently treated by pharmacotherapies that can elicit debilitating side effects for patients. Novel treatment options with limited side effects are currently being researched. Resveratrol is a polyphenol and phytoalexin found in the skins of grapes, red wine, Japanese knotweed, and peanuts. It has been studied extensively for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Resveratrol has also gained attention for its neuroprotective properties. The aim of the review was to examine the mechanisms by which resveratrol reduces depressive behaviors in animal models. In total, 22 studies met the established criteria for final review. Behavioral aspects of depression were investigated using validated measures such as the forced swimming test, tail suspension test, sucrose preference test, and open field test. While many physical measures were taken, three main biological mechanisms were explored: Regulation of the hypothalamic⁻pituitary⁻adrenal axis; decreased inflammation; and increased Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor and neurogenesis. Based on these findings, resveratrol may be deemed an effective treatment for depression in animal models at doses between 10⁻80 mg/kg/day, although higher doses had the most significant effects. Future studies should examine the effects of resveratrol on depression in humans to determine the eligibility of resveratrol as a natural antidepressant with less severe side effects.},

Furthermore, 42 studies reported a significant improvement in gut microbiota (GM), significantly affecting the genera Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Blautia, Roseburia, Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus, Alistipes, and Desulfovibrio. Polyphenols' anti-obesity, anti-hyperglycaemic, and anti-inflammatory properties were associated with their ability to modulate GM.

	abstract = {Diabetes, as a low-grade chronic inflammatory disease, causes disruption in proper function of immune and metabolic system. Chromium is an important element required for normal lipid and glucose metabolism. Chromium deficiency is correlated with elevation in cardiometabolic risk, which results from increased inflammation. This systematic review was conducted to discover the potential roles of chromium on inflammatory biomarkers. Eligible studies were all in vitro, animal and human studies published in English-language journals from inception until October 2018. PubMed, Scopus, Embase, ProQuest and Google Scholar databases were searched to fined interventional studies from the effects of chromium on inflammatory biomarkers such as tumour necrosis factor a (TNF -a), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukins, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP -1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM -1) and adipocytokines in hyperglycaemia and diabetes. Out of 647 articles found in the search, only 14 articles were eligible for analysis, three in vitro studies, eight animal studies and three human studies. Twelve of the 14 studies included in this review, chromium significantly decreased inflammatory factors. The findings of this review indicate, based on in vitro and in vivo studies, that chromium might have potential anti-inflammatory properties, but some of the studies did not show anti-inflammatory effects for chromium (two studies). There are only three studies in humans with controversial results. Therefore, more consistent randomized double-blind controlled trials are needed to reach relevant clinical recommendations, as well as to determine the precise mechanism, of chromium on inflammation in diabetes.},

	abstract = {Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) during pregnancy has been associated with childhood obesity. Research in which rodent dams have been given high-fat/high-sugar diets has consistently found metabolic alterations in their offspring. However, what remains unclear is the potential impact on the developing fetus of giving sugar in isolation at concentrations similar to SSBs to the mothers. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (Protocol No: 127115 on Prospero) to identify potential relationships between maternal sucrose consumption and metabolic outcomes in offspring of rodent (rat or mouse) models. We analysed studies that provided rodent mothers dams with access to sucrose solutions (8-20\% w/v) prior to conception, during pregnancy and/or lactation and that reported offspring outcomes of body weight (BW), body composition and glycaemic control. Following a systematic search of four databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Scopus) performed on 15 January 2019, maternal and offspring data from 15 papers were identified for inclusion. Only rat studies were identified. Meta-analyses were performed on standardised mean differences for maternal and offspring BW and fasting glucose levels, with subgroup analyses of strain, sucrose concentration, exposure period and sex of offspring. A bias towards the inclusion of only data from male offspring was identified and this limited interpretation of potential sexually dimorphic outcomes. Maternal sucrose exposure was associated with an increased risk of obesity and poor glucose disposal in adult and aged offspring.},

	abstract = {Little is known about possible effects of maternal non-nutritive sweetener (NNS) consumption on the metabolic health of a child. Animal models of maternal NNS consumption during pregnancy or weaning have yielded widely varying results, and there appears to be no clear consensus on the consequences for offspring body weight, glycaemic control or sweet preference choices. Moreover, heterogeneity in study design has hampered a clear focus for future research relevant to human health. In an effort to bring clarity, we have conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (protocol no: CRD42018109509) in animal models (rat or mouse) of maternal NNS feeding (compared to water or basal diet) during pre-gestation, pregnancy or lactation. Four databases were searched from inception to 15th September 2018: PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS and Web of Science. We present maternal and offspring data from 24 included studies, which have been quantitatively analysed after study quality assessment, to identify relationships between maternal diet and offspring body weight (BW), feeding behaviour and glycaemic control. In 11 data sets, exposure to NNS reduced maternal BW during pregnancy, with no effect on litter outcomes. Meta-analyses on offspring BW during weaning (1123 offspring) and adulthood (646 offspring) identified small decreases in BW for both sexes. Subgroup analyses revealed reductions in BW of rat, but not mouse models. High dosage appears to be a potential factor for reduced palatability that could influence BW results; however, a lack of reported data limited our ability to confirm. Despite this, and the fact many papers were predisposed to bias, the balance of evidence suggests a maternal NNS diet during pregnancy or lactation did not increase the body weight in offspring.},

	abstract = {Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease caused by helminths of the genus Schistosoma with two presentations; one intestinal and another urinary; which depend on the specie of Schistosoma. One of the species that can produce intestinal schistosomiasis is Schistosoma mansoni, and the specie that produces urinary schistosomiasis is Schistosoma haematobium. Infection can be aggravated by a deficient nutritional status, which negatively impacts the immune system and increases susceptibility to infection. The main objective of this meta-analysis is to determine if a relationship exists between multimicronutrient supplementation and the reduction of infestation with Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium in children and adolescents. A search was conducted through a scientific literature database, and articles that complied with the pre-established requirements were retrieved. The Review Manager (Rev Man) 5.3 computer program was used for data processing and analysis was carried out with the objective of testing whether the addition of micronutrient supplementation to treatment with broad-spectrum antiparasitic anthelmintic medication has an impact on schistosomiasis infection. Of the 257 initial articles retrieved, eight were included both quantitatively and qualitatively in the meta-analysis. Supplementation reduces infestation with Schistosoma spp 1.33 times more than placebo. In individuals infested with Schistosoma, mansoni supplementation is 1.30 times more effective than placebo and for individuals infested with Schistosoma haematobium, supplementation is 1.62 times more effective than the placebo. The results show a clear relationship between supplementation and reduction of infestation. The supplementation with micronutrients decreases the presence of Schistosoma spp in children and adolescents.},

	abstract = {Listeriosis is a rare but severe foodborne illness which is more common in populations such as pregnant women, and can result in serious complications including miscarriage, prematurity, maternal and neonatal sepsis, and death in the newborn. Population recommendations exist for specific foods and food preparation practices to reduce listeriosis risk during pregnancy. The aim of the present systematic review was to assess the association between listeriosis and these practices during pregnancy to confirm appropriateness of these recommendations. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL Plus, Web of Science Core Collection, included articles' references, and contacted clinical experts. All databases were searched until July 2017. Case-control and cohort studies were included which assessed pregnant women or their newborn offspring with known listeriosis status and a nutritional exposure consistent with international population recommendations for minimising listeriosis. Outcomes included listeriosis with or without pregnancy outcomes. Risk of bias was assessed through the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results were described narratively due to clinical heterogeneity in differences in nutritional exposures. Eleven articles comprising case-control or cross-sectional studies met the inclusion criteria. Cases of maternal, fetal or neonate listeriosis were more likely to have consumed high-risk dairy products, meat products or some fruits during pregnancy in comparison with women without listeriosis. Cases of listeriosis were more likely to have consumed foods that are highlighted in population guidelines to avoid to minimise listeriosis in comparison with those without listeriosis during pregnancy. Further research is warranted assessing means of improving the reach, uptake and generalisability of population guidelines for reducing listeriosis during pregnancy.},

	abstract = {Chronic painful Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is a common disorder among athletes. Sclerotherapy (ST) and prolotherapy (PT) are two promising options among the numerous other conservative therapies. As their efficacy and potential adverse effects (AE) are still unclear, we systematically searched, analyzed, and synthesized the available literature on ST and PT for treating AT. Electronic databases, Google Scholar and articles' reference lists were searched according to PRISMA guidelines. Eligibility criteria were set up according to the PICOS-scheme including human and animal studies. Three authors independently reviewed the results and evaluated methodological quality (Coleman Methodology Score and Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment). The initial search yielded 1104 entries. After screening, 18 articles were available for qualitative synthesis, six of which were subjected to meta-analysis. The mean Coleman Score of the 13 human studies was 50. Four RCTs were ranked as having a low risk of selection bias. Three of those reported a statistically significant drop in the visual analog scale (VAS) score, one a significant increase in the VISA-A Score. 12 of 13 human studies reported positive results in achieving pain relief and patient satisfaction, whereas only one study's finding differed. Meta-analysis revealed an unambiguous result in favor of the intervention (weighted mean difference D=-4.67 cm, 95\% CI -5.56 to -3.76 cm [P{\textless}.001]). Only one serious AE and two minor AEs were reported in the entire literature. This systematic review suggests that ST and PT may be effective treatment options for AT and that they can be considered safe. Long-term studies and RCTs are still needed to support their recommendation.},

PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus and SciELO are the main used databases and were searched in January 2019 by using the following keywords and their combinations: within-litter birth, weight variability, piglets, litter size, sow, amino acids, gestation, uniformity, CV and/or SD. Of the 64 pre-selected articles, only articles presenting the coefficients of variation and/or standard deviations according to the litter size and different levels of amino acid supplementation in the sow diets during gestation were selected. The average birth weights of total and live piglets were 43\% lower in litters from sows with high prolificacy than those from sows with low prolificacy. The weight variability was affected by high prolificacy sows, with increases of 4.04\% and 4.54\% in the coefficients of variation of total and born alive piglets respectively (p = .074; p = .009). The standard deviation increased by 180 g in born alive piglets to high prolificacy sows. The coefficients of variation of total and live piglets born from high prolificacy sows showed an increase of 4.04\% and 4.54\% respectively (p = .07; p {\textless} .05). There was a tendency for reduced weight variability with amino acids supplementation when considering the standard deviation of total born (p = .072). However, reproductive performance was not significantly influenced (p {\textgreater} .05). In conclusion, the average litter weight and the number of piglets born influence weight variability. Amino acids supplementation may reduce the birth weight variability between piglets. However, this effect depends on the amino acid used, the levels of supplementation and on other factors not completely addressed in this study. Thus, more research is necessary to fully elucidate this topic.},

Variations were observed regarding the presence and persistence of ZIKV in lower and upper genital samples. However, the FGT was the place in which ZIKV RNA has been detected, sometimes for relatively long periods, even after the clearance from blood and urine. In addition to the vagina and cervix, the endometrium, uterus and ovary (oocytes and follicles) could also be involved in persistent ZIKV infections.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several pharmacological therapeutic approaches have been proposed to manage osteoarthritis (OA), including intra-articular (IA) injections. Although the discovery of clodronate, a bisphosphonate, dates back to the 1960s and the effects of its IA administration have been investigated for decades in animal models, mechanisms of action of this drug are not quite clear, particularly in OA. This scoping review is an overview of the biological as well as the clinical role of clodronic acid in OA. METHOD: A scoping review based on the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) model was performed to characterize the mechanisms of action of IA clodronate in OA and to evaluate its efficacy from a clinical point of view. RESULTS: Several effects of clodronate have been observed in animal models of OA, including depletion of synovial lining cells that results in reduced production of chemokines (IL-1, TNF- α), growth factors (TGF-β, BMP 2/4), and metalloproteases (MMP 2/3/9); prevention of cartilage damage, synovial hyperplasia, and proteoglycans loss; reduction in joint inflammation, joint swelling, and osteophyte formation. From a clinical perspective, patients with knee OA treated with IA clodronate experienced improvements in pain and joint mobility. CONCLUSION: Clodronate appears to have different mechanisms of action interfering with the pathogenic processes contributing to OA development and progression. This intervention demonstrated positive effects for patients affected by knee OA.},

	abstract = {Distraction osteogenesis (DO) relies on the recruitment and proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to the target site, where they differentiate into osteoblasts to promote bone formation. Nevertheless, MSC recruitment appears to be slow and limits bone formation in DO defects. Thus, this systematic review aims to evaluate the ability of locally applied MSC to enhance bone formation in DO preclinical models. Databases were searched for quantitative pre-clinical controlled studies that evaluated the effect of local administration of MSC on DO bone formation. Eligible studies were identified and data regarding study characteristics, outcome measures and quality were extracted. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Autogenous and xenogenous MSC were used to promote DO bone formation. These included bone marrow-derived MSC, adipose tissue-derived MSC and MSC derived from human exfoliated deciduous teeth. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneities in study designs. Local MSC implantation was not associated with adverse effects. In 4 out of the 5 studies, locally delivered undifferentiated bone-marrow MSC had a positive effect on DO bone formation. Few studies evaluated the therapeutic effects of MSC from other sources. The adjunct use of biologically active molecules or forced expression of key genes involved in osteogenesis further boosted the ability of bone-marrow MSC to promote DO bone formation. While risk of bias and heterogeneity limited the strength of this systematic review, our results suggest that the use of MSC is safe and may provide beneficial effects on DO bone formation.},

We aim to give an overview of the metabolism and physiological effects of histidine in humans and different animal species through a systematic review following the guidelines of PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses). In humans, dietary histidine may be associated with factors that improve metabolic syndrome and has an effect on ion absorption. In rats, histidine supplementation increases food intake. It also provides neuroprotection at an early stage and could protect against epileptic seizures. In chickens, histidine is particularly important as a limiting factor for carnosine synthesis, which has strong anti-oxidant effects. In fish, dietary histidine may be one of the most important factors in preventing cataracts. In ruminants, histidine is a limiting factor for milk protein synthesis and could be the first limiting AA for growth. In excess, histidine supplementation can be responsible for eating and memory disorders in humans and can induce growth retardation and metabolic dysfunction in most species. To conclude, the requirements for histidine, like for other EAA, have been derived from growth and AA composition in tissues and also have specific metabolic roles depending on species and dietary levels.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Due to its high complexity, neurosurgery consists of a demanding learning curve that requires intense training and a deep knowledge of neuroanatomy. Microsurgical skill development can be achieved through various models of simulation, but as human cadaveric models are not always accessible, cadaveric animal models can provide a reliable environment in which to enhance the acquisition of surgical dexterity. The aim of this review was to analyse the current role of animal brains in laboratory training and to assess their correspondence to the procedures performed in humans. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A Pubmed literature search was performed to identify all the articles concerning training cranial and spinal techniques on large animal heads. The search terms were 'training model', and 'neurosurgery' in association with 'animal', 'sheep', 'cow', and 'swine'. The exclusion criteria were articles that were on human brains, experimental fundamental research, or on virtual simulators. RESULTS: The search retrieved 119 articles, of which 25 were relevant to the purpose of this review. Owing to their similar neuroanatomy, bovine, porcine and ovine models prove to be reliable structures in simulating neurosurgical procedures. On bovine skulls, an interhemispheric transcalosal and retrosigmoid approach along with different approaches to the Circle of Willis can be recreated. Ovine model procedures have varied from lumbar discectomies on sheep spines to craniosynostosis surgery, whereas in ex vivo swine models, cadaveric dissections of lateral sulcus, median and posterior fossa have been achieved. CONCLUSIONS: Laboratory training models enhance surgical advancements by familiarising trainee surgeons with certain neuroanatomical structures and promoting greater surgical dexterity. The accessibility of animal brains allows trainee surgeons to exercise techniques outside the operating theatre, thus optimising outcomes in human surgical procedures.},

Next, we estimated pooled differences between performances of poultry fed a diet with vs. without insects through random-effects meta-analysis models. Additionally, these models evaluated the effects of potential sources of heterogeneity across studies. Of the 75 studies reviewed, 41 met the inclusion criteria and included 174 trials. With respect to diets without insects, pooled differences in growth performances were statistically not different from the null, but heterogeneity was marked across studies. Average daily gain decreased with increasing inclusion rates of insects, going below the null for rates of 10\% and more. Grasshoppers were negatively associated with the average daily gain and positively associated with feed intake. The country of publication was another source of heterogeneity across publications. Overall, our results show insects should substitute only partially conventional protein sources and not be grasshoppers to guarantee the appropriate growth of birds.},

METHODS: Related papers were found by searching through PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and Google Scholar up to April 2020. Prospective cohort studies examined the association between consumption of the dietary protein from different sources and the risk of CHD and HTN in general population, were included. The random-effects model was used to pool the reported relative risks (RR). Dose-response associations were modeled by restricted cubic splines. RESULTS: Thirteen prospective studies, in total, including 547,303 participants- 11,590 cases with total CHD and 5,620 with HTN- were included. Dietary intake of total protein was not significantly associated with the risk of total CHD (RR: 0.97; 95\%CI: 0.90-1.05) and HTN (RR: 1.01; 95\% CI: 0.90-1.14). Moreover, consumption of both dietary plant and animal protein was not related to the risk of total CHD and HTN. Dose-response analysis indicated that the risk of CHD and HTN did not change significantly with increasing dietary total protein intake from 10\% to 25\% of total calorie intake. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary protein intake from different sources had no significant association with risk of CHD and HTN. Further high-quality research is needed to examine the potential mechanistic links between dietary protein intake and health outcomes.},

	abstract = {Clinical studies report that low circulating angiopoietin-1 concentration at presentation predicts worse outcomes after ischaemic stroke. Upregulating angiopoietin-1 may therefore have therapeutic benefit for ischaemic stroke. This systematic review assessed whether upregulating angiopoietin-1 improved outcomes in rodent models of ischaemic stroke. Random-effects models quantified the effect of angiopoietin-1 upregulation on stroke severity in terms of the size of cerebral infarction and the extent of blood-brain barrier permeability. Eleven studies utilising rat and mouse models of ischaemic stroke fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses demonstrated that angiopoietin-1 upregulation significantly reduced cerebral infarction size (standardised mean difference: -3.02; 95\% confidence intervals: -4.41, -1.63; p {\textless} 0.001; n = 171 animals) and improved blood-brain barrier integrity (standardized mean difference: -2.02; 95\% confidence intervals: -3.27, -0.77; p = 0.002; n = 129 animals). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that angiopoietin-1 upregulation improved outcomes in models of transient, not permanent cerebral ischaemia. Six studies assessed the effect of angiopoietin-1 upregulation on neurological function; however, inter-study heterogeneity prevented meta-analysis. In conclusion, published rodent data suggest that angiopoietin-1 upregulation improves outcome following temporary cerebral ischaemia by reducing cerebral infarction size and improving blood-brain barrier integrity. Additional research is required to examine the effect of angiopoietin-1 upregulation on neurological function during stroke recovery and investigate the benefit and risks in patients.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Fish consumption and dietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated acids (PUFAs) may be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to conduct a systematic review and summarize published articles on the association between fish consumption and dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs with the risk of IBD. METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were used to conduct a comprehensive search and identify eligible literature published prior to January 2019. Fixed-effects model or random-effects models (DerSimonian-Laird method) were applied to pool the effect sizes. Cochrane Q test was used to trace the potential source of heterogeneity across studies. RESULTS: 12 studies (5 prospective and 7 case-control) were included in the systematic review, which ten of them were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Studies were included a total sample size of 282610 participants which 2002 of them were cases of IBD [1061 Crohn's disease (CD) and 937 ulcerative colitis (UC)]. A negative association was found between fish consumption and the incidence of CD (pooled effect size: 0.54, 95\%CI: 0.31-0.96, P = 0.03). There was no relationship between total dietary n-3 PUFAs intake and IBD (pooled effect size: 1.17, 95\%CI: 0.80-1.72, P = 0.41). A significant inverse association was observed between dietary long-chain n-3 PUFAs and the risk of UC (pooled effect size: 0.75, 95\%CI: 0.57-0.98, P = 0.03). Moreover, no association was found between α-Linolenic acid (ALA) and IBD (pooled effect size: 1.17, 95\%CI: 0.63-2.17, P = 0.62). CONCLUSIONS: Findings showed a negative association between fish consumption and the risk of CD. Moreover, there was a significant inverse association between dietary long-chain n-3 PUFAs and the risk of UC.},

	abstract = {The significance of hepatitis E virus (HEV) as an important public health problem is rising. Until a decade ago, cases of HEV infection in Eur-ope were mainly confined to returning travelers, but nowadays, hepatitis E represents an emerging zoonotic infection in many European countries. The aim of this manuscript is to perform a systematic review of the published literature on hepatitis E distribution in humans, animals and environmental samples ("One Health" concept) in the South-Eastern European countries. Comparison of the available data showed that the anti-HEV seroprevalence in the South-Eastern Europe varies greatly, depending on the population studied, geographical area and methods used. The IgG seroprevalence rates in different population groups were found to be 1.1\%-24.5\% in Croatia, up to 20.9\% in Bulgaria, 5.9-\%17.1\% in Romania, 15\% in Serbia, up to 9.7\% in Greece and 2\%-9.7\% in Albania. Among possible risk factors, older age was the most significant predictor for HEV seropositivity in most studies. Higher seroprevalence rates were found in animals. HEV IgG antibodies in domestic pigs were detected in 20\%-54.5\%, 29.2\%-50\%, 38.94\%-50\% and 31.1\%-91.7\% in Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia, respectively. In wild boars seroprevalence rates were up to 10.3\%, 30.3\% and 31.1\% in Romania, Slovenia and Croatia, respectively. A high HEV RNA prevalence in wild boars in some countries (Croatia and Romania) indicated that wild boars may have a key role in the HEV epidemiology. There are very few data on HEV prevalence in environmental samples. HEV RNA was detected in 3.3\% and 16.7\% surface waters in Slovenia and Serbia, respectively. There is no evidence of HEV RNA in sewage systems in this region. The available data on genetic characterization show that human, animal and environmental HEV strains mainly belong to the genotype 3.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Foodborne Neglected Zoonotic Helminths (FNZH) are parasites of both economic and public health importance. They include Taenia solium, Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato, Echinococcus multilocularis and Foodborne trematodes (FBT). FNZH are earmarked for major interventions for control, elimination and eradication. This systematic review highlights the progress towards development of rapid tests for the diagnosis of FNZH since 2010 when they were listed as neglected tropical diseases. METHODOLOGY: A systematic search was conducted in three databases, World of Science, Embase and PubMed using the same search phrase. The search produced 480 hits. Three studies from back referencing were included. Only 22 of these met the inclusion criteria. Data was extracted from these and presented qualitatively. RESULTS: Twenty-five rapid diagnostic tests were found to have been developed since 2010, eight for diagnosis of T. solium infections, eight for echinococcosis and nine for FBT infections. The rapid tests for diagnosing T. solium infections included six antibody detecting and two antigen detecting tests. They constitute a combination among them, with some tests providing qualitative, others quantitative results. Similarly, seven out of the eight rapid tests developed for Echinococcus infections were antibody detecting tests save for one loop mediated isothermal amplification test. All of them were qualitative tests. For FBT infections, nine rapid tests were described; two antibody and one nucleic acid detecting test for diagnosis of Fascioliasis; three nucleic acid detecting tests for Opisthorchiasis; one antibody detecting test for Paragonimiasis; and for Clonorchiasis, one antibody and one nucleic acid detecting test. The FBT infection rapid tests were all qualitative in nature. Most of these tests have not undergone field evaluation in endemic areas where they will be used most. CONCLUSION: This review describes the development and evaluation of rapid diagnostic tests, while highlighting the need for in depth validations of the tools to determine how well they can perform in endemic areas.},

	abstract = {Viral infections are being managed therapeutically through available antiviral regimens with unsatisfactory clinical outcomes. The refractory viral infections resistant to available antiviral drugs are alarming threats and a serious health concern. For viral hepatitis, the interferon and vaccine therapies solely are not ultimate solutions due to recurrence of hepatitis C virus. Owing to the growing incidences of viral infections and especially of resistant viral strains, the available therapeutic modalities need to be improved, complemented with the discovery of novel antiviral agents to combat refractory viral infections. It is widely accepted that medicinal plant heritage is nature gifted, precious, and fueled with the valuable resources for treatment of metabolic and infectious disorders. The aims of this review are to assemble the facts and to conclude the therapeutic potential of medicinal plants in the eradication and management of various viral diseases such as influenza, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), hepatitis, and coxsackievirus infections, which have been proven in diverse clinical studies. The articles, published in the English language since 1982 to 2017, were included from Web of Science, Cochrane Library, AMED, CISCOM, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, and PubMed by using relevant keywords including plants possessing antiviral activity, the antiviral effects of plants, and plants used in viral disorders. The scientific literature mainly focusing on plant extracts and herbal products with therapeutic efficacies against experimental models of influenza, HIV, HSV, hepatitis, and coxsackievirus were included in the study. Pure compounds possessing antiviral activity were excluded, and plants possessing activity against viruses other than viruses in inclusion criteria were excluded. Hundreds of plant extracts with antiviral effect were recognized. However, the data from only 36 families investigated through in vitro and in vivo studies met the inclusion criteria of this review. The inferences from scientific literature review, focusing on potential therapeutic consequences of medicinal plants on experimental models of HIV, HSV, influenza, hepatitis, and coxsackievirus have ascertained the curative antiviral potential of plants. Fifty-four medicinal plants belonging to 36 different families having antiviral potential were documented. Out of 54 plants, 27 individually belong to particular plant families. On the basis of the work of several independent research groups, the therapeutic potential of medicinal plants against listed common viral diseases in the region has been proclaimed. In this context, the herbal formulations as alternative medicine may contribute to the eradication of complicated viral infection significantly. The current review consolidates the data of the various medicinal plants, those are Sambucus nigra, Caesalpinia pulcherrima, and Hypericum connatum, holding promising specific antiviral activities scientifically proven through studies on experimental animal models. Consequently, the original research addressing the development of novel nutraceuticals based on listed medicinal plants is highly recommended for the management of viral disorders.},

Five research articles addressed directly the effects of intermittent fasting on beta-amyloid levels in animal models of AD: alternate day fasting (ADF) and time-restricted feeding (TRF) methods were incorporated in these studies. The study designs were found to be heterogeneous. Variations in the levels of beta-amyloid peptides or plaque in either the hippocampus, cortical areas, or both in animals following dietary intervention were observed as compared to the ad libitum group. Non-significant changes were observed in three studies, while two studies interestingly demonstrated amelioration and reduction in beta-amyloid levels. Given the conflicting results obtained from this study, significant care has to be taken into consideration before the protocol can be applied as a preventative approach to treat Alzheimer's disease. Longitudinal research is warranted to fully grasp how dietary habits can help alleviate the disease either through upstream or downstream of AD pathology.},

	abstract = {Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and secretome are promising therapies for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). This meta-analysis aimed to provide a precise estimate and compare the therapeutic efficacy of MSC and secretome in PAH. We searched six databases (CINAHL, Cochrane, Ovid Medline, PubMed, Science Direct and Scopus) until December 2018 using search terms related to MSCs, secretome and PAH. Twenty-three studies were included for the meta-analysis. The effect size of pulmonary hemodynamics and right ventricular hypertrophy markers was estimated using random effects model. MSCs and secretome significantly improved pulmonary hemodynamics and right ventricular hypertrophy compared to control. Comparison between MSCs and secretome indicate no significant difference in reducing right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and medial wall thickening (MWT). However, treatment of PAH with secretome significantly improved mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) (p = 0.018) and right ventricular/left ventricular + septum (RV/LV+S) (p = 0.017) better than MSCs. Meta-regression shows that cell type (p = 0.034) is a predictor of MSCs to reduce RVSP in PAH. Similarly, the effect of secretome on MWT was significantly (p = 0.011) better at 4 weeks compared to 2 weeks of intervention. The overall risk of bias ranges from low to moderate; however, some of the essential elements required in reports of animal trials were not reported. There was evidence of publication bias for RV/LV+S and MWT, but not RVSP. This meta-analysis provides evidence of the therapeutic benefits of MSCs and secretome in PAH and the effect of secretome was similar or superior to MSCs.},

Stem cell therapy is evolving rapidly as an alternative for tissue regeneration. However, increasing evidence suggests that the regenerative ability of stem cells is mainly mediated by paracrine actions of secretome that are generally secreted by the cells. We aimed to systematically evaluate the efficacy of dental stem cell (DSC)-conditioned medium in in vivo animal models of various tissue defects. A total of 15 eligible studies was included by searching Pubmed, Scopus and Medline databases up to August 2017. The risk of bias was assessed using the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation risk of bias tool. Of 15 studies, seven reported the therapeutic benefit of the conditioned medium on neurological diseases and three reported on joint/bone-related defects. Two interventions were on liver diseases, whereas the remaining three addressed myocardial infarction and reperfusion, lung injury and diabetes. Nine studies were performed using mouse models and the remaining six studies used rat models. The methodological quality of the studies was low, as most of the key elements required in reports of preclinical studies were not reported. The findings of this review suggested that conditioned medium from DSCs improved tissue regeneration and functional recovery. This current review strengthens the therapeutic benefit of cell-free product for tissue repair in animal models. A well-planned study utilizing validated outcome measures and long-term safety studies are required for possible translation to clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) infection is one of the major causes of diarrheal disease throughout the world. In recent years, an increase in human S. Javiana infection has been reported from the southern part of the United States. However, the sources and routes of transmission of this Salmonella serotype are not well understood. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature to identify risk factors for human S. Javiana infection. Using PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic search in Web of Science, PubMed, and the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Searches returned 63 potential articles, of which 12 articles met all eligibility criteria and were included in this review. A review of the literature indicated that both food and non-food (such as animal contact) exposures are responsible for the transmission of S. Javiana infection to humans. Consumption of fresh produce (tomatoes and watermelons), herbs (paprika-spice), dairy products (cheese), drinking contaminated well water and animal contact were associated with human S. Javiana infections. Based on the findings of this study, control of human S. Javiana infection should include three factors, (a) consumption of drinking water after treatment, (b) safe animal contact, and (c) safe food processing and handling procedures. The risk factors of S. Javiana infections identified in the current study provide helpful insight into the major vehicles of transmission of S. Javiana. Eventually, this will help to improve the risk management of this Salmonella serotype to reduce the overall burden of NTS infection in humans.},

The aim of this systematic review was to compare immunogenicity and protective efficacy of various SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates tested in non-human primate (NHP) models. METHODS: Literature on effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in NHP models reported on PubMed and preprint platforms (medRxiv and bioRxiv) till October 22, 2020, was searched with the following terms: coronavirus vaccine, COVID-19 vaccine, SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, nonhuman primate, and rhesus macaque. RESULTS: Our search yielded 19 studies, which reported immune response elicited by 18 vaccine candidates in NHP. All the vaccines induced detectable neutralizing antibody (NAb) titres in the serum of vaccinated animals, with some showing effective viral clearance from various organs. The vaccinated animals also showed nil to mild histopathological changes in their lungs compared to placebo groups in the trials that performed necropsy. INTERPRETATION \& CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlighted onset of quick immunogenicity and protective efficacy of mRNA-1273, followed by Ad26.CoV2.S, NVX-CoV2373, BNT162b2, RBD and BBV152 vaccine candidates in preclinical trials as compared to the others. NHP data also showed correlation with clinical trial data available for a few vaccines. Preclinical trials of COVID-19 vaccine candidates in NHPs yielded promising results, with some candidates faring better than others.},

	abstract = {The role of farm animals in the emergence and dissemination of both AMR bacteria and their resistance determinants to humans is poorly understood and controversial. Here, we systematically reviewed the current evidence that food animals are responsible for transfer of AMR to humans. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE for literature published between 1940 and 2016. Our results show that eight studies (18\%) suggested evidence of transmission of AMR from food animals to humans, 25 studies (56\%) suggested transmission between animals and humans with no direction specified and 12 studies (26\%) did not support transmission. Quality of evidence was variable among the included studies; one study (2\%) used high resolution typing tools, 36 (80\%) used intermediate resolution typing tools, six (13\%) relied on low resolution typing tools, and two (5\%) based conclusions on co-occurrence of resistance. While some studies suggested to provide evidence that transmission of AMR from food animals to humans may occur, robust conclusions on the directionality of transmission cannot be drawn due to limitations in study methodologies. Our findings highlight the need to combine high resolution genomic data analysis with systematically collected epidemiological evidence to reconstruct patterns of AMR transmission between food animals and humans.},

CONCLUSIONS: The evidence from these trials suggests that propolis is the best of all natural possibilities in the treatment of herpetic skin lesions, especially those related to HSV-1. Future studies should analyse if propolis could be an adjunct to treatment with acyclovir. For lesions in the oral cavity, honey could be an interesting alternative.},

The review followed the PRISMA method, searching for articles in PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS and ISI Web of Science, by employing the following terms: 'leishmaniasis', 'cutaneous leishmaniasis', 'mucocutaneous leishmaniasis', 'diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis', 'Leishmania' and 'metalloproteases'. GP63 of New World Leishmania species is a parasite metalloproteases involved in the degradation and cleavage of many biological molecules as kappa-B nuclear factor, fibronectin, tyrosine phosphatases. GP63 is capable of inhibiting the activity of the complement system and reduces the host's immune functions, allowing the survival of the parasite and its dissemination. High serological/tissue levels of host matrix metalloproteases (MMP)-9 have been associated with tissue damage during the infection, while high transcriptional levels of MMP-2 related with a satisfactory response to treatment. Host MMPs serological and tissue levels have been investigated using Western Blot, zymography, and Real Time polymerase chain reaction. GP63 detection characterizes species and virulence in promastigotes isolated from lesions samples using techniques mentioned previously. The monitoring of host MMPs levels and GP63 in Leishmania isolated from host samples could be used on the laboratory routine to predict the prognostic and treatment efficacy of ATL.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: MiRNAs have been shown to play a crucial role among lung cancer, pulmonary fibrosis, tuberculosis (TBC) infection, and bronchial hypersensitivity, thus including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. The oncogenic effect of several miRNAs has been recently ruled out. In order to act on miRNAs turnover, antagomiRs have been developed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The systematic review was conducted under the PRISMA guidelines (registration number is: CRD42019134173). The PubMed database was searched between 1 January 2000 and 30 April 2019 under the following search strategy: (((antagomiR) OR (mirna antagonists) OR (mirna antagonist)) AND ((lung[MeSH Terms]) OR ("lung diseases"[MeSH Terms]))). We included original articles, published in English, whereas exclusion criteria included reviews, meta-analyses, single case reports, and studies published in a language other than English. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A total of 68 articles matching the inclusion criteria were retrieved. Overall, the use of antagomiR was seen to be efficient in downregulating the specific miRNA they are conceived for. The usefulness of antagomiRs was demonstrated in humans, animal models, and cell lines. To our best knowledge, this is the first article to encompass evidence regarding miRNAs and their respective antagomiRs in the lung, in order to provide readers a comprehensive review upon major lung disorders.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Surgical manipulations of adipose tissue by removal, or partial lipectomy, have demonstrated body fat compensation and recovered body weight, suggesting that the body is able to resist changes to body composition. However, the mechanisms underlying these observations are not well understood. The purpose of this scoping review is to provide an update on what is currently known about the regulation of energetics and body fat after surgical manipulations of adipose tissue in small mammals. METHODS: PubMed and Scopus were searched to identify 64 eligible studies. Outcome measures included body fat, body weight, food intake, and circulating biomarkers. RESULTS: Surgeries performed included lipectomy (72\%) or transplantation (12\%) in mice (35\%), rats (35\%), and other small mammals. Findings suggested that lipectomy did not have consistent long-term effects on reducing body weight and fat because regain occurred within 12 to 14 weeks post surgery. Hence, biological feedback mechanisms act to resist long-term changes of body weight or fat. Furthermore, whether this weight and fat regain occurred because of "passive" and "active" regulation under the "set point" or "settling point" theories cannot fully be discerned because of limitations in study designs and data collected. CONCLUSIONS: The regulation of energetics and body fat are complex and dynamic processes that require further studies of the interplay of genetic, physiological, and behavioral factors.},

The objective was to evaluate the effects of oxytocin and carbetocin on farrowing duration, birth interval, farrowing assistance, stillbirth rate, and piglet viability traits by performing a systematic review and a meta-analysis. The search for studies was performed during January 2020 using the PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Science Direct, and Scopus databases. The literature search was conducted using the key words: oxytocin, pig, farrowing, stillbirth, piglet, dose, and carbetocin. Studies which evaluated the effects of oxytocin or carbetocin on farrowing duration, birth interval, stillbirth rate, and farrowing assistance were included in the review. Of 1215 articles, 23 (1.9\%) were selected for fulfilling the criteria for inclusion in the present study. A high variety of doses was observed among studies. Oxytocin increased (30\%; P {\textless} 0.05) the stillborn proportion in the litters compared to control sows. Both oxytocin and carbetocin increased the need of farrowing assistance by 137\% (P {\textless} 0.01) and 40\% (P {\textless} 0.05), respectively, compared to control. The use of oxytocin reduced the farrowing duration by 18\% and the birth interval by 17\%, while carbetocin reduced the same responses by 27 and 23\%, respectively (P {\textless} 0.01). When used judiciously, uterotonics are a valuable tool to shorten farrowing duration of hyperprolific sows. However, the treatment is not exempt of deleterious effects for piglets and sows. Therefore, the criteria to use these drugs should be based on individual cases and not as part of hormonal protocols for all parturient sows.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Concepts that showed substantial efficacy in animal models of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) often failed to improve outcome in humans with aneurysmal SAH. The concept of "comparative medicine," an open-minded comparison across species, might offer an alternative to the "constructed" animal models' approach. Naturally occurring diseases in animals might bear more similarity to human diseases than models. In this context, the question arises whether spontaneous intracranial aneurysms exist in animals or not, and whether they cause SAH or not. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed. Only articles dealing with natural aneurysms and/or SAH of mammals other than man were included. All articles dealing with induced aneurysms and/or SAH were removed. RESULTS: Of 2812 screened articles, 9 articles describing natural intracranial aneurysms and/or SAH were found. In total 1979 individual animals of 29 species were examined. Natural intracranial aneurysms were described in 7 individual animals of 6 species. Spontaneous SAH was described in 3 species. In 1 chimpanzee, a ruptured intracranial aneurysm caused an SAH. Histological descriptions of the aneurysms were strikingly similar to those of humans. CONCLUSIONS: Although interesting and innovative, the concept of "comparative medicine" seems to be impracticable due to the seemingly ultralow incidence of natural aneurysmal SAH in mammals other than man. The answer to the question "why intracranial aneurysms are less common in animals despite the strong histological similarity of cerebral arteries" might be a key issue. Last but not least, primates likely matter in SAH-related research, as aneurysmal SAH occurs in primates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy (AT) is prevalent amongst athletic and non-athletic populations with pain, stiffness and impaired function typically reported. While different management options exist, loading protocols remain the best available intervention and have been shown to be effective in the management of AT. Trials investigating loading in AT have used a variety of different protocols, and recent narrative reviews suggest that no protocol is superior to another when comparing outcomes in pain and function. However, there has been no systematic review or meta-analysis completed to determine this. Furthermore, the narrative review did not consider wait-and-see or sham interventions, thus a systematic review and met-analysis which includes wait-and-see or sham interventions is warranted. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analyses will be conducted as per the PRISMA guidelines. The databases PUBMED, CINAHL (Ovid) and CINAHL (EBSCO) will be searched for articles published from inception to 31 December 2017. Our search focuses on studies examining the improvement of pain and function when completing a loading program for mid-portion AT. Only randomised/ quasi-randomised trials will be included while case reports and case series will be excluded. The primary outcome assessing pain and function will be the Victorian Institute Sports Assessment - Achilles (VISA-A). Two reviewers will screen articles, extract data and assess the risk of bias independently with a third reviewer resolving any disagreements between the two reviewers. A meta-analysis will then be performed on the data (if appropriate) to determine if the traditional heavy load calf training protocol described by Alfredson is superior to wait-and-see, sham intervention, traditional physiotherapy, and other forms of exercise rehabilitation. DISCUSSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis will allow us to investigate if there are difference in pain and function when comparing wait-and-see, sham interventions, traditional physiotherapy and different exercise interventions to the traditional heavy eccentric calf training protocol for mid-portion Achilles tendon pain.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of heavy eccentric calf training (HECT) in comparison with natural history, traditional physiotherapy, sham interventions or other exercise interventions for improvements in pain and function in mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy. DESIGN: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted as per the PRISMA guidelines. DATA SOURCES: PUBMED, CINAHL (Ovid) and CINAHL (EBSCO) were searched from inception until 24 September 2018. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials comparing HECT to natural history, sham exercise, traditional physiotherapy and other exercise interventions were included. Primary outcome assessing pain and function was the Victorian Institute of Sports Assessment-Achilles. RESULTS: Seven studies met the inclusion criteria. This review suggests HECT may be superior to both natural history, mean difference (MD) (95\% CI) of 20.6 (11.7 to 29.5, one study) and traditional physiotherapy, MD (95\% CI) of 17.70 (3.75 to 31.66, two studies). Following removal of one study, at high risk of bias, due to pre-planned sensitivity analysis, this review suggests HECT may be inferior to other exercise interventions, MD (95\% CI) of -5.65 (-10.51 to -0.79, three studies). However, this difference is unlikely to be clinically significant. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that HECT may be superior to natural history and traditional physiotherapy while HECT may be inferior to other exercise interventions. However, due to methodological limitations, small sample size and a lack of data we are unable to be confident in the results of the estimate of the effect, as the true effect is likely to be substantially different.

Accumulating evidence suggests that the deleterious effects of these diets appear more pronounced in animals maintained on this diet early in life, consistent with the notion that the developing brain may be especially vulnerable to environmental insults. The current paper provides the first systematic review of studies comparing the effects of high-fat, high-sugar diet exposure during adolescence and adulthood on memory performance. The majority of studies (7/8) identified here report diet-induced memory problems when diet exposure began in adolescence but not adulthood. These findings lend support to the hypothesis that adolescence is a sensitive period during which palatable diets may contribute to negative neurocognitive effects. The current review explores putative mechanisms involved in diet-induced cognitive dysfunction and highlights promising areas for further research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ticks are blood-sucking ectoparasites and transmit various types of protozoal, bacterial, and viral diseases in a wild as well as domestic animals and humans globally. Only a few  published reports are avaliable on the prevalence of tick-borne diseases in sheep and goats in Pakistan. AIM AND OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the prevalence (2000-2020) of tick-borne disease (theileriosis, babesiosis, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever infection, and anaplasmosis) in sheep and goats in Pakistan. METHODS: A systematic review of articles published in English language (since 2000-2020) was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar. Diagnostic methods used in the original reference articles were PCR, PCR-RLB, microscopy, and ELISA. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of theileriosis, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) infections was 15.40\%, 21.18\%, 26.78\%, and 11.62\%, respectively. The prevalence of anaplasmosis was 22.06\% (90/408) in sheep, 21.11\% (76/360) in goats, and 40\% (120/300) in both sheep and goats with substantial differences (P {\textless} 0.001). The prevalence of babesiosis among sheep was 29.88\% (104/348) with highly significant differences (P {\textless} 0.001), in goats was 29.88\% (25/60) with slightly significant differences (P {\textless} 0.031\%), and in both sheep and goats were 7\% (21/300) with highly significant differences (P {\textless} 0.001) according to subgroup analysis. The percentage of prevalence of theileriosis was 17.70\% (207/1169) in sheep with highly substantial differences (P {\textless} 0.001), 4.51\% (31/687) in goats with significant differences (P {\textless} 0.133), and 25\% (125/500) in both sheep and goats with a significant difference among them (P {\textless} 0.001). The prevalence of CCHF among sheep was 18.63\% (149/800) and 4.63\% (37/800) in goats, respectively. The widely used detection method was microscopy (45.56\%) followed by ELISA (38.38\%), PCR (12.56\%), and PCR-RLB (3.48\%) test, respectively. This is a comprehensive report on the status of tick-borne disease in sheep and goats in Pakistan. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, among tick-borne diseases anaplasmosis had the highest prevalence rate in sheep and goats. Due to its high prevalence, control measures should be taken to diagnose and prevent it.},

	abstract = {AIM: This was a systematic review conducted to evaluate the analgesic drugs and techniques used in the management of pain in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Systematic searches in PubMed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect were conducted for peer-reviewed articles written in English and published from 1995 to 2015. The key search words were dogs, ovariohysterectomy, pain, and analgesics. This was followed by a manual search of the references within the primary data sources. Inclusion and exclusion of studies and data extraction were performed independently by two reviewers. All randomized studies evaluating the effects of analgesics during ovariohysterectomy in dogs were included. RESULTS: A total of 31 trials met the criteria and were, therefore, included in the study. Data on the type of analgesic drugs used, the technique of administration, and the need for rescue analgesia were extracted from the papers. Individual analgesic protocols were used in 83.9\% of the studies compared to multimodal drug therapy, which was used in 16.1\% of the studies. Opioids were used in 39.0\% of studies, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in 19.4\%, a combination of NSAIDs and opioids in 19.4\%, local analgesics in 6.5\%, and acupuncture in 3.2\% of the studies. Drug administration was done using three approaches that included pre-operative (64.5\%), post-operative (22.6\%) as well as combined pre- and post-operative approach (12.9\%). In 77.4\% of the studies, administration of analgesics was done once, while in 12.9\%, it was done as a 72-h post-operative course. 24-h and 48-h courses of post-operative pain therapy were done in 6.5\% and 3.2\% of the studies, respectively. About 57\% of the dogs in the control groups required rescue analgesia as compared to 21.6\% in the single and 11.3\% in multimodal drug therapy groups. The requirement for rescue analgesics was highest in dogs treated using acupuncture (43.8\%) and lowest in dogs treated using NSAID-opioid combination (8.6\%). Fewer dogs among those that received pain medication preoperatively and postoperatively required rescue analgesia compared to those in groups given drugs before and after surgery only. More dogs (26.4\%) among those given analgesics only once postoperatively required rescue analgesia as compared to those that received analgesics daily for 72 h (4.4\%). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that opioids are the mainstream analgesic drugs used in managing acute post-operative pain in dogs' post-ovariohysterectomy. In addition, multimodal drug therapy, particularly, NSAID-opioids combination is more effective for pain management than single drug administration. Administering analgesics both before and after surgery is associated with better outcomes and so is a protracted course of post-operative pain therapy. Although these practices should be encouraged, controlled studies should be conducted to conclusively determine the best practices for pain management in dogs undergoing ovariohysterectomy.},

The focus is on types of high tech biotechnological based vaccines, target gene or antigen in developing these vaccines, and challenge model fish species used in vaccines efficacy testing. Vaccines delivery methods, immune response, and their efficacy, adjuvant or carrier systems used, and the overall experimental setup or design of the vaccines under investigation are also described. The search for the original papers published between 2009 and 2018 was conducted in June of 2018, using the PubMed and Google scholar electronic database. Twenty-three (23/4386) studies were included in the final assembly using PRISMA guidelines (Protocol not registered). Recombinant protein vaccines were the highly experimented type of the modern biotechnological based vaccines identified in the selected studies (16/23; 70\%). Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of different β-barrels were shown to be a potential antigenic entity for A. hydrophila vaccines (57\%). Intraperitoneal route with conventional carries or adjuvants was the highly applied delivery system while very few studies used herbal based vaccine adjuvants and nanomaterial as a vaccine carrier. Variation was observed in terms of protection levels in the selected studies. The experimental designs partly contributed to the observed variation. Therefore, recombinant vaccines that use new carrier system technologies and delivered through oral route in feeds would have been of great value for use in the prevention and control of A. hydrophila infections in fish. Despite the usefulness as academic tools to identify what is important in pathogenicity of the etiological agent to the host fish, these vaccines are only economically viable in very high-value animals. Therefore, if vaccination is a good option for A. hydrophila group, then simple autogenous vaccines based on accurate typing and evidence-based definition of the epidemiological unit for their use would be the most viable approach in terms of both efficacy and economic feasibility especially in low and middle-income countries (LMIC).},

	abstract = {Introduction: Zinc (Zn) is well known as an essential trace element in animal nutrition to ensure optimal body functions and animal health. Previous studies have demonstrated that Zn supplementation has improved the rate of animal growth in practical feeding regimes. Traditionally, the farm animal diets have been supplemented with Zn in the inorganic forms as either zinc oxide or zinc sulfate. The use of organic Zn sources in the form of chelates and supplements for ruminant diets has increased in recent years. Many studies have been conducted to interrogate the relative bioavailability of organic Zn sources in comparison to inorganic forms in ruminant nutrition. Meta-analysis is the statistical combination of results from two or more independent studies for the purpose of integrating findings or results for the under study subject. Meta-analysis can be helpful in determining whether multiple tests of an intervention yield effects on an outcome construct of interest that are similar in direction and magnitude. In the current meta-analysis the organic and inorganic zinc supplementation effects on performance of fattening lambs have been compared. Materials and Methods: A literature search was initially conducted using PubMed, Medline, Science Direct, and Google Scholar data bases and investigated references in the papers. It was also based on the following key words: zinc, organic zinc, inorganic zinc, zinc sulfate, zinc oxide, zinc methionine, zinc proteinate (s), zinc polysaccharide, growth performance, and fattening lamb. The resulting 14 articles were examined for inclusion or exclusion in this analysis. Then seven studies were included in this meta-analysis; and prepared 14 comparisons for average daily gain, 12 comparisons for average dry matter intake and feed efficiency, 11 comparisons for serum/plasma zinc concentration and super oxide dismutase activity, and 13 for alkaline phosphatase activity. Meta-analyses were carried out using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis package, version 2. The size effects of across studies were calculated with fixed and random effect models. The presence of true heterogeneity among studies was identified with Cochran's Q-tests and quantification of the degree of heterogeneity was done with the I2 index. Possible publication bias was evaluated with funnel plot and statistical tests. Results and Discussion: The results of this meta-analysis showed that the addition of Zn in the diet, has a positive effects on average daily body weight gain (+0.5+or-0.17), increase in serum or plasma zinc content (+1.13+or-0.225) and alkaline phosphatase enzyme (+1.4+or-0.205) and superoxide dismutase activity (0.8+or-0.226). However, Zn supplementation in either form (inorganic or organic) had no significant effects on some variable such as daily feed intake (-0.05+or-0.161) and feed conversion ratio (0.06+or-0.241). This quantitative meta-analysis of data from several experiments indicated that dietary Zn supplementation significantly increased average daily body weight gain, serum or plasma Zn concentration, alkaline phosphatase and superoxide dismutase activity in fattening lambs. Superoxide dismutase is a redox metalloenzyme involving in cell defense mechanisms against oxidative stress as well as animal health. This enzyme can reduce oxidative stress therefore improves immune functions.},

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science until December 2019, and references of retrieved relevant articles. STUDY SELECTION: Prospective cohort studies that reported the risk estimates for all cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality in adults aged 18 or older. DATA SYNTHESIS: Random effects models were used to calculate pooled effect sizes and 95\% confidence intervals for the highest versus lowest categories of protein intake and to incorporate variation between studies. Linear and non-linear dose-response analyses were done to evaluate the dose-response relations between protein intake and mortality. RESULTS: 32 prospective cohort studies were included in the systematic review and 31 in the meta-analysis. During the follow-up period of 3.5 to 32 years, 113 039 deaths (16 429‬ from cardiovascular disease and 22 303‬ from cancer) occurred among 715 128 participants. Intake of total protein was associated with a lower risk of all cause mortality (pooled effect size 0.94, 95\% confidence interval 0.89 to 0.99, I(2)=58.4\%, P{\textless}0.001). Intake of plant protein was significantly associated with a lower risk of all cause mortality (pooled effect size 0.92, 95\% confidence interval 0.87 to 0.97, I(2)=57.5\%, P=0.003) and cardiovascular disease mortality (pooled hazard ratio 0.88, 95\% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.96, I(2)=63.7\%, P=0.001), but not with cancer mortality. Intake of total and animal protein was not significantly associated with risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer mortality. A dose-response analysis showed a significant inverse dose-response association between intake of plant protein and all cause mortality (P=0.05 for non-linearity). An additional 3\% energy from plant proteins a day was associated with a 5\% lower risk of death from all causes. CONCLUSIONS: Higher intake of total protein was associated with a lower risk of all cause mortality, and intake of plant protein was associated with a lower risk of all cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. Replacement of foods high in animal protein with plant protein sources could be associated with longevity.},

	abstract = {Leptospirosis is probably the most widespread zoonotic disease in the world especially in tropical countries. There has been an increase in individual studies, which assessed the frequency of leptospirosis in flood conditions. Some studies showed contact with floods was significantly associated with the occurrence of leptospirosis while other studies reported differently. The objective of this meta-analysis was to synthesize the evidence on the risk factors which are associated with human leptospirosis following flooding. We set up the inclusion criteria and searched for the original studies, addressing leptospirosis in human with related to flood in health-related electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Ovid Medline, google scholar and Scopus sources. We used the terms 'leptospirosis', 'flood', 'risk factor' and terms from the categories were connected with "OR" within each category and by "AND" between categories. The initial search yielded 557 citations. After the title and abstract screening, 49 full-text papers were reviewed and a final of 18 observational studies met the pre-specified inclusion criteria. Overall, the pooled estimates of 14 studies showed that the contact with flooding was a significant factor for the occurrence of leptospirosis (pooled OR: 2.19, 95\%CI: 1.48-3.24, I2:86\%). On stratification, the strength of association was greater in the case-control studies (pooled OR: 4.01, 95\%CI: 1.26-12.72, I2:82\%) than other designs (pooled OR:1.77,95\%CI:1.18-2.65, I2:87\%). Three factors such as 'being male'(pooled OR:2.06, 95\%CI:1.29-2.83), the exposure to livestock animals (pooled OR: 1.95, 95\%CI:1.26-2.64), the lacerated wound (pooled OR:4.35, 95\%CI:3.07-5.64) were the risk factors significantly associated with the incidence of leptospirosis following flooding in the absence of within-study heterogeneity (I2: 0\%). We acknowledge study limitations such as publication bias and type 2 statistical errors. We recommended flood control and other environmental modifications that are expected to reduce the risk of leptospiral infection, and a multi-sectoral effort to this aspect would have long-term benefits.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are now the first choice thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients who do not have a high risk of bleeding. In addition to the anticoagulant effects, potential anti-tumor effects of DOACs have also been studied in animal cancer models. In this study, we summarize the effects of DOACs on cancer growth and metastasis in animal models through a systematic review with a qualitative analysis. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were systematically searched for original studies that describe animal models of cancer in which one of the experimental groups received DOAC monotherapy, and which reported quantitatively on primary tumor or metastases. RESULTS: Nine studies - reporting a total of 19 animal experiments - met the inclusion criteria. These 19 experiments included spontaneous cancer (n = 2), carcinogenicity (n = 2), xenograft (n = 7) and syngeneic (n = 8) models, encompassing orthotopic (n = 7), subcutaneous (n = 5), intraperitoneal (n = 1) and intravenous (n = 2) injection of cancer cells and included treatments with the DOACs ximelagatran (n = 4), dabigatran etexilate (n = 6) and/or rivaroxaban (n = 11). DOAC treatment decreased tumor growth at implanted and metastatic site in 18.8\% (3/16) and 20.0\% (3/15) of the experiments, respectively. Conversely, DOACs increased tumor growth at implanted and metastatic site in 6.3\% (1/16) and 20.0\% (3/15) of the experiments, respectively. CONCLUSION: DOAC monotherapy resulted in neoplastic changes in a rat carcinogenicity study, showed a lack of effect in mouse xenograft models, while the effect on cancer growth and metastasis in mouse syngeneic models depended on the timing of DOAC treatment and type of cancer model used.},

	abstract = {In vivo optical imaging is a powerful tool for revealing brain structure and function at both the circuit and cellular levels. Here, we provide a systematic review of findings obtained from in vivo imaging studies of mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders, including the monogenic disorders fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, and Angelman syndrome, which are caused by genetic abnormalities of FMR1, MECP2, and UBE3A, as well as disorders caused by copy number variations (15q11-13 duplication and 22q11.2 deletion) and BTBR mice as an inbred strain model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most studies visualize the structural and functional responsiveness of cerebral cortical neurons to sensory stimuli and the developmental and experience-dependent changes in these responses as a model of brain functions affected by these disorders. The optical imaging techniques include two-photon microscopy of fluorescently labeled dendritic spines or neurons loaded with fluorescent calcium indicators and macroscopic imaging of cortical activity using calcium indicators, voltage-sensitive dyes or intrinsic optical signals. Studies have revealed alterations in the density, stability, and turnover of dendritic spines, aberrant cortical sensory responses, impaired inhibitory function, and concomitant failure of circuit maturation as common causes for neurological deficits. Mechanistic hypotheses derived from in vivo imaging also provide new directions for therapeutic interventions. For instance, it was recently demonstrated that early postnatal administration of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) restores impaired cortical inhibitory function and ameliorates the aberrant social behaviors in a mouse model of ASD. We discuss the potential use of SSRIs for treating ASDs in light of these findings.},

	abstract = {There are considerable disagreements on the application of olfactory ensheathing cells (OEC) for spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation. The present meta-analysis was designed to investigate the efficacy of OEC transplantation on motor function recovery and neuropathic pain alleviation in SCI animal models. Accordingly, all related studies were identified and included. Two independent researchers assessed the quality of the articles and summarized them by calculating standardized mean differences (SMD). OEC transplantation was shown to significantly improve functional recovery (SMD = 1.36; 95\% confidence interval: 1.05-1.68; p {\textless} 0.001). The efficacy of this method was higher in thoracic injuries (SMD = 1.41; 95\% confidence interval: 1.08-1.74; p {\textless} 0.001) and allogeneic transplants (SMD = 1.53; 95\% confidence interval: 1.15-1.90; p {\textless} 0.001). OEC transplantation had no considerable effects on the improvement of hyperalgesia (SMD = -0.095; 95\% confidence interval: -0.42-0.23; p = 0.57) but when the analyses were limited to studies with follow-up ≥8 weeks, it was associated with increased hyperalgesia (SMD = -0.66; 95\% confidence interval: -1.28-0.04; p = 0.04). OEC transplantation did not affect SCI-induced allodynia (SMD = 0.54; 95\% confidence interval: -0.80-1.87; p = 0.43). Our findings showed that OEC transplantation can significantly improve motor function post-SCI, but it has no effect on allodynia and might lead to relative aggravation of hyperalgesia.},

	abstract = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative joint disease and is considered as the most common cause of pain and disability. To the best of our knowledge, it is generally observed that there is a lack of evidence on the effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on inflammatory cytokines in OA. The present review aims to appraise the current evidence of efffects of LLLT on inflammatory cytokines in OA of the knee. Medical databases such as Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, PEDro CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane register, and Google reference were searched from its inception to June 2019. Articles that meet the inclusion criteria: subjects (animals-Wistar rats) induced with OA; rats with age group of 50-90 days; weight of 150-300 g; finding the effects of LLLT; reporting inflammatory cytokines; and articles written in English were included. The reviewers assessed the methodological quality of the primary studies. Data of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and MMP-13 were extracted for analysis. The Q (x(2)) test and I(2) statistics analysis were performed to find the heterogeneity evaluation. Standard mean difference (SMD) and its 95\% confidence interval (CI) were used to synthesize the data. Two hundred eleven potential articles were identified and 186 articles were excluded based on the selection criteria. The rest of the 25 articles were read and 8 articles were selected for further study. From the study, it is observed that the laser therapy group had mild to moderate improvement than control group in IL-1β, TNF-α, and MMP-13 (IL-1β; SMD 1.21 [95\% CI - 0.278, 2.704], TNF-α; SMD 5.19 [95\% CI 2.413, 7.961], and MMP-13 SMD - 1.45 [95\% CI - 5.121, 2.211]), while IL-6 [SMD 3.11 (95\% CI 0.662, 5.549] did not show any considerable improvement after laser therapy. The present review provides the evidence of LLLT-dependent reduction of IL-1β, TNF-α, and MMP-13, and its ability to modulate proliferation of inflammatory cells, which makes LLLT a suitable treatment for OA. Though the included studies showed a high heterogeneity in treatment parameter, the beneficial effect of LLLT on changes in inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, seems to be unaffected.},

	abstract = {Clinical mastitis affects 3\% of primiparous dairy cattle (heifers) in the first month after calving. Additionally, the prevalence of intramammary infection (IMI) in the months before first calving is high, resulting in a high prevalence of heifers calving with IMI. Precalving therapy is an accepted recommendation for reducing mastitis in multiparous cows, but prophylactic treatment for heifers is uncommon in North America. Objectives of this study were to (1) quantify changes in postcalving udder health in heifers following application of a precalving treatment; (2) compare effectiveness among various types of treatments; and (3) compare effectiveness of various types of treatments against specific pathogens. A systematic review was conducted comparing interventions aimed at improving udder health in heifers. Of 62 included studies, 48 clinical trials were used in a meta-analysis. Data were synthesized using a random effects model for meta-analysis, followed by sub-group analyses comparing treatment types, and specific pathogens with statistical testing using meta-regression. Occurrence of mastitis (defined as elevated somatic cell count, clinical mastitis, and IMI) was reduced in treated heifers compared with untreated controls with a pooled risk ratio of treated to untreated heifers of 0.56 (95\% confidence interval: 0.47 to 0.67). Upon stratification by treatment types, teat sealants and combination therapies (vaccines and antimicrobials; antimicrobials and teat sealants; and all 3) were most effective at improving udder health with pooled risk ratios of 0.40 (95\% confidence interval: 0.30 to 0.52) and 0.34 (95\% confidence interval: 0.25 to 0.45), respectively. Antimicrobials and vaccines also reduced occurrence of IMI and subclinical and clinical mastitis when compared with untreated heifers. Although variation was observed in the pathogen-specific effectiveness of treatments at reducing rates of disease, antimicrobials, teat sealants, and combinations of vaccines or teat sealants with antimicrobials were consistently effective, whereas vaccines were only effective for contagious pathogens. Recommendations for use of antibiotics should consider their relative benefit while also considering potential for increasing antimicrobial resistance.},

	abstract = {Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is the most widespread, tick-borne viral disease affecting humans and therefore this paper performed a meta-analysis to highlight seroprevalence features of CCHF in a global context. After a preliminary review of the 396 papers representing areas throughout the world, 206 were selected for detailed meta-analysis. In general the total means of CCHF seroprevalence were, respectively 4.7 and 24.6\% for humans and animals; and 17.1, 18.9, 24.3, 29.3 and 27.1\% for camels, cattle, goats, sheep and livestock. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference in seroprevalence between humans and camels (P = 0.043), cattle (P = 0.010), goats (P = 0.015), sheep (P = 0.005) and livestock (P = 0.017). Regionally, there also was a difference between humans, and goats (P = 0.0001), sheep (P = 0.007) and livestock (P = 0.002). Globally, CCHF seroprevalence in at-risk professionals was 7.5 fold greater than in normal humans, while CCHF seroprevalence was 5 fold greater in animals, camels, cattle, goats, sheep and livestock than normal humans. Animal contact, animal husbandry, farming, tick bite history and secretion exposure were the most frequently reported CCHF seropositivity risk factors. This study serves as an important resource for epidemiological discussions related to CCHF and CCHF seroprevalence features, providing specific information in understanding human and animal mean and trend CCHF seroprevalence for different regions of the world and on an aggregate global scale; seroprevalence in at-risk professionals; and total mean and trend CCHF seropositivity involving risk factors.},

Although T. gondii does not appear to parasitize cold-blooded animals, the occurrence of T. gondii infection in marine mammals raises concerns that cold-blooded animals (frogs, toad, turtles, crocodiles, snakes, and fish) and shellfish are potential sources of T. gondii. Therefore, this systematic review aimed to determine the prevalence of T. gondii in mollusks and cold-blooded animals worldwide. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to 1 August 2020 for eligible papers in the English language and identified 26 articles that reported the prevalence of T. gondii in mollusks and cold-blooded animals. These articles were subsequently reviewed and data extracted using a standard form. In total, 26 studies [involving 9 cross-sectional studies including 2988 samples of cold-blooded animals (129 positive cases for T. gondii) and 18 cross-sectional studies entailing 13 447 samples of shellfish (692 positive cases for T. gondii)] were included in this study. Although this study showed that shellfish and cold-blooded animals could be potential sources of T. gondii for humans and other hosts that feed on them, further investigations are recommended to determine the prevalence of T. gondii in shellfish and cold-blooded animals.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is a zoonotic apicomplexan protozoan that can cause reproductive losses in ruminants across the world. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the worldwide prevalence of T. gondii infection in the aborted fetuses and stillbirths of sheep, goat, and cattle. Moreover, it attempted to evaluate the prevalence rate of T. gondii infection in ruminants that had abortions using serological methods. Based on the keywords, a systematic search of six databases was conducted to retrieve cross-sectional articles in English-language. Data were synthesized to calculate the overall prevalence of T. gondii infection worldwide using the random-effects model with a 95 \% confidence interval (CI). Moreover, the present study includes sensitivity analysis, publication bias test, and quality assessment of the studies. The final analyses included 37, 19, and 8 studies conducted on sheep (4383 aborted fetuses and stillbirths as well as 1940 abortive sheep), goat (248 aborted fetuses and stillbirths and 533 abortive goats), and cattle (460 aborted fetuses and stillbirths and 165 abortive cattle). The overall prevalence rates of T. gondii infection in aborted fetuses and stillbirths globally were 42 \% (95 \% CI: 17 \%-67 \%), and 31 \% (95 \% CI: 11 \%-51 \%) using molecular methods for sheep and goats, as well as 16 \% (95 \% CI: 11 \%-22 \%) and 27 \% (95 \% CI: 1 \%-54 \%) using serological tests for sheep and goats, respectively. In addition, the overall prevalence rates of T. gondii infection in sheep and goats that had abortions were 56 \% (95 \% CI: 35 \%-76 \%) and 50 \% (95 \% CI: 6 \%-94 \%), respectively. These analyses could not be performed in cattle due to the small number of studies and the small number of animals under study. According to the high prevalence of T. gondii infection in sheep and goats that had an abortion, T. gondii could be a potential factor of causing reproductive failures in ruminants worldwide. So, effective control measures and strategies are needed to reduce the rate of abortion in sheep and goats as well as reduce the economic damage to the livestock industry.},

This work conducted a systematic review, gathering and analysing research articles from PubMed and Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde databases whose results report efficacy and non-target effects of using modified insects for disease prevention, until 2016. More than 1500 publications were screened and 349 were analysed. Only 12/3.4\% articles reported field-based evidence and 41/11.7\% covered modification strategies' post-release efficacy. Variability in the effective results (90/25.7\%) questioned its reproducibility in different settings. We also found publications reporting reversal outcomes 38/10.9\%, (e.g. post-release increase of vector population). Ecological effects were also reported, such as horizontal transfer events (54/15.5\%), and worsening pathogenesis induced by natural wolbachia (10/2.9\%). Present work revealed promising outcomes of modifying strategies. However, it also revealed a need for field-based evidence mainly regarding epidemiologic and long-term impact. It pointed out some eventual irreversible and important effects that must not be ignored when considering open-field releases, and that may constitute constraints to generate the missing field evidence.

Many review papers on the chemical characterization and quantification of phlorotannins and their functionality have been published to date. However, although studies on the safety and toxicity of these phlorotannins have been conducted, there have been no articles reviewing this topic. In this review, the safety and toxicity of phlorotannins in different organisms are discussed. Online databases (Science Direct, PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web of Science) were searched, yielding 106 results. Following removal of duplicates and application of the exclusion criteria, 34 articles were reviewed. Phlorotannins from brown seaweeds showed low toxicity in cell lines, invertebrates, microalgae, seaweeds, plants, animals (fish, mice, rats, and dogs), and humans. However, the safety and toxicity of phlorotannins in aquaculture fish, livestock, and companion animals are limited. Further studies in these organisms are necessary to carry out a systematic analysis of the safety and toxicity of phlorotannins and to further identify the potential of phlorotannins as functional foods, feeds, and pharmaceuticals.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: For some time, Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACF) have incorporated animals into their environment to relieve loneliness and isolation for aged-care residents. However, research examining this practice is not as developed. This paper aims to identify the policies and practices influencing the conduct of Animal-Assisted Activities (AAA) in RACF focusing on the Australian context. METHODS: Peer-reviewed and gray literature were searched using an array of databases including CINAHL; Embase; Medline; Pubmed; Scopus and Web of Science; Google Scholar; PROSPERO, Proquest Dissertations; Theses Global; Animal Studies Repository; Medicine and Health Science Commons; Open Gray and a targeted Google search for relevant Australian Guidelines. Database searches had no time limits. Nine documents published between 1990 and 2018 were identified, appraised and subsequently included in the analysis. RESULTS: Facilities have not developed or implemented core policies; instead, there appears to be a reliance on AAA providers ensuring resident safety. Animal welfare is also identified as an emerging area, warranting further action and policy development. CONCLUSION: The requirement for effective AAA policies for RACF staff continues to be an area of need. Over the last 30 years, the development of policies guiding the provision of animal activities within RACFs has been inconsistent in both content and application, including the implementation of basic hygiene policies. If the international situation is indicative, further work is needed in Australia to develop and enforce infection control, risk management and animal welfare policies in RACF and AAA organizations.

	volume = {14},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0217420},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite Taenia solium taeniosis/cysticercosis (TSTC) having been put high on the global agenda of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), which over the last years has received a lot of attention, there has been no control programmes in place in sub-Saharan Africa, a highly endemic region. This could be attributed to lack of awareness of many stakeholders on the burden and impact of T. solium. This information is essential in guiding TSTC policies, practices and research agendas as well as encouraging cross-sectoral collaboration in the control of this important zoonotic parasite using a One Health approach. National elimination of the parasite is the foundation for global eradication. This will require that substantial country-level information is provided to all key stakeholders. We have mapped out TSTC research evidence in Tanzania to inform on disease burden and potential for integrated control measures. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A scoping review of all TSTC studies undertaken in Tanzania and published up to December 2018 was conducted. The articles were searched from PUBMED, AJOL, Google Scholar and Google in general. Fifty-one (51) articles met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Prevalence of taeniosis of 2.3\% - 5.2\% was estimated based on copro-antigen ELISA while human cysticercosis of {\textgreater}16\% was estimated based on serum antigen ELISA (Ag-ELISA) or IgG Western Blot. Neurocysticercosis (NCC) contributed significantly to epilepsy in adults. Farm prevalence of porcine cysticercosis were 6.0\% - 17.4\% (lingual examination) and 1.5\% - 33.3\% (Ag-ELISA). Slaughter-slab prevalence were 0\% - 18.2\% (routine meat inspection). Lacking latrines, watering pigs with river or pond water, and feeding pigs with potato peels were associated with porcine cysticercosis prevalence. Washing hands by dipping method increased the risk of human cysticercosis. In 2012, the number of DALYs/1000 person-years for NCC-associated epilepsy was 0.7 (95\% UI, 0.2-1.6), around 5 million USD (95\% UI, 797,535-16,933,477) were spent due to NCC-associated epilepsy and nearly 3 million USD (95\% UI, 1,095,960-5,366,038) were potentially lost due to porcine cysticercosis. Three rounds of annual treatment of school-age children with praziquantel significantly reduced prevalence of taeniosis and porcine cysticercosis. Health education was efficacious in improving knowledge and attitudes favourable for control of TSTC while a single dose of oxfendazole 30 mg/kg body weight was efficacious in eliminating T. solium cysticerci from pig musculature. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The observed high burden of TSTC and the significant contribution of NCC to epilepsy in Tanzania warrant urgent interventions. Evaluation of best control options should make use of disease transmission dynamics models such as cystiSim, taking into account findings from the field based intervention studies. In addition, locally adapted management guidelines for people suffering from NCC are urgently needed.},

It is the causative agent of Glässer's disease, causing systemic infection and polyserositis, meningitis, and arthritis. H. parasuis infection can result in high mortality and morbidity with, the significant economic losses for pig producers. To estimate the overall disease prevalence of H. parasuis in pigs from China, we performed a meta-analysis using five bibliographical databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP Chinese Journal Databases. A total of 41 articles published between 2005 and 2019, fulfilled the final inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of H. parasuis in pigs in China was 27.8 \% with the highest prevalence between 2011 and 2015 (41.0 \%). In terms of pig age, the point estimate of H. parasuis prevalence was higher in suckling piglets (29.2 \%) compared with that for other pig ages. The prevalence in the serum subgroup (29.8 \%) was higher than that in the nasal swab subgroup (12.5 \%). The results of the present meta-analysis showed that H. parasuis infection was common in pig populations in China; therefore, effective control measures are necessary to reduce this threat to pig populations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to quantify the heritability of periodontitis via a systematic appraisal of the existing evidence derived from animal studies. DESIGN: A search was conducted through the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Cochrane Library, Open Grey, Google Scholar and ResearchGate, complemented by a hand search, for studies reporting measures of heritability of periodontitis. After full-text reading, 7 studies conducted on animal models met the inclusion criteria. Six studies carried out experimental periodontitis models in mice, while one study assessed bone loss in dry skulls of baboons with known pedigrees. RESULTS: Heritability of 'naturally-occurring bone loss' (3 studies, non-experimental conditions) was estimated at 0.39 (95\% confidence interval: 0.13-0.64) with virtually no heterogeneity (I(2) = 0\%, p = 0.97). Heritability of experimental periodontitis in mice (6 studies) was 0.43 (0.28-0.58) with considerable heterogeneity (I(2) = 96\%, p {\textless} 0.01). There was no evidence of publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Over a third of the phenotypic variance of periodontitis in animal studies is due to genetic factors, somewhat higher than the estimate from human studies. It can be argued that, under the strictly-controlled experimental conditions of laboratory-induced periodontitis, the relative role of heritable factors predisposing to periodontitis and bone loss may be stronger compared with human studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mathematical transmission models are increasingly used to guide public health interventions for infectious diseases, particularly in the context of emerging pathogens; however, the contribution of modeling to the growing issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains unclear. Here, we systematically evaluate publications on population-level transmission models of AMR over a recent period (2006-2016) to gauge the state of research and identify gaps warranting further work. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of relevant databases to identify transmission studies of AMR in viral, bacterial, and parasitic disease systems. We analyzed the temporal, geographic, and subject matter trends, described the predominant medical and behavioral interventions studied, and identified central findings relating to key pathogens. RESULTS: We identified 273 modeling studies; the majority of which ({\textgreater} 70\%) focused on 5 infectious diseases (human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza virus, Plasmodium falciparum (malaria), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)). AMR studies of influenza and nosocomial pathogens were mainly set in industrialized nations, while HIV, TB, and malaria studies were heavily skewed towards developing countries. The majority of articles focused on AMR exclusively in humans (89\%), either in community (58\%) or healthcare (27\%) settings. Model systems were largely compartmental (76\%) and deterministic (66\%). Only 43\% of models were calibrated against epidemiological data, and few were validated against out-of-sample datasets (14\%). The interventions considered were primarily the impact of different drug regimens, hygiene and infection control measures, screening, and diagnostics, while few studies addressed de novo resistance, vaccination strategies, economic, or behavioral changes to reduce antibiotic use in humans and animals. CONCLUSIONS: The AMR modeling literature concentrates on disease systems where resistance has been long-established, while few studies pro-actively address recent rise in resistance in new pathogens or explore upstream strategies to reduce overall antibiotic consumption. Notable gaps include research on emerging resistance in Enterobacteriaceae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; AMR transmission at the animal-human interface, particularly in agricultural and veterinary settings; transmission between hospitals and the community; the role of environmental factors in AMR transmission; and the potential of vaccines to combat AMR.},

	abstract = {Early environments can profoundly influence an organism in ways that persist over its life. In reptiles, early thermal environments (nest temperatures) can impact offspring phenotype and survival in important ways, yet we still lack an understanding of whether general trends exist and the magnitude of impact. Understanding these patterns is important in predicting how climate change will affect reptile populations and the role of phenotypic plasticity in buffering populations. We compiled data from 175 reptile studies to examine, and quantify, the effect of incubation temperature on phenotype and survival. Using meta-analytic approaches (standardized mean difference between incubation treatments, Hedges' g), we show that across all trait types examined there is, on average, a moderate to large magnitude of effect of incubation temperatures (absolute effect: {\textbar}g{\textbar} = 0.75). Unsurprisingly, this influence was extremely large for incubation duration, as predicted, with warmer temperatures decreasing incubation time overall (g = -8.42). Other trait types, including behaviour, physiology, morphology, performance, and survival experienced reduced, but still mostly moderate to large effects, with particularly strong effects on survival. Moreover, the impact of incubation temperature persisted at least one-year post-hatching, suggesting that these effects have the potential to impact fitness in the long term. The magnitude of effect increased as the change in temperature increased (e.g. 6°C versus 2°C) in almost all cases, and tended to decrease when temperatures of the treatments fluctuated around a mean temperature compared to when they were constant. The effect also depended on the mid-temperature of the comparison, but not in consistent ways, with some traits experiencing the greatest effects at extreme temperatures, while others did not. The highly heterogeneous nature of the effects we observe, along with a large amount of unexplained variability, indicates that the shape of reaction norms between phenotype and temperature, along with ecological and/or experimental factors, are important when considering general patterns. Our analyses provide new insights into the effects of incubation environments on reptile phenotype and survival and allow general, albeit coarse, predictions for taxa experiencing warming nest temperatures under climatic change.},

We screened CAB Abstracts, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Scopus, and PubMed for original epidemiological studies that assessed pathogen-specific bacteriological cure rates of antimicrobials used to treat nonsevere clinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows. Network models were fit using risk ratios of bacteriological cure as outcome. A total of 30 studies met inclusion criteria. Comparisons of cure rates demonstrated that CIA and non-CIA had comparable efficacy for treatment of nonsevere clinical mastitis in dairy cattle. Additionally, for cows with nonsevere clinical mastitis caused by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., bacteriological cure rates were comparable for treated versus untreated cows; therefore, there was no evidence to justify treatment of these cases with CIA. Our findings supported that CIA in general are not necessary for treating nonsevere clinical mastitis in dairy cattle, the disease that accounts for the majority of antimicrobial usage in dairy herds worldwide. Furthermore, our findings support initiatives to reduce or eliminate use of CIA in dairy herds.},

Nonylphenol (NP) is a chemical compound with a nonyl group that is attached to a phenol ring. NP-induced H(2)AX is a sensitive genotoxic biomarker for detecting possible DNA damage; it also causes male infertility and carcinogenesis. We attempt to comprehensively review all the available evidence about the different ways with descriptive mechanisms for explaining the possible DNA damage that is induced by NP. We systematically searched several databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and gray literature, such as Google Scholar by using medical subheading (MeSH) terms and various combinations of selected keywords from January 1970 to August 2017. The initial search identified 62,737 potentially eligible studies; of these studies, 33 were included according to the established inclusion criteria. Thirty-three selected studies, include the topics of animal model (n = 21), cell line (n = 6), human model (n = 4), microorganisms (n = 1), solid DNA (n = 1), infertility (n = 4), apoptosis (n = 6), and carcinogenesis (n = 3). This review highlighted the possible deleterious effects of NP on DNA damage through the ability to produce ROS/RNS. Finally, it is significant to observe caution at this stage with the continued use of environmental pollutants such as NP, which may induce DNA damage and apoptosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nigella sativa or commonly known as black seed or black cumin is one of the most ubiquitous complementary medicine. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of type 2 is defined by the balance between wound healing and tissue fibrosis, which is dependent to the state of inflammation. This systematic review is conducted to provide an overview regarding the reported effect of Nigella sativa and its bioactive compound on the type 2 EMT. METHODS: A search was done in EBSCOHOST, OVID and SCOPUS database to obtain potentially relevant articles that were published between 1823 and August 2019. This review includes studies that focus on the effect of Nigella sativa and its bioactive compound on the events related to type 2 EMT. RESULTS: A total of 1393 research articles were found to be potentially related to the effect of Nigella sativa and its bioactive compound, thymoquinone on Type 2 EMT. After screening was done, 22 research articles met inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Majority of the studies, reported better wound healing rate or significant prevention of tissue inflammation and organ fibrosis following Nigella sativa or thymoquinone treatments. In terms of wound healing, studies included reported progression of EMT related pathological changes after treatment with Nigella sativa or thymoquinone. Alternatively, in terms of fibrosis and inflammation, studies included reported reversal of pathological changes related to EMT after treatment with Nigella sativa or thymoquinone. CONCLUSION: Through this review, Nigella sativa and thymoquinone have been associated with events in Type 2 EMT. They have been shown to promote wound healing, attenuate tissue inflammation, and prevent organ fibrosis via regulation of the EMT process.},

	abstract = {Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease with significant morbidity and mortality. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is an important but poorly understood complication of snakebite associated with acute kidney injury (AKI). Numerous treatments have been attempted based on limited evidence. We conducted a systematic review of TMA following snakebite using a pre-determined case definition of blood film red cell schistocytes or histologically diagnosed TMA. The search strategy included major electronic databases and grey literature. We present a descriptive synthesis for the outcomes of AKI, dialysis free survival (DFS), other end-organ damage, overall survival, and interventions with antivenom and therapeutic plasmapheresis (TPE). This study was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019121436). Seventy-two studies reporting 351 cases were included, predominantly small observational studies. Heterogeneity for study selection, design, reporting and outcomes were observed. The commonest envenoming species were hump-nosed vipers (Hypnale spp.), Russell's viper (Daboia russelii) and Australian brown snakes (Pseudechis spp.). The prevalence of TMA was at least 5.4\% in proven and probable Hypnale bites, and 10-15\% of Australian elapid envenomings, AKI occurred in 94\% (293/312) of TMA cases, excluding case reports. The majority of cases with AKI required dialysis. Included prospective and retrospective cohort studies reporting interventions and renal outcomes showed no evidence for benefit from antivenom or TPE with respect to DFS in dialysis dependant AKI. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) assessment for quality of accumulated evidence for interventions was low. The major complication of TMA following snakebite is AKI. AKI improves in most cases. We found no evidence to support benefit from antivenom in snakebite associated TMA, but antivenom remains the standard of care for snake envenoming. There was no evidence for benefit of TPE in snakebite associated TMA, so TPE cannot be recommended. The quality of accumulated evidence was low, highlighting a need for high quality larger studies.},

Nutritionally rich and with a high polyphenol content in the form of phenolic acids, flavonoids and glucosinolates, MO has been shown to exert numerous in vitro activities and in vivo effects, including hypoglycemic activity. A systematic search was carried out in the PubMed database and reference lists on the effects of MO on glucose metabolism. Thirty-three animal studies and eight human studies were included. Water and organic solvent extracts of leaves and, secondly, seeds, have been extensively assayed in animal models, showing the hypoglycemic effect, both under acute conditions and in long-term administrations and also prevention of other metabolic changes and complications associated to the hyperglycemic status. In humans, clinical trials are scarce, with variable designs and testing mainly dry leaf powder alone or mixed with other foods or MO aqueous preparations. Although the reported results are encouraging, especially those from postprandial studies, more human studies are certainly needed with more stringent inclusion criteria and a sufficient number of diabetic or prediabetic subjects. Moreover, trying to quantify the bioactive substances administered with the experimental material tested would facilitate comparison between studies.},

	abstract = {Non-invasive small animal in vivo imaging is an essential tool in a broad variety of biomedical sciences and enables continuous monitoring of disease progression in order to develop and improve diagnostic, therapeutic and preventive measures. Imaging parasites non-invasively in live animals allows efficient parasite distribution evaluation in the host organism and objective evaluation of parasitic diseases' burden and progression in individual animals. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize recent trends in small animal in vivo imaging and compare and discuss imaging of single-cell and multicellular eukaryotic parasites. A literature survey was performed using Web of Science and PubMed databases in research articles published between 1990 and 2018. The inclusion criteria were using any imaging method to visualize a range of protozoan and helminth parasites in laboratory animals in vivo. A total of 92 studies met our inclusion criteria. Protozoans and helminths were imaged in 88\% and 12\% of 92 studies, respectively. The most common parasite genus studied was the protozoan Plasmodium followed by Trypanosoma and Leishmania. The most frequent imaging method was bioluminescence. Among the helminths, Schistosoma and Echinococcus were the most studied organisms. In vivo imaging is applicable in both protozoans and helminths. In helminths, however, the use of in vivo imaging methods is limited to some extent. Imaging parasites in small animal models is a powerful tool in preclinical research aiming to develop novel therapeutic and preventive strategies for parasitic diseases of interest both in human and veterinary medicine.},

	abstract = {Osteoporosis is considered a silent disease, the early symptoms of which often go unrecognised. Osteoporosis causes bone loss, reduces mineralised density, and inevitably leads to bone fracture. Hormonal deficiencies due to aging or drug induction are also frequently attributed to osteoporosis. Nevertheless, the phytochemical content of natural plants has been proven to significantly reduce osteoporotic conditions. A systematic review was conducted by this study to identify research specifically on the effects of Malaysian herbs such as Piper sarmentosum, Eurycoma longifolia and Labisia pumila on osteoporotic bone changes. This review consisted of a comprehensive search of five databases for the effects of specific herbs on osteoporotic bone change. These databases were Web of Science (WOS), Medline, Scopus, ScienceDirect and PubMed. The articles were selected throughout the years, were limited to the English language and fully documented. Duplication, irrelevant titles, different herbs and in vitro studies were excluded, including those that are not original research papers. A total of 399 potential studies were identified, but only 21 samples were accepted based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Six of the twenty one studies were on Piper sarmentosum, six on Eurycoma longifolia, and the remaining nine studies were on Labisia pumila. Overall, in three of the studies a glucocorticoidinduced model was used, while in 12 of the studies an ovariectomised model was used, and for the other six studies an orchidectomised model was used as the osteoporotic model. All of the studies reported varied results based on the type of herbs used, but in comparison to Eurycoma longifolia, Piper sarmentosum and Labisia pumila recorded better anti-osteoporotic effects, while the majority of studies on Eurycoma longifolia were unable to preserve bone strength.},

	abstract = {Dairy production systems rely on row crop agriculture to produce feed because animal density continues to rise, whereas land allocated to dairy farms is decreasing. Management of the entire dairy system, including animals, forages, and manure, must be optimized to meet production goals while remaining economically viable. Many producers apply dairy manure to meet crop nutrient demand, both reducing the need for synthetic fertilizer and the cost associated with manure disposal. However, repeated manure applications have been linked with environmental concerns, such as soil nutrient loading, increased greenhouse gas emissions, and decreased water quality. The objective of this research was to synthesize the literature comparing dairy manure fertilizer with synthetic fertilizer in row crop agricultural production systems to determine impacts on both crop productivity and environmental quality. Fifty-eight studies were included in a meta-analysis that showed that, when applied at rates providing comparable levels of plant-available N, manure fertilizer matched synthetic fertilizer in crop production, quality, and digestibility. Manure application increased soil organic matter, which may have an overall positive effect on long-term soil fertility, but it also increased soil P, suggesting a threat to water quality. Soil nitrate leaching and nitrous oxide emissions were highly variable across studies, so no clear trends were evident. Overall, these findings suggest that manure is a suitable fertilizer in row crop agriculture, but it should be applied with caution to limit risk to environmental quality, which can vary with site-specific factors like climate, soil texture, and application practices.},

We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis of studies assessing the comparative efficacy of vaccines to control BRD when administered to beef cattle at or near their arrival at the feedlot. We searched MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Daily Epub Ahead of Print, AGRICOLA, Cambridge Agricultural and Biological Index, Science Citation Index, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science and hand-searched the conference proceedings of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners and World Buiatrics Congress. We found 53 studies that reported BRD morbidity within 45 days of feedlot arrival. The largest connected network of studies, which involved 17 vaccine protocols from 14 studies, was included in the meta-analysis.

The outcome of interest was the diagnosis of BRD within 45 days of arrival at the feedlot. The network meta-analysis included data from 46 studies and 167 study arms identified in the review. The results suggest that macrolides are the most effective antibiotics for the reduction of BRD incidence. Injectable oxytetracycline effectively controlled BRD compared with no antibiotics; however, it was less effective than macrolide treatment. Because oxytetracycline is already commonly used to prevent, control, and treat BRD in groups of feedlot cattle, the use of injectable oxytetracycline for BRD control might have advantages from an antibiotic stewardship perspective.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the exposure-dependent efficacy thresholds of vancomycin have been probed, less is known about acute kidney injury (AKI) thresholds for this drug. Sensitive urinary biomarkers, such as kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), have shown high sensitivity and specificity for vancomycin-associated AKI. The aims of the study were to determine if there were dose-response curves with urinary KIM-1, and to evaluate the impact of therapy duration and sex on observed relationships. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted via PubMed/MEDLINE. Data were compiled from preclinical studies that reported individual subject data for urinary KIM-1 concentrations, vancomycin dose (mg/kg), duration of treatment, and sex. Sigmoidal Hill-type models were fit to the individual dose-response data. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies were identified, 6 of which reported vancomycin dose and KIM-1 data. Of these, three included individual animal-level data suitable for analysis. For all pooled rats, increasing total daily vancomycin doses displayed a dose-response curve with urinary KIM-1 concentrations (50\% maximal toxic response=130.4 mg/kg/day). Dose-response curves were shifted left for females vs. males (P = 0.05) and for long (i.e. ≥7 days) vs. short (i.e. {\textless}4 days) duration of vancomycin therapy (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The collective findings demonstrate a clear dose-response relationship between vancomycin dose and AKI. As these analyses focused exclusively on dose-response relationships, additional preclinical data are needed to more clearly define vancomycin exposures that predict the onset of AKI.},

	abstract = {Over the last two decades, the pig population in Africa has grown rapidly, reflecting the increased adoption of pig production as an important economic activity. Of all species, pigs are likely to constitute a greater share of the growth in the livestock subsector. However, constraints such as respiratory infectious diseases cause significant economic losses to the pig industry worldwide. Compared to industrialized countries, the occurrence and impacts of respiratory diseases on pig production in Africa is under-documented. Hence, knowledge on prevalence and incidence of economically important swine respiratory pathogens in pigs in Africa is necessary to guide interventions for prevention and control. The purpose of this review was to document the current status of research on five important respiratory pathogens of swine in Africa to inform future research and interventions. The pathogens included were porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PPRSv), porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyopneumoniae), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) and swine influenza A viruses (IAV). For this review, published articles were obtained using Harzing's Publish or Perish software tool from GoogleScholar. Articles were also sourced from PubMed, ScienceDirect, FAO and OIE websites. The terms used for the search were Africa, swine or porcine, respiratory pathogens, M. hyopneumoniae, APP, PCV2, PPRSv, IAV, prevention and control. In all, 146 articles found were considered relevant, and upon further screening, only 85 articles were retained for the review. The search was limited to studies published from 2000 to 2019. Of all the studies that documented occurrence of the five respiratory pathogens, most were on IAV (48.4\%, n = 15), followed by PCV2 (25.8\%, n = 8), PPRSv (19.4\%, n = 6), while only one study (3.2\%, n = 1) reported APP and M. hyopneumoniae. This review highlights knowledge and information gaps on epidemiologic aspects as well as economic impacts of the various pathogens reported in swine in Africa, which calls for further studies.},

	abstract = {Cue-induced reinstatement is a widely used model for investigating relapse of reward-seeking behavior with high face validity in relation to clinical observations. Yet, face validity is not sufficient to evaluate an animal model, and quantitative, evidence-based analysis is required to estimate the ultimate applicability of this paradigm. Furthermore, such analysis would allow an accurate and reproducible design of future experiments. Here, we conducted meta-analysis and cluster analysis to characterize the impact of cue type (visual, auditory, olfactory or combinations thereof), intensity (e.g. light frequency, sound volume and odor concentration), reward type (e.g. different drugs of abuse, sucrose and food pellets) and model parameters (e.g. housing condition, age, gender and strain of animals) on reinstatement levels. We selected 184 publications for meta-analysis based on inclusion criteria with a total number of 3889 rats. Our analysis suggested that the exact level of reinstatement depends on neither cue type, nor intensity nor on the type of reward. While all cues induced reinstatement to reward-seeking behavior, it is the model parameters, in particular, the housing conditions, age and strain, that defined the final reinstatement levels. In particular, single-housed, adolescent, Wistar or Lister Hooded rats showed significantly higher reinstatement than adult, Sparague-Dawley rats housed in groups. Our findings suggest that model parameters (for example, single housing) evoke stress-induced behaviors that affect reinstatement more than cue/reward factors.},

However, lateralization in many predator species is not well understood and existing studies often are statistically underpowered due to small sample sizes and they moreover show conflicting results. Here, we statistically integrated findings on paw preferences in cats and dogs, two predator species within the Carnivora order that are commonly kept as pets in many societies around the globe. For both species, there were significantly more lateralized than non-lateralized animals. We found that 78\% of cats and 68\% of dogs showed either left- or right-sided paw preference. Unlike humans, neither dogs nor cats showed a rightward paw preference on the population level. For cats, but not dogs, we found a significant sex difference, with female animals having greater odds of being right-lateralized compared to male animals.},

Two independent raters with a structured tool for rating the research quality critically assessed the articles. Although the small number of studies limits the conclusions, the current literature research indicates that photobiomodulation therapy can be an effective short-term approach to accelerate the healing process of third-degree burns, to increase and modulate the inflammatory process, to accelerate the proliferation of fibroblasts, and to enhance the quality of the collagen network.

This systematic review aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of apheresis in the treatment of these conditions. METHODS: MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE and CINAHL databases were searched to identify studies published between January 1969 and March 2018 involving patients treated using apheresis for severe falciparum malaria, loiasis or babesiosis. Data extracted included details about the apheresis intervention, populations, study methods and outcomes relating to efficacy and safety. RESULTS: A total of 67 publications met the inclusion criteria and were included in the data synthesis, 36 for malaria (70 cases), 17 for babesiosis (22 cases) and 14 for loiasis (34 cases). Publications were case reports, case series, and cohort studies; there were no randomised controlled trials identified. Potential publication bias was considered to be high. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic review of the literature suggests that apheresis may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of patients hospitalised for babesiosis, and prior to chemotherapy in loiasis with microfilarial count {\textgreater}8000 parasites/mL.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: African animal trypanosomiasis is an economically significant disease that affects the livestock industry in Nigeria. It is caused by several parasites of the genus Trypanosoma. National estimates of the disease prevalence in livestock and tsetse flies are lacking, therefore a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to understand the trend of the disease prevalence over the years. METHODS: Publications were screened in Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, Global Health, EMBASE and PubMed databases. Using four-stage (identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion) process in the PRIMSA checklist, only studies that met the inclusion criteria for AAT and tsetse infections were analysed. Point estimates prevalence and subgroup analyses based on diagnostic techniques in livestock were evaluated at 95\% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 74 eligible studies published between 1960 and 2017 were selected for meta-analysis. This covers the six geopolitical zones, involving a total of 53,924 animals. The overall prevalence of AAT was 16.1\% (95\% CI: 12.3-20.3\%). Based on diagnostic techniques, the prevalence of AAT in cattle was highest in PCR followed by serology and microscopy while the highest prevalence in pigs was observed with serology. Out of 12,552 tsetse flies examined from 14 eligible studies, an overall prevalence of 17.3\% (95\% CI: 4.5-36.0\%) and subgroup prevalence of 49.7\% (95\% CI: 30.7-68.8\%), 11.5\% (95\% CI: 6.1-18.5) and 4.5\% (95\% CI: 1.8-8.8\%) in G. morsitans, G. tachinoides and G. palpalis, respectively, were observed using the random effects-model. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of trypanosomes in both vectors and animal hosts was high in Nigeria. Therefore, further research on risk factors, seasonal and transhumance effects, vectoral capacity and competence are warranted for an effective control of AAT in Nigeria.},

The high report of C. parvum subtype family IIc indicates the importance of anthroponotic transmission of Cryptosporidium in Nigeria. Heterogeneity of subgroup (regions, species) and risk factors (HIV status, age, gender, faecal type) analyses were determined. The pooled prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. in different hosts were high and linked with several risk factors such as environmental contamination and animal contact.

The continental estimates of parasitic diseases among visited wildlife-tourists and mammalian wildlife present in conservation areas are lacking; therefore, a general review was necessary to provide insights into Africa's parasitic disease burden and transmission between humans and wildlife. A two-step analysis was conducted with searches in Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science and Global Health. All diseases reported without prevalence were grouped and analysed as categorical data while meta-analysis of prevalence rates of parasitic diseases in wildlife from national parks and reserves in Africa was conducted. Only 4.7\% of the tourist centres reported routine wildlife diagnosis for parasitic diseases. Disease intensity shows that cryptosporidiosis and seven other parasitic diseases were observed in both human and wildlife; however, no significant difference in intensity between human and wildlife hosts was observed. Schistosomiasis intensity reports showed a significant increase (P {\textless} 0.05) while entamoebiasis showed a significant decrease (P {\textless} 0.05) in humans as compared to wildlife. Visiting tourists were more infected with malaria, while wildlife was more infected with parasitic gastroenteritis (PGE). The meta-analysis of wildlife revealed the highest prevalence of PGE with mixed parasites and lowest prevalence of Giardia spp. at 99.9 and 5.7\%, respectively. The zoonotic and socioeconomic impact of some of these parasites could pose a severe public threat to tourism. Pre- and post-travel clinical examinations are important for tourists while routine examination, treatment and rational surveillance are important for these animals to improve wildlife tourism.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lameness in dairy cows has been an ongoing concern of great relevance to animal welfare and productivity in modern dairy production. Many studies have examined associations between various factors related to housing, management, and the individual animal and the occurrence of lameness. The objective of this systematic review was to answer the research question "what are risk factors associated with lameness in dairy cows that are housed in free stall barns or tie stall facilities". Furthermore, we performed a synthesis of current evidence on certain risk factors by means of a meta-analysis to illustrate the strength of their association with bovine lameness. RESULTS: Following pre-defined procedures and inclusion criteria in accordance with the PRISMA statement, two observers independently included 53 articles out of a pool of 1941 articles which had been retrieved by a broad literature research in a first step. 128 factors that have been associated with lameness were identified in those papers. Meta-analyses were conducted for five factors presented in six different studies: Body condition score, presence of claw overgrowth, days in milk, herd size, and parity. Results indicated that a body condition score of ≤2.5/5 is associated with increased odds of lameness. A higher risk of being lame was found for the presence of claw overgrowth, the first 120 days in milk, larger herd sizes, and increasing parity. Throughout the study, we encountered profound difficulties in retrieving data and information of sufficient quality from primary articles as well as in recovering comparable studies. CONCLUSIONS: We learned that an abundance of literature on bovine lameness exists. To adequately address a problem of this importance to both animal welfare and economic viability, solid evidence is required in the future to develop effective intervention strategies. Therefore, a consistent working definition of lameness and specific risk factors should be an option to consider.},

Data collected were analysed in OpenMEE software and pooled estimation revealed that turmeric-based diets significantly reduced the concentrations of TC and LDL-c (p{\textless}0.01), and improved the concentrations of HDL-c (p{\textless}0.01) in chicken blood when compared to those on the control diets. Sub-analysis found significant associations between covariates (chicken strain, supplementation level, number of birds per treatment and duration of supplementation) and measured outcomes (TC, HDL-c and LDL-c). Significant heterogeneity (I 2) existed in the meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis found that chicken strain and duration of supplementation were predictors of HDL-c and LDL-c, and explained 72\% of the sources of heterogeneity among the studies used in the meta-analysis.

	abstract = {Nutritional strategies that improve growth performance indices in chickens without increasing feed consumption are desirable considering the escalating feed cost. The use of spices to maintain health and increase productivity in livestock and poultry has been documented. However, a consensus has not been attained whether ginger, one of such spices, improves productivity in poultry. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to ascertain the effect of ginger administration on chicken performance. We searched AGORA, Scopus, Science Direct and Google Scholar for papers published in English using Boolean operators, proximity searching, wildcard and alternate spelling. Selected criteria were randomized and control trials with chickens, studies published in peer-reviewed journals, reported at least one presentation form of ginger and outcomes of interest and a measure of dispersion (standard deviation or p value). Twenty-one papers that satisfy the selection criteria were employed to determine the impact of ginger on feed intake, body weight gain (BWG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), organ weight, semen parameters and total serum lipid (triglyceride and cholesterol) content using Open Meta-analyst for Ecology and Evolution software. A positive relationship was found between ginger and semen quality in chickens. Ginger administration improved BWG (Hedges' d, d = 0.495; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.041-0.949; p = 0.033) and FCR (d = - 0.732; 95\% CI - 1.195 to - 0.270; p = 0.002) taking cognizance of publication bias and heterogeneity. Restricted subgroup analysis showed there is a positive association between ginger powder and FCR (d = - 0.732; 95\% CI = 1.195 to - 0.270; p = 0.002). Meta-regression revealed that covariates (duration of administration, dietary form, inclusion level and strain) explained most of the heterogeneity. The occurrence of variations and publication bias does not pose a major problem in this study since a relatively large number of unpublished studies will be needed to change significant impacts. In conclusion, meta-analytical results suggest enhanced performance in chickens on different levels of ginger administration.},

	abstract = {The aim of the study is to use meta-analytical procedure to resolve uncertainty, identify knowledge gaps, and create new insights using published data on the phytobiotic effect of dietary pepper intervention on daily feed intake (DFI), average daily gain (ADG), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) in broiler chickens. The authors accessed AGORA, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases for primary studies published between 2011 and 2018 using combinations of different search terms. Fifteen studies were included to assess phytobiotic effect of pepper on DFI, FCR, and ADG in broiler chickens. Random-effects model (REM) was used to generate pooled effect estimates at 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Analysis was performed using Open Meta-analyst for Ecology and Evolution (OpenMEE) software, while publication bias and source of heterogeneity were assessed using standard methods. Dietary pepper supplementation enhanced ADG (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.576, 95\% CI 0.444 to 0.707, p {\textless} 0.001) and FCR (SMD = 0.325, 95\% CI - 0.453 to - 0.196, p {\textless} 0.001) considering the presence of heterogeneity and publication bias. DFI (SMD = 0.052, 95\%CI - 0.069 to 0.173, p = 0.403) was not significantly influenced by dietary pepper supplementation. Restricted subgroup analysis revealed that both black and red pepper increased ADG (p {\textless} 0.001). Broilers on black pepper intervention had better FCR (p = 0.002) than broilers on red pepper treatment. Higher (p {\textless} 0.05) DFI was obtained on broilers fed pepper-based diet at the rate of {\textgreater} 6 g/kg feed for 35 days. There was no association between DFI and explanatory variables (broiler strain used and number of broilers used), whereas study country influenced DFI (p {\textless} 0.001). Furthermore, there was an association between outcome of interests (ADG and FCR) and explanatory variables (supplementation level, study country, number of broilers used per treatment group, and broiler strain used). Broilers on dietary pepper intervention for 42 days had higher ADG (SMD = 62.2 g/bird/day, p {\textless} 0.001) than those on dietary pepper intervention for 56 days (SMD = 35.7 g/bird/day, p = 0.002). There is evidence of heterogeneity, and meta-regression analysis showed that study country, supplementation level, and broiler strain used explained most of the sources of heterogeneity. The results of the present study revealed the potential of dietary pepper intervention to improve production efficiency in broiler chickens. The current meta-analysis also set the steps for standardized experimental designs on the use of dietary pepper intervention in broiler feeding trials in the future.},

	abstract = {The potential of phytobiotics, also referred phytogenics or botanical to improve animal productivity has been highlighted. However, consensus has not been reached on the use of garlic, one of such phytobiotics to boost productivity of laying hens . The objectives of this meta-analysis were to assess the effectiveness of supplementation with garlic on feed intake (FI), feed conversion ratio (FCR), hen day egg production (HDEP) and egg quality attributes of lay hens. Databases [Scopus, Google scholar, and Access to Global Online Research in Agriculture (AGORA)] were searched for peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English. Criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis were information on moderators (breed, preparation form of garlic, treatment duration, age of hen at the beginning of garlic intervention, country where the study was performed, number of chickens included in the study, inclusion level of garlic), an adequate description of randomization, egg production and egg quality data, and associated measures of variance such as standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE) and P - values. Nineteen (19) out of 53 research papers met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. All analyses were conducted using the Open Meta-analyst for Ecology and Evolution (OpenMEE) software. Overall pooled results revealed that garlic supplementation increased HDEP by 0.322\% [95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.211 to 0.432], egg mass by 0.486 g/day/hen [95\% CI = 0.163 to 0.810], egg weight by 0.069 g [95\% CI = 0.001 to 0.136], egg shell thickness by 0.259 mm [95\% CI = 0.160 to 0.358] and egg shell weight by 0.219 g [95\% CI = 0.087 to 0.350] relative to controls, taking cognizance of publication bias and heterogeneity. Chickens fed diets with or without garlic had comparable FCR. Results suggest that there was no evidence of treatment effect on FI and Haugh unit . Subgroup analysis found that studies that used garlic extract had significant egg weight while studies that used garlic powder and oil had similar egg weight. Meta-regression analysis showed that study country, breed, hen's age, garlic preparation form, inclusion level of garlic, number of hens included in the study and treatment duration were predictors of the study effect. The results of this meta-analysis revealed that layers on dietary garlic supplementation had significantly increased HDEP, egg mass, egg weight, eggshell thickness and eggshell weight compared to controls, although the egg production data for the layers (both treatment and control groups) of specific age, breeds, strain and lines used for the analysis were within their respective target data.},

	abstract = {Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a worldwide zoonosis, is highly prevalent in Africa particularly in northern and eastern Africa where data are more abundant than other regions. However, harmonization of available data through systematic review and meta-analysis may foster improved transboundary cooperation for the control of CE in Africa. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines, research articles (from 2000 to 2019) were retrieved from ScienceDirect, PubMed, African Journals OnLine and Google Scholar databases. A total of 98 studies of 806,624 animals from 13 countries comprising 264,016 goats, 247,326 sheep, 251,106 cattle, 28,314 camels, 4,764 buffaloes, 2,920 equids, 1,966 pigs, 408 wild boars and 50 Norway rats were available for systematic review and meta-analysis of pooled prevalence including 5,048 dogs, 345 lions, 220 hyenas, 94 wolves and 47 jackals/foxes analysed for Echinococcus infection. In total, 46,869 animals were infected and pooled prevalence of CE in intermediate hosts was highest in camels (17.1\%; 95\% CI: 12.1-22.8) and lowest in pigs (0.3\%; 95\% CI: 0.1-0.6). Results also showed uneven species/genotype distribution across the continent such that Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (G1, G3) constituted 74.45\% of the total isolates from East Africa, E. canadensis (G6/7) accounted for 60.3\% and 97.4\% in North and West Africa, respectively, while 81.3\% of E. ortleppi (G5) were recorded for southern Africa. The comparatively higher prevalence estimates for eastern and northern Africa than other regions indicate where efforts on CE management should now be given greater attention in Africa. Additionally, this study also advocates for better cooperation between countries within the same sub-region and the establishment of joint CE control programmes.},

	abstract = {Consistent quantification of trypanosomes, the parasite responsible for African animal trypanosomosis, is important for effective surveillance, control, and eradication strategies. Here, we used a rigorously predefined protocol to search and select eligible publications that utilized either microscopy, serology, or molecular methods to investigate prevalence of trypanosomosis based on the presence of any of three most common Trypanosoma spp. (T. congolense, T. vivax, and T. brucei) in the field-based naturally grazed Gambian cattle, sheep, and goats. To combine results of studies on cattle through meta-analysis, sensitivity and subgroup analyses were carried out with the random effects model, and prevalence estimates of each study with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were presented with a forest plot. All the eligible studies utilized the buffy coat technique (BCT) to detect trypanosomes in the blood samples, while the more sensitive serological and molecular detection methods are yet to be widely exploited. Heterogeneity among the studies on cattle was moderate (I(2) = 55\%), and the pooled trypanosomosis prevalence based on the BCT was 5.2\% (95\% CI: 4.0-6.4). Meanwhile, estimated prevalence varied according to the trypanosome detection methods, study locations, types of publication, year, and length of observations. We could not pool the trypanosomosis prevalence in sheep and goats through meta-analysis due to small number of studies. The prevalence estimates based on the BCT ranged from 3.2 to 8.1\% in goats and 2.8 to 10.6\% in sheep. Even though there seems to be a slight decrease in trypanosomosis prevalence in cattle in one of the Gambian districts, there was no consistent trend across the years. It is thought that the literature search and formatting procedures presented in this study contribute to doing systematic reviews on the investigated subject and can be adapted for similar cases.},

	abstract = {High ambient temperatures are a challenge for animal production around the world, and they are one of the major reasons for economic and productive losses in pig production. Under stress conditions, the energy contribution to productive functions is reduced, generating health imbalances, decreased productivity rates and changes in animal behavior. Despite the numerous articles published on this subject, the variability of results on performance parameters is high. For this reason, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the actual impact of high ambient temperature (HAT) (29 degrees C to 35 degrees C) on growing-finishing pig performance, compared with animals kept in a thermoneutral environment (TNT) (18 degrees C to 25 degrees C), based on meta-analysis. Data on average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (FI) and feed gain ratio (F:G) were extracted from 22 (n=22) papers published in scientific journals. The values were analyzed using an expansion of the t-test, considering the random effect of each study. Results showed that HAT reduced the values of ADG (654.38 vs 595.81 g/d) and FI (2.141 vs 1.875 g/d) when compared with the thermoneutral group. There was no statistical difference between the F:G values for both groups. In conclusion, high ambient temperatures negatively influence performance parameters of growing-finishing pigs when compared with those in thermoneutral conditions.},

This vector-borne zoonosis occurs in Eastern and Southeastern Asia and an intentional or inadvertent introduction into the United States (US) would have major public health and economic consequences. The objective of this study was to gather, appraise, and synthesize primary research literature to identify and quantify vector and host competence for JEV, using a systematic review (SR) of the literature. After defining the research question, we performed a search in selected electronic databases and journals. The title and abstract of the identified articles were screened for relevance using a set of exclusion and inclusion criteria, and relevant articles were subjected to a risk of bias assessment, followed by data extraction. Data were extracted from 171 peer-reviewed articles. Most studies were observational studies (59.1\%) and reported vector competence (60.2\%). The outcome measures reported pertained to transmission efficiency, host preference, and vector susceptibility to infection within vector competence; and susceptibility to infection within host competence. Regarding vector competence, the proportion of JEV infection reported across all 149 mosquito species in all observational studies ranged from 0 to 100\%. In experimental studies, infection, dissemination, and transmission rates varied between 0 and 100\%. Minimum infection rates (MIR) varied between 0 and 333.3 per 1000 mosquitoes. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) values ranged from 0 to 53.8 per 1000 mosquitoes. The host species in which mosquitoes mostly fed consisted of pigs and cattle (total of 84 blood meals taken by mosquitoes from each of these host species). As for host competence, the proportion of JEV infection varied between 0 (in rabbits, reptiles, and amphibians) and 88.9\% (cattle). This SR presents comprehensive data on JEV vector and host competence, which can be used to quantify risks associated with the introduction of JEV into the US.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: In the present study, we described the most prevalent clinical symptoms, the most affected organs, and the macro and microscopic lesions associated with cutaneous leishmaniasis. METHODS: Two independent researchers performed an extensive systematic review of the literature in four stages (identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion) to identify studies published between January 2002 and November 2018 from the following electronic databases: Web of Science, PubMed, SciELO, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. Meta-analysis was conducted in "Metaprop" package of R 3.4.2 software. RESULTS: The electronic search yielded 3896 results, out of which 155 were further analyzed based on the full-text. Data extracted from 16 articles were included in the meta-analysis, representing a total of 430 leishmaniasis cases. Only 43\% of all animals were identified to exhibit the clinical and cutaneous changes characteristic of leishmaniasis based on the observation that skin lesions were the most prevalent clinical sign and were present in 86\% of all cases. Other less prevalent symptoms included weight loss, cachexia, apathy and lymph node enlargement. Histopathological analysis showed that the skin was the most affected organ, affecting 64\% of cases, followed by lymph nodes (12\%), spleen (8\%) and liver (7\%). CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, our current findings suggest that cutaneous leishmaniasis could lead to visceral disease. Notably, our findings indicated no clinical manifestation patterns in cutaneous leishmaniasis, since the same host species may present different clinical conditions.},

Objective This systematic review aims to summarize the natural products used in treatment of experimental models of TMD. Methodology A systematic search was performed in the databases Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, SciELO, LILACS, and Scholar Google databases in January 2020, dating from their inception. Pre-clinical studies with natural products for intervention in experimental TMD were included. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, extracted the data, and evaluated the risk of bias. Results 17 records were selected, and 17 different natural products were found, including three lectins, three plants or algae extracts, three sulfated polysaccharides, three cocoa preparations, and five isolated compounds. Concerning the risk of bias, most studies lacked on randomization and blinding. Nociception induced by phlogistic agents was evaluated in most articles, and in five studies it was associated with analysis of inflammatory parameters. In order to investigate the mechanism of action of the natural products used, eight studies evaluated expression of neural or glial molecular markers. Conclusions 16 of 17 natural products found in this review presented positive results, showing their potential for treatment of TMD. However, the lack of methodological clarity can influence these results.},

	abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Salt-tolerant plants are well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Mediterranean region, where have been used traditionally as food and medicines for human and animals. In addition, various species are currently recognized as sources of metabolites with pharmacological, cosmetical and nutraceutical interest. Nevertheless, ethnoveterinary data on salt-tolerant plants are dispersed in the literature and there are few discussions on its veterinary potential. Having in mind the rising interest on organic farming, alternatives to chemical substances in livestock production and concern for animal health and welfare practices, these plants may represent an untapped resource for animal management and veterinary purposes. In this sense, the purpose of this work is to summarize the ethnoveterinary knowledge on salt-tolerant plants described in the Mediterranean region, raising awareness to the potential of this group of plants to be used in veterinary science, targeting especially ruminants. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Literature search (2000-2020) was conducted using Web of Science and Science Direct databases. Ethnoveterinary reports (EVR) concerning salt-tolerant plants were summarized and filtered for ruminants. From the final 29 publications, EVR concerning therapeutic uses were categorized according to its ATCvet code and results analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 221 EVR were identified from 39 plants, belonging to 21 plant families, targetting ruminants. Ten EVR (4.5\%) concerned uses of salt-tolerant species as animal feed, while around 75\% of therapeutic uses was represented by three categories: alimentary tract and metabolism (QA; n = 75), dermatologicals (QD; n = 53) and genitourinary system and sex hormones (QG; n = 41). Pistacia lentiscus L., Foeniculum vulgare Mill., Dittrichia viscosa (L.) Greuter, Plantago major L. and Hordeum vulgare L. were the most cited species in the latter categories. CONCLUSIONS: The ethnoveterinary knowledge on salt-tolerant species hints some plants of veterinary pharmacological potential, but other species deserve further notice. This information should serve as a basis and, coupled with the currently available scientific data on bioactive properties and chemical composition of salt-tolerant species, inspire additional research on the exploitation of this botanical group, as sources of novel products for ruminant nutrition, health and quality of its products.},

Widespread resistance to synthetic anthelminthics has stimulated the research for alternative strategies of parasite control, including the use of medicinal plants. The present work summarizes the in vitro and in vivo studies of plants with activity against GIN of goats, focusing on the description of chemical constituents related to this effect. This review retrieved 56 scientific articles from 2008 to 2018 describing more than 100 different plant species. The most frequently investigated family was Fabaceae (30.7\%). Most in vitro studies on the activity of plant extracts and fractions were carried out with of free-living stages nematodes. In vivo studies were conducted mainly with the use of plants in animal feed and generally showed lower effectiveness compared to in vitro assays. The main plant secondary metabolites associated with anthelmintic effect are condensed tannins, saponin and flavonoids. However, the studies with compounds isolated from plants and elucidation of their mechanisms of action are scarce. Herbal medicines are thought to be promising sources for the development of effective anthelmintic agents.},

In response, member countries agreed to pay greater attention to the surveillance and implementation of antimicrobial stewardship. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control called for a review of AMR in Nigeria using a \&ldquo;One Health approach\&rdquo;. As anecdotal evidence suggests that food animal health and production rely heavily on antimicrobials, it becomes imperative to understand AMR trends in food animals and the environment. We reviewed previous studies to curate data and evaluate the contributions of food animals and the environment (2000⁻2016) to the AMR burden in Nigeria using a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flowchart focused on three areas: Antimicrobial resistance, residues, and antiseptics studies. Only one of the 48 antimicrobial studies did not report multidrug resistance. At least 18 bacterial spp. were found to be resistant to various locally available antimicrobials. All 16 residue studies reported high levels of drug residues either in the form of prevalence or concentration above the recommended international limit. Fourteen different \&ldquo;resistotypes\&rdquo; were found in some commonly used antiseptics. High levels of residues and AMR were found in food animals destined for the human food chain. High levels of residues and antimicrobials discharged into environments sustain the AMR pool. These had evolved into potential public health challenges that need attention. These findings constitute public health threats for Nigeria\&rsquo;s teeming population and require attention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Toxoplasma gondii is an important foodborne zoonotic parasite. Meat of infected animals is presumed to constitute a major source of human infection and may be a driver of geographical variation in the prevalence of anti-T. gondii antibodies in humans, which is substantial in the Nordic-Baltic region in northern Europe. However, data on seroprevalence of T. gondii in different animal species used for human consumption are scattered. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of seroprevalence studies and meta-analysis to estimate the seroprevalence of T. gondii in five animal species that are raised or hunted for human consumption in the Nordic-Baltic region: domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), sheep (Ovis aries), cattle (Bos taurus), wild boars (Sus scrofa), and moose (Alces alces). We searched for studies that were conducted between January 1990 and June 2018, and reported in articles, theses, conference abstracts and proceedings, and manuscripts. Subgroup analyses were performed to identify variables influencing the seroprevalence. FINDINGS: From a total of 271 studies identified in the systematic review, 32 were included in the meta-analysis. These comprised of 13 studies on domestic pigs, six on sheep, three on cattle, six on wild boars, and four on moose. The estimated pooled seroprevalence of T. gondii was 6\% in domestic pigs (CI(95\%): 3-10\%), 23\% in sheep (CI(95\%): 12-36\%), 7\% in cattle (CI(95\%): 1-21\%), 33\% in wild boars (CI(95\%): 26-41\%), and 16\% in moose (CI(95\%): 10-23\%). High heterogeneity was observed in the seroprevalence data within each species. In all host species except wild boars, the pooled seroprevalence estimates were significantly higher in animals {\textgreater}1 year of age than in younger animals. Not all studies provided information on animal age, sensitivity and specificity of the serological method employed, and the cut-off values used for defining an animal seropositive. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of animals raised or hunted for human consumption in the region had tested positive for T. gondii. This indicates widespread exposure to T. gondii among animals raised or hunted for human consumption in the region. Large variations were observed in the seroprevalence estimates between the studies in the region; however, studies were too few to identify spatial patterns at country-level.},

References were screened and selected based on predefined eligibility criteria by two independent reviewers, according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Clinical outcomes were assessed quantitatively using clinical pain scores, physical examination, imaging examination, questionnaire responses, pain in manipulation, gait analysis, range of joint motion, and adverse effects. The risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist. Out of 1483 articles, six met the inclusion criteria for qualitative analysis, with two randomized controlled trials and four before-and-after studies. All studies reported significantly better clinical outcomes in the adipose tissue stem cells (ADSC) group with improvements in pain and function and decreased evidence of hip OA. The risk of bias was categorized as high in the before-and-after studies and moderate to high in the randomized studies. The studies were considered heterogeneous owing to clinical results and methodology. Because of this heterogeneity, it was not possible to perform meta-analysis. Assessments of ADSC reports yielded positive clinical effects that showed improvements in pain and function and decreased evidence of hip osteoarthritis.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The changes in bone homeostasis observed during pregnancy and lactation could result in alterations in the rate of orthodontic tooth movement, but research in human subjects presents significant ethical and practical limitations. Our aim was to compare the amount of orthodontic tooth movement between pregnant/lactating or not animals. METHODS: We searched without restrictions 8 databases and performed hand searching until July 2019 (PubMed, Central, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Arab World Research Source, ClinicalTrials.gov , ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global). We searched for studies comparing quantitatively the amount of orthodontic tooth movement between pregnant/lactating or not animals. Following retrieval and selection of studies, the collection of related data was performed and the risk of bias was assessed using the SYRCLE's Risk of Bias Tool. Exploratory synthesis was carried out using the random effects model. RESULTS: Four studies were finally identified raising no specific concerns regarding bias. One study showed that lactation increased the rate of tooth movement by 50 \% [p {\textless} 0.05]. Although an overall increase was noted in the pregnancy group as well, it did not reach statistical significance [3 studies, Weighted Mean Difference: 0.10; 95\% Confidence Interval: - 0.04 - 0.24; p = 0.165]. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic changes occurring during pregnancy and lactation may have an impact on the rate of tooth movement in animals. Although these animal experimental results should be approached cautiously, it could be safe practice to consider the impact of these physiological changes in the clinical setting.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: General knowledge on climate change effects and adaptation strategies has increased significantly in recent years. However, there is still a substantial information gap regarding the influence of climate change on infectious diseases and how these diseases should be identified. From a One Health perspective, zoonotic infections are of particular concern. The climate in Northern regions is changing faster than the global average. This study sought to identify climate-sensitive infectious diseases (CSIs) of relevance for humans and/or animals living in Northern regions. Inclusion criteria for CSIs were constructed using expert assessments. Based on these principles, 37 potential CSIs relevant for Northern regions were identified. A systematic literature search was performed in three databases using an explicit stepwise approach to determine whether the literature supports selection of these 37 potential CSIs. RESULTS: In total, 1275 nominated abstracts were read and categorised using predefined criteria. Results showed that arthropod vector-borne diseases in particular are recognised as having potential to expand their distribution towards Northern latitudes and that tick-borne encephalitis and borreliosis, midge-borne bluetongue and the parasitic infection fasciolosis can be classified as climate-sensitive. Many of the other potential CSIs considered are affected by extreme weather events, but could not be clearly classified as climate-sensitive. An additional literature search comparing awareness of climate influences on potential CSIs between 1997-2006 and 2007-2016 showed an increase in the number of papers mentioning effects of climate change. CONCLUSIONS: The four CSIs identified in this study could be targeted in a systematic surveillance programme in Northern regions. It is evident that climate change can affect the epidemiology and geographical range of many infectious diseases, but there were difficulties in identifying additional CSIs, most likely because other factors may be of equal or greater importance. However, climate-ecological dynamics are constantly under change, and therefore diseases may fall in or out of the climate-sensitive definition over time. There is increasing awareness in the literature of the effects of climate change on infectious diseases over time.},

Fresh processed meat products were the category most frequently implicated. In the Salmonella outbreaks, the total number of all reported cases was 2279, of whom 1891 were laboratory confirmed. The number of reported cases requiring hospitalization was 94, and seven were reported dead. Regarding Salmonella, eight serovars caused those outbreaks. The most common serovar causing Salmonella-related outbreaks was Salmonella Typhimurium. The food category most frequently implicated in those outbreaks was raw-cured fermented sausages. Other organisms linked to meat-associated outbreaks, but less frequently reported, were Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum, and Listeria monocytogenes. Issues of the burden of outbreaks, the challenges of comparing global outbreaks, food attribution, and how the meat industry works to meet consumer demands while maintaining food safety are discussed.},

	abstract = {Toxocariasis is an emerging zoonotic disease caused by Toxocara canis and T. cati. Toxocariasis and its etiological agents are of global public health importance, whose burden appears underestimated, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The diversity in the transmission routes of these parasites contributes to disease prevalence and often hinders disease control measures. This study aimed to review the epidemiological distribution of Toxocara infections in SSA region. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis). We identified 94 relevant, peer-reviewed articles, out of which, 75 articles were found eligible based on Toxocara infections in dogs, cats and humans. Overall, 27,102 samples were examined for T. canis in dogs, T. cati in cats and Toxocara serology in humans, out of which 6142 were positive for Toxocara infection: 3717 (13.7\%) in dogs (faecal, 3487; necropsy, 180; hair, 50); 266 (1\%) in cats (faecal, 101; necropsy, 165); and 2159 (8\%) in humans (serology). Overall mean prevalences of 19\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 14-23\%), 9\% (95\% CI: 0-28\%) and 36\% (95\% CI: 24-49\%) were recorded in dogs, cats and humans, respectively. Substantial heterogeneity was observed between studies and subgroups (I2 = 99\%, P {\textless} 0.01). Findings from the review showed that studies on the epidemiology of Toxocara infections in the SSA region are limited. We strongly recommend focused, collaborative and coordinated studies to determine Toxocara spp. prevalence in various hosts, including food animals and the environment, through a 'One Health' approach across SSA countries.},

	abstract = {Equine piroplasmosis (EP) is a tick-borne disease of economic importance, relevant in the international movement of equids. The causative agents are at least two apicomplexan protozoan parasites Babesia caballi and Theileria equi. To date, there is no study that estimates global and regional exposure of equids to EP. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the pooled prevalence and heterogeneity of EP using random-effects model. Six electronic databases were searched for publications on EP and assessed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 66 eligible studies published between 1990 and 2019 and representing 24 041 equids were included. The overall pooled prevalence estimates (PPEs) of B. caballi was 22.3\% (95\% CI 21.7-22.8), while the overall PPE for T. equi was 29.4\% (95\% CI 28.7-30.0). The overall pooled prevalence due to co-infection with both parasites was 11.8\% (95\% CI 11.32-12.32). Also, subgroup analysis according to sex, age, diagnostic technique, equid species, region and publication years showed a substantial degree of heterogeneity across studies computed for both B. caballi and T. equi infections in equids. Awareness of the current status of EP globally will alert the relevant authorities and stakeholders where necessary on the need for better preventive and control strategies against the disease.},

The aim of this review is to systemically search the available literature concerning the clinical performance of eggshell as a substitute material in guided bone regeneration in oral surgery. Five databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase) were searched up to February 2020. Clinical trials that used eggshell as a bone substitute material were included in the review. Animal and in vivo studies were excluded from the review. ROBINS-I was used to evaluate the risk of bias. A total of 840 studies were retrieved, out of which 55 full-text articles were screened. Five studies were finally included: one study showed critical and four serious risk of bias. A total of 74 patients and 88 intervention sites were included in the five studies. Clinical and radiological evaluation showed complete healing during the follow-ups. Statistically significant radiological and clinical evidence of new bone formation was achieved for socket preservation, grafting after third molar extraction, and cystic/apicectomy grafting. One patient with complications was reported. Histological analysis and micro computed tomography confirmed that it promotes bone regeneration. A comparison with synthetic hydroxyapatite showed similar healing characteristics. Within the limitations of the included studies, the eggshell can be safely and efficiently used in guided bone regeneration procedures, but more research is needed to completely evaluate the full potential of this material.},

	abstract = {Background: Maternal care refers to the behavior performed by the dam to nourish and protect her litter during its early development. Frequent and high-quality performance of such maternal behaviors is critical for the neurodevelopment of the pups. Maternal exposure to stress during early development can impair maternal care and amplify the deleterious effects of poor maternal caregiving and neglect. As such, a thorough understanding of the effects caused by several models of early life stress on maternal care may yield more insights into the relationship between stress and maternal behavior. Methods: A systematic review was performed to identify and address the effects of early life stress on maternal behavior. The search was conducted using three online databases: PUBMED, Embase, and Web of Science. To provide clear evidence of the impact of stress on maternal care, in every study, the stress group was always compared to a control group. Outcomes were categorized into eight different behaviors: (1) licking/grooming; (2) arched-back nursing; (3) blanket-nursing/passive nursing; (4) nest building; (5) contact with pups; (6) harmful/adverse caregiving; (7) no contact; (8) nest exits. Additionally, the methodological quality of the studies was evaluated. Results: A total of 12 different early life stress protocols were identified from the 56 studies included in this systematic review. Our data demonstrate that different stress models can promote specific maternal patterns of behavior. Regarding the maternal separation protocol, we observed an overall increase in nursing and licking/grooming behaviors, which are essential for pup development. An increase in the number of nest exits, which represents a fragmentation of maternal care, was observed in the limited bedding protocol, but the total amount of maternal care appears to remain similar between groups. Conclusions: Each stress protocol has unique characteristics that increase the difficulty of rendering comparisons of maternal behavior. The increase in maternal care observed in the maternal separation protocol may be an attempt to overcompensate for the time off-nest. Fragmented maternal care is a key component of the limited bedding protocol. Moreover, the methodological approaches to evaluate maternal behavior, such as time, duration, and behavior type should be more homogeneous across studies.},

	abstract = {Approximately one-third of the fluid milk produced in the United States is lost annually. One important factor contributing to the loss is the contamination with spore-forming bacteria, which can not only survive the pasteurization process but also grow under refrigeration conditions, resulting in subsequent spoilage. The objective of this study was to describe the population dynamics of spore-forming bacteria in milk, from the farm to the packaged product, through a systematic review approach. A database search was conducted to identify, appraise, and summarize primary research studies that described the prevalence and/or concentration of spore-forming bacteria throughout the fluid milk supply chain. Due to variations in sampling points in reported studies, the pasteurized milk supply chain was standardized to include the following steps: "milking machine", "raw milk", "bulk tank", "transportation", "silo", "pasteurized milk" and "packaged milk". A literature search retrieved 9,778 citations, from which 46 relevant citations were selected for data extraction and subsequent meta-analysis. Concentration data were more abundant with 758 data points, as compared to prevalence data with 74 data points. In general, great heterogeneity was observed among studies on the contamination in milk samples with spore-forming bacteria. The findings showed that the concentration of spore-forming bacteria in milk samples increased within the range of 0.58-2.41 logs CFU/mL from raw milk to pasteurized milk according to the weighted mean estimates. Similarly, the prevalence of contaminated samples with spore-forming bacteria increased from 23\% on farm, to up to 58\% at the step of "pasteurized milk". Meta-regression analysis indicates that the variables, season and location, of the study, accounted for 56.35\% of the between-study heterogeneity. Although considerable primary research has been conducted on this topic, there are limited studies that comprehensively describe the dynamic changes of spore-forming bacteria under the current milk production system. In summary, the analyses based on comprehensively collected evidence show that the contamination of spore-forming bacteria originating from the farm remains stable with steady increases as the milk moves downstream. These findings indicate that in addition to on-farm interventions, special attention should be paid to introducing effective mitigation measures at the processing stage to further lower spore-forming bacteria levels introduced by the raw milk, and to prevent post-pasteurization contamination from raw ingredients and processing environments.},

The chemical composition of propolis varies and depends on the geographical area, time of collection, seasonality, illumination, altitude, and food availability during propolis exploitation. The goal of this review is to discuss important concepts including mechanisms of action and therapeutic activities of propolis. The PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for the literature published from January the 1st 2000 to October the 1st 2017. Sixteen animals and three clinical studies were included. A quantitative and qualitative review was performed on the clinical trials and the animal studies were comprehensively overviewed. In this study, the clinical trials have been combined and the results were provided as meta-analysis. Propolis is a non-toxic natural product; however some cases of allergy and contact dermatitis to this compound have been described mainly among beekeepers. An important factor in impaired wound healing is biofilm formation; propolis as an anti-microbial agent can reduce biofilm generation and result in accelerated healing processes. Most of the in vivo studies on various wound models suggested the beneficial roles of propolis on experimental wound healing and this has also been approved in the clinical trial studies. However, there is a lack of information concerning, dose, side effects and clinical effectiveness of propolis on wounds. As the effectiveness of propolis between different products is variable, more characterizations should be done and future investigations comparing different propolis based products and characterization of their specific roles on different models of wounds are highly appreciated.},

We searched relevant articles published in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science before July 2016. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement was used to evaluate the quality of 93 included studies. We observed that the pooled prevalence rates of S. aureus contamination in pasteurized and boiled cow's milk, raw cow's milk, and raw Caprinae milk were 15.4\% (95\% CI, 6.1-27.5\%), 33.5\% (95\% CI, 29.5-37.7\%) and 25.8\% (95\% CI, 17.5-35.0\%), respectively. The pooled prevalence rates of MRSA contamination were 4.9\% (95\% CI, 0.0-15.7\%), 2.3\% (95\% CI, 1.3-3.6\%), and 1.1\% (95\% CI, 0.5-1.8\%), respectively. The prevalence of S. aureus contamination in raw cow's milk increased over time. However, the pooled prevalence of raw cow's milk contaminated with S. aureus was lowest in European studies. These findings give an indication of the consequence of better milk regulation in Europe. High S. aureus prevalence rates in raw milk collected from farms and processing companies pose a potential threat to consumers. The implementation of good hygiene practices, appropriate health knowledge, and food safety principles at the farm level, as well as the prudent use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine and heat treatment before drinking, are necessary to reduce the potential risk of S. aureus and MRSA contamination.},

We searched all articles on ESBL-E and CPE in these African regions published in PubMed, African Journals Online and Google Scholar from 2000 onwards. Among the 1201 articles retrieved, we selected 165 studies (West Africa, 118; Central Africa, 47) with data from 22 of the 26 West and Central Africa countries. Regarding the settings, 136 articles focused only on humans (carriage and/or infection), 6 articles on humans and animals, 13 on animals, 1 on humans and the environment, 8 on the environment and 1 on humans, animals and environments. ESBL-E prevalence ranged from 11-72\% in humans and 7-79\% in aquatic environments (wastewater). In animals, ESBL-E prevalence hugely varied: 0\% in cattle, 11-36\% in chickens, 20\% in rats, 21-71\% in pigs and 32-75\% in dogs. The bla(CTX-M-15) gene was the predominant ESBL-encoding gene and was associated with plasmids of incompatibility groups F, H, K, Y, N, I1 and R. CPE were studied only in humans. Class B metallo-β-lactamases (NDM) and class D oxacillinases (OXA-48 and OXA-181) were the most common carbapenemases. Our results show major knowledge gaps, particularly on ESBL and CPE in animals and the environment, that might limit antimicrobial resistance management in these regions.

In addition to this assessment of humoral immunity, cellular immunity could help assess effectiveness and protection through a broad range of parameters. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review all literature on the kinetics and composition of the cellular immune response to rabies vaccination in humans. A total of 1360 studies were identified in an extensive literature search. Twenty studies were selected for inclusion. In a primary response, plasma cells are detectable from day 7 to day 14, peaking at day 10. Memory B-cells appear from day 10 up to at least day 28. After revaccination, natural killer (NK) cells are the first detectable cellular parameters. Further research is required to assess cellular parameters in relation to long-term (serological) immunity.

Those selected approached the finishing of confined cows and specified animal genetic group, breed, and age at experiment start. Moreover, all these studies evaluated sensory and organoleptic characteristics of meat, following the same method. Each variable was analyzed by logistic regression, using the LOGISTIC procedure of SAS. The factors were evaluated by odds ratio (OR), in which changes in the probability of meat tenderness were estimated by means of an add-on function in regression variable units. Animal age at the beginning of termination, percentages of zebuine blood and heterozygosity, and marbling score are factors that affect (p {\textless} 0.30) the chance of beef tenderness. The probabilities of obtaining a tender meat increase when age at termination beginning and zebuine genotype participation are reduced, as well as when heterozygosity (via crosses) and meat marbling score increases.},

The aim of the current systematic review study is to clarify the latest status of studies in the literature regarding SAG1-associated recombinant proteins or SAG1-associated recombinant DNAs as potential vaccines against toxoplasmosis. Data were systematically collected from six databases including PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Google Scholar, EBSCO and Scopus, up to 1st of January 2019. A total of 87 articles were eligible for inclusion criteria in the current systematic review. The most common antigens used for experimental cocktail vaccines together with SAG1 were ROP2 and SAG2. In addition, the most parasite strains used were RH and ME49. Freund's adjuvant and cholera toxin have been predominantly utilized. Furthermore, regarding the animal models, route and dose of vaccination, challenge methods, measurement of immune responses and cyst burden have been discussed in the text. Most of these experimental vaccines induce immune responses and have a high degree of protection against parasite infections, increase survival rates and duration and reduce cyst burdens. The data demonstrated that SAG1 antigen has a high potential for use as a vaccine and provided a promising approach for protecting humans and animals against toxoplasmosis.},

The search was conducted in Medline and Science Direct to identify experimental preclinical studies involving animal models of SCI, physical exercise as an intervention and the assessment of NP. Fifteen articles met the eligibility criteria. The review shows that in studies of NP involving animal models of SCI, rodents are the most common species. Thoracic contusion is the most common injury and mechanical and thermal nociception are the most frequently assessed NP components. The benefits of physical exercise vary according to its starting period and total duration. In addition, there is considerable heterogeneity regarding the type and intensity of exercise capable of alleviating NP after SCI. Furthermore, physical exercise has beneficial effects on mechanical, thermal and cold nociception, and spontaneous pain. These results are weakened by the paucity of studies involving these pain outcomes. The review protocol is published for free access on the SyRF platform (http://syrf.org.uk/protocols/).},

In this context, arginine is a precursor in the synthesis of numerous molecules, such as nitric oxide and polyamines, which play an important role during reproduction. However, contradictory studies are found in the literature, particularly regarding the amount of supplementation and the period of pregnancy in which it is used. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of dietary arginine supplementation for pregnant sows on foetal development via a systematic review. The search for papers was performed during the month of December 2015, in the databases ISI Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, and SciELO. From a total of 5675 returned studies, only 13 papers were selected after applying selection criteria. Most (47\%) of the studies that evaluated the effects of dietary arginine supplementation on foetal development in pigs used 1\% arginine. Supplementation was initiated in the first third of pregnancy in 47\% of tests, including in both primiparous and multiparous sows. These studies showed positive results for embryo survival and foetal development, evidenced by the increase in placental weight and the number and weight of piglets born alive. Of all evaluated studies, 53\% showed benefits on foetal development. It is concluded that supplementing dietary arginine in gestating sows can benefit embryo survival and foetal development. However, to establish a supplementation plan with this amino acid, aspects related to the period of pregnancy, supplementation levels, and source of arginine must be well defined.},

The objective of this study was to verify the effectiveness of citrulline and N-carbamylglutamate (NCG) dietary supplementation as arginine precursors for mammalian species, and the effects on fetal development through a systematic review. The search for studies was performed during August 2018 in the PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Science Direct, and Scopus databases. The literature search was conducted using "arginine precursor", "citrulline", or "N-carbamylglutamate" as keywords, combined with "gestation", "pregnancy", "fetus", "newborn", or "reproduction". Studies in which arginine precursors were evaluated in gestating mammals and their effects on parameters related to the intrauterine development of the conceptus were selected. Of 1,379 articles, 18 were selected, primarily based on the title and the abstract. Supplementation with NCG (0.5 g to 2 g/kg of feed) increased maternal plasma arginine concentrations in all studies that evaluated this variable. Fetal number increased in 55.56\% of the studies that evaluated it, and fetal weight increased in the majority (62.5\%) of the studies evaluating this variable. By supplementing citrulline, only fetal weight was improved, with an increase in maternal plasma arginine in 40\% of the studies. In conclusion, N-carbamoyl glutamate seems to be an arginine precursor more effective than L-citrulline during gestation; however, both precursors, beside L-Arginine, should be evaluated in similar conditions to confirm the existence of specific particularities such as periods and levels of supplementation, which need to be considered for different species of animals. The supplementation of NCG increases arginine concentrations in maternal plasma, thus improving mammalian reproductive efficiency and fetal development, mainly by promoting higher birth weight.},

	abstract = {Host immune responses are pivotal for the successful treatment of the leishmaniases, a spectrum of infections caused by Leishmania parasites. Previous studies speculated that augmenting cytokines associated with a type 1 T-helper cell (Th1) response is necessary to combat severe forms of leishmaniasis, and it has been hypothesized that the antileishmanial drug miltefosine is capable of immunomodulation and induction of Th1 cytokines. A better understanding of the immunomodulatory effects of miltefosine is central to providing a rationale regarding synergistic mechanisms of activity to combine miltefosine optimally with other conventional and future antileishmanials that are currently under development. Therefore, a systematic literature search was performed to evaluate to what extent and how miltefosine influences the host Th1 response. Miltefosine's effects observed in both a preclinical and a clinical context associated with immunomodulation in the treatment of leishmaniasis are evaluated in this review. A total of 27 studies were included in the analysis. Based on the current evidence, miltefosine is not only capable of inducing direct parasite killing but also of modulating the host immunity. Our findings suggest that miltefosine-induced activation of Th1 cytokines, particularly represented by increased gamma interferon (IFN-P) and interleukin 12 (IL-12), is essential to prevail over the Leishmania-driven Th2 response. Differences in miltefosine-induced host-mediated effects between in vitro, ex vivo, animal model, and human studies are further discussed. All things considered, an effective treatment with miltefosine is acquired by enhanced functional Th1 cytokine responses and may further be enhanced in combination with immunostimulatory agents.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The soil-transmitted helminths (STH), Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworms, infect 1.5 billion people worldwide and cause an estimated burden of 3.3 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Current control strategies focus on morbidity reduction through preventive chemotherapy (PC) but the most commonly used recommended drugs (albendazole and mebendazole) are particularly inefficacious against T. trichiura. This, together with the threat of emerging drug resistance, calls for new control strategies, including co-administration with other anthelminthics. Ivermectin plus albendazole is widely used against lymphatic filariasis, but its efficacy and safety against STH infections has not yet been fully understood. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of ivermectin-albendazole co-administration in five different databases (i.e. PubMed, ISI Web of Science, ScienceDirect, CENTRAL and clinicaltrials.gov) from 1960 to January 2018. Four studies reporting efficacy of ivermectin-albendazole against STH infections and five studies on its safety met the selection criteria and were included for quantitative analysis. Ivermectin-albendazole was significantly associated with lower risk (risk ratio (RR) = 0.44, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.31-0.62) for T. trichiura infection after treatment compared to albendazole alone. The co-administration revealed no or only a marginal benefit on cure and egg reduction rates over albendazole alone for A. lumbricoides and hookworm infections. Adverse events (AEs) occurring after ivermectin-albendazole co-administration were mostly mild and transient. Overall, the number of individuals reporting any AE was not different (RR = 1.09, 95\% CI = 0.87-1.36) in co-treated and albendazole-treated patients. However, although not statistically significant, sub-group analysis showed a tendency for slightly more AEs in patients with filariasis treated with ivermectin-albendazole compared to those treated with albendazole alone (RR = 1.29, 95\% CI = 0.81-2.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a good tolerability and higher efficacy of ivermectin-albendazole against T. trichiura compared to the current standard single-dose albendazole treatment, which supports the use of this co-administration in PC programs. Large-scale definitive randomized controlled trials are required to confirm our results.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Patients with myocardial infarction and hypoxemia require supplemental oxygen. However, the current therapeutic paradigm is contradicted by several recent studies in which the post-infarcted heart appears to benefit from systemic hypoxia. With this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to discover whether systemic hypoxia is beneficial or detrimental to the infarcted myocardium. METHODS: We conducted an electronic search of the PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases and extracted the outcomes of cardiac function, geometry, and hemodynamics. A random-effect model was applied when the I2 value of greater than 50\%. The sensitivity analysis was performed by omitting one study at a time, and publication bias was assessed using Egger's test. In addition, the quality of studies was evaluated using the risk of bias tool devised by the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation. RESULTS: Six reports comprising 14 experiments were ultimately screened from among 10,323 initially identified preclinical studies. Few studies reported the method of randomization and none described allocation concealment, random outcome assessment or blinding. Overall, chronic hypoxia was found to have a beneficial effect on the ejection fraction (standard mean difference [SMD] = 5.39; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 3.83 to 6.95; P {\textless} 0.001) of the infarcted heart, whereas acute hypoxia significantly improved hemodynamics, as indicated by an increase in the maximal rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (SMD = 1.27; 95\% CI, 0.27 to 2.28; P = 0.013) and cardiac output (SMD = 1.26; 95\% CI, 0.34 to 2.18; P = 0.007) and a decrease in total systematic vascular resistance (SMD = -0.89; 95\% CI, -1.24 to -0.53; P {\textless} 0.001). Furthermore, a reduced oxygen content increased the stroke volume (P = 0.010). However, hypoxia reduced the end-systolic (SMD = -2.67; 95\% CI, -4.09 to -1.26; P {\textless} 0.001) and end-diastolic (SMD = -3.61; 95\% CI, -4.65 to -2.57; P {\textless} 0.001) left ventricular diameters and increased the total pulmonary resistance (SMD = 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.20 to 1.33; P = 0.008), pulmonary arterial mean pressure (SMD = 2.02; 95\% CI, 0.23 to 3.81; P = 0.027), and left atrial pressure (SMD = 1.20; 95\% CI, 0.57 to 1.82; P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: Hypoxia significantly improved heart function after infarction, with particular beneficial effects on systolic function and hemodynamics. However, it had slightly adverse effects on pulmonary circulation and left ventricular geometry. A lower inspired oxygen concentration may improve cardiac function, although further research is needed to determine the optimum level of hypoxia. Finally, more studies of hypoxia and myocardial infarction in larger species are required before these findings can be incorporated into therapeutic guidelines.},

All types of peer-reviewed analytical studies, observational or experimental and published in English, could be included in the review, regardless of publication year. Of 152 identified records, 18 articles were selected, of which 8 were prospective cohort studies, 9 were cross-sectional, and 1 was a hybrid case-control study. Internal validity of studies was assessed using a score system ranging from 0 to 6, based on design, risk of bias, and statistical methods. The most frequent study limitation was improper use of statistical methods to avoid confounding of associations between THK and CM or SCM. The 3 studies that used CM as outcome (all with high validity scores) showed positive associations with THK (especially severe), although the magnitude and statistical significance of the estimates differed among them. Most studies that used SCM as the primary outcome (based on microbiological examination of milk) reported that only severe THK was associated with SCM. Two studies with high validity scores reported moderate to strong associations between severe THK and incidence or prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus intramammary infection. Two studies with high validity scores reported that only severe THK was associated with the risk of somatic cell count (SCC) ≥200,000 cells/mL and increased mean SCC, respectively. Although 4 cross-sectional studies reported positive associations between THK and SCC, these associations were possibly spurious because confounding factors, such as parity, were not considered in the analyses. Results of the reviewed studies suggest that severe THK is a risk factor for both CM and SCM, as defined by microbiological examination of milk, SCC thresholds, or mean SCC. The effect of severe THK on both contagious (especially Staphylococcus aureus) and environmental CM or SCM emphasizes the importance of teat health for mastitis control. Four studies demonstrated that quarters with mild THK had lower prevalence of intramammary infection or lower mean SCC than quarters with no THK, suggesting that development of mild THK, as a physiological response to milking, can have a protective effect. Dairy consultants should focus on monitoring and minimizing occurrence of severe THK to prevent CM and SCM.},

FINDINGS: Culture influences attitudes and preferences towards robots, but due to the limitations of the reviewed studies, concrete conclusions cannot be made. More consistent evidence was found with regard to the influence of culture on nonverbal behaviors and communication styles, with people being more accepting of a robot that behaved more closely to their own culture. CONCLUSIONS: The research field of human-robot interaction provides the current evidence on the influence that culture has on attitudes towards humanoid and animal-like robots, but more research that is guided by strong theoretical frameworks is needed. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: With the increased use of humanoid robots in the healthcare system, it is imperative that nurses and other healthcare professionals explore and understand the different factors that can affect the use of robots with patients.},

METHODS: Using the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines we searched MEDLINE, PUBMED, CINHAL, EMBASE, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore digital library. Nineteen (19) articles met the criteria for inclusion. RESULTS: Health care workers reported mixed views regarding the use of robots. They considered an array of tasks that robots could perform; they addressed the issue of patient safety and raised concerns about privacy. CONCLUSIONS: A limited number of studies have explored the views of health care workers about the use of robots. Considering the fast pace with which technology is advancing in the care field, it is critical to conduct more research in this area. Impact Statement: Robots will increasingly have a role to play in nursing, health and social care. The potential impact will be challenging for the healthcare workforce. It is therefore important for nurses and other health and social care workers to engage in discussion regarding the contribution of robots and their impact not only on nursing care but also on future roles of health and social care workers.},

METHODS: We searched four representing databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database, and the Web of Science up to December 2016. Randomized animal studies were included if the effects of any herbal medicine were tested on cancer cachexia. The methodological quality was evaluated by the Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies (CAMARADE) checklist. RESULTS: A total of fourteen herbal medicines and their compounds were identified, including Coptidis Rhizoma, berberine, Bing De Ling, curcumin, Qing-Shu-Yi-Qi-Tang, Scutellaria baicalensis, Hochuekkito, Rikkunshito, hesperidin, atractylodin, Sipjeondaebo-tang, Sosiho-tang, Anemarrhena Rhizoma, and Phellodendri Cortex. All the herbal medicines, except curcumin, have been shown to ameliorate the symptoms of cancer cachexia through anti-inflammation, regulation of the neuroendocrine pathway, and modulation of the ubiquitin proteasome system or protein synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that herbal medicines might be a useful approach for treating cancer cachexia.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine the antiobesity effects of Panax ginseng in animals. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search for all controlled trials (up to March 2017) that assessed the antiobesity effects of P. ginseng in animal obesity models in the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. The primary outcome was final body weight measured at the longest follow-up time after administration of the intervention. The secondary outcome was the lipid profile. We assessed methodological quality using the SYRCLE risk of bias tool, and RevMan 5.3 was used to perform a meta-analysis. Finally, a subgroup analysis of parameters including intervention duration, animal models, and type of ginseng was performed. RESULT: We identified 16 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Data from the meta-analysis indicated that the intervention group had a significantly lower body weight than the control group (SMD: -1.50, 95\% CI: -1.90 to -1.11, χ(2): 78.14, P {\textless} 0.0001, I(2) = 58\%). Final body weight was lower in an animal obesity model induced by high-fat diet than in genetic models. Also the intervention group had a significantly higher serum HDL level and lower serum LDL, TG, and TC level than the control group. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis indicated that oral administration of P. ginseng significantly inhibits weight gain and improves serum lipid profiles in animal obesity models. However, causes of obesity and type of ginseng may affect treatment effects.},

	abstract = {Peripheral nerve injury is a common posttraumatic complication. The precise surgical repair of nerve lesion does not always guarantee satisfactory motor and sensory function recovery. Therefore, enhancement of the regeneration process is a subject of many research strategies. It is believed that polyethylene glycol (PEG) mediates axolemmal fusion, thus enabling the direct restoration of axon continuity. It also inhibits Wallerian degeneration and recovers nerve conduction. This systemic review, performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, describes and summarizes published studies on PEG treatment efficiency in various nerve injury types and repair techniques. Sixteen original experimental studies in animal models and one in humans were analyzed. PEG treatment superiority was reported in almost all experiments (based on favorable electrophysiological, histological, or behavioral results). To date, only one study attempted to transfer the procedure into the clinical phase. However, some technical aspects, e.g., the maximal delay between trauma and successful treatment, await determination. PEG therapy is a promising prospect that may improve the surgical treatment of peripheral nerve injuries in the clinical practice.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Low-intensity transcranial focused ultrasound stimulation (TFUS) holds great promise as a highly focal technique for transcranial stimulation even for deep brain areas. Yet, knowledge about the safety of this novel technique is still limited. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review safety related aspects of TFUS. The review covers the mechanisms-of-action by which TFUS may cause adverse effects and the available data on the possible occurrence of such effects in animal and human studies. METHODS: Initial screening used key term searches in PubMed and bioRxiv, and a review of the literature lists of relevant papers. We included only studies where safety assessment was performed, and this results in 33 studies, both in humans and animals. RESULTS: Adverse effects of TFUS were very rare. At high stimulation intensity and/or rate, TFUS may cause haemorrhage, cell death or damage, and unintentional blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening. TFUS may also unintentionally affect long-term neural activity and behaviour. A variety of methods was used mainly in rodents to evaluate these adverse effects, including tissue staining, magnetic resonance imaging, temperature measurements and monitoring of neural activity and behaviour. In 30 studies, adverse effects were absent, even though at least one Food and Drug Administration (FDA) safety index was frequently exceeded. Two studies reported microhaemorrhages after long or relatively intense stimulation above safety limits. Another study reported BBB opening and neuronal damage in a control condition, which intentionally and substantially exceeded the safety limits. CONCLUSION: Most studies point towards a favourable safety profile of TFUS. Further investigations are warranted to establish a solid safety framework for the therapeutic window of TFUS to reliably avoid adverse effects while ensuring neural effectiveness. The comparability across studies should be improved by a more standardized reporting of TFUS parameters.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: With cannabis consumption on the rise and use prominent among males of reproductive age it is essential to understand the potential impact of cannabis on male fertility. We reviewed the literature regarding the effects of cannabis on male fertility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a literature search using PubMed®/MEDLINE® to identify relevant studies of the effects of cannabis on male fertility. Relevant studies were identified and reviewed. RESULTS: The strongest evidence of cannabis induced alterations in male fertility is in the category of semen parameters. Research supports a role for cannabis in reducing sperm count and concentration, inducing abnormalities in sperm morphology, reducing sperm motility and viability, and inhibiting capacitation and fertilizing capacity. Animal models demonstrate a role for cannabis in testicular atrophy, and reduced libido and sexual function but to our knowledge these results have not yet been replicated in human studies. Studies of hormonal changes suggest inconclusive effects on testosterone levels, lowered luteinizing hormone levels and unchanged follicle-stimulating hormone levels. CONCLUSIONS: Current research suggests that cannabis may negatively impact male fertility. Further studies are needed to validate that robust findings in animal models will carry over into human experience. Clinicians should be aware of these potential effects when prescribing medical marijuana therapies to men of reproductive age, and they should consider the degree of cannabis use as a possible component of a complete male infertility workup.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Geophagy, the intentional consumption of earth, is widely practiced among humans and other mammals, but its causes are not well understood. Given the growing number of reports of geophagy among nonhuman primates (NHP), we sought to (1) advance and codify our understanding of the patterns and functional and evolutionary significance of geophagy among NHP and (2) provide a research agenda for a more unified approach to its study. METHODS: We systematically reviewed all available literature on NHP geophagy, extracted available data on taxa, geography, climate, diet, sex, age-class, reproductive status, and the characteristics of the earth. We used these data to evaluate three major hypotheses about geophagy, that it is protective, provides mineral supplementation, and is nonadaptive. RESULTS: We identified 287 accounts of geophagy among 136 species, adding 79 new primate species to the list of those considered in prior reviews. Nineteen percent of species were in the suborder Strepsirrhini, while 81\% were in the suborder Haplorrhini. There were reports of geophagy from 9 of the 17 families and 39 of the 76 genera currently recognized by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. DISCUSSION: The limited evidence suggests that geophagy is adaptive, and provides protection and mineral supplementation. We specify the behavioral, dietary, and soil data required to more rigorously investigate these hypotheses across representative species of all taxonomic groups, geographical regions, and dietary classification. Given the plausibility of geophagy for maintaining the health of both wild and captive populations, we urge further study and conservation of geophagy sites.},

	abstract = {For the past two decades, biomimetic high-density lipoproteins (b-HDL) have been used for various drug delivery applications. The b-HDL mimic the endogenous HDL, and therefore possess many attractive features for drug delivery, including high biocompatibility, biodegradability, and ability to transport and deliver their cargo (e.g. drugs and/or imaging agents) to specific cells and tissues that are recognized by HDL. The b-HDL designs reported in the literature often differ in size, shape, composition, and type of incorporated cargo. However, there exists only limited insight into how the b-HDL design dictates their biodistribution. To fill this gap, we conducted a comprehensive systematic literature search of biodistribution studies using various designs of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I)-based b-HDL (i.e. b-HDL with apoA-I, apoA-I mutants, or apoA-I mimicking peptides). We carefully screened 679 papers (search hits) for b-HDL biodistribution studies in mice, and ended up with 24 relevant biodistribution profiles that we compared according to b-HDL design. We show similarities between b-HDL biodistribution studies irrespectively of the b-HDL design, whereas the biodistribution of the b-HDL components (lipids and scaffold) differ significantly. The b-HDL lipids primarily accumulate in liver, while the b-HDL scaffold primarily accumulates in the kidney. Furthermore, both b-HDL lipids and scaffold accumulate well in the tumor tissue in tumor-bearing mice. Finally, we present essential considerations and strategies for b-HDL labeling, and discuss how the b-HDL biodistribution can be tuned through particle design and administration route. Our meta-analysis and discussions provide a detailed overview of the fate of b-HDL in mice that is highly relevant when applying b-HDL for drug delivery or in vivo imaging applications.},

	abstract = {Leg problems are highly prevalent in modern broiler production and provision of environmental enrichment could be a strategy to improve leg health. Different types of environmental enrichment have undergone evaluation. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of the effect of environmental enrichment on leg health in broiler chickens. The evaluation of leg health included measures of the entire leg and foot, and behavioural, pathological and physical measures. Six types of environmental enrichment were selected for inclusion: light programme, intensity of light, stocking density, perches, straw bales and separation of resources. For each type, a systematic literature search was performed. The review included 62 studies; 56 randomised trials and six cross-sectional studies. An assessment of the methodological quality of all 56 randomised trials was performed with some reporting deficits regarding occurrence of blinding, randomisation and reliability of measures. Provision of perches and increased intensity of light only displayed limited effectiveness in improving leg health and both mainly affected contact dermatitis. In contrast, there was evidence that a lowered stocking density and a dark/light schedule could improve leg health. Few studies have been carried out on the effect of straw bales and separation of resources. The few studies done have, however, shown that both types of enrichment can be effective in improving leg health. In conclusion, identifying and providing the optimal types of enrichment for broilers will reduce leg problems and increase mobility, thereby improving the welfare of the birds.},

	abstract = {Brucellosis is a neglected zoonotic disease of remarkable importance worldwide. The focus of this systematic review was to investigate occupational brucellosis and to identify the main infection risks for each group exposed to the pathogen. Seven databases were used to identify papers related to occupational brucellosis: CABI, Cochrane, Pubmed, Scielo, Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science. The search resulted in 6123 studies, of which 63 were selected using the quality assessment tools guided from National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Case Report Guidelines (CARE). Five different job-related groups were considered greatly exposed to the disease: rural workers, abattoir workers, veterinarians and veterinary assistants, laboratory workers and hunters. The main risk factors and exposure sources involved in the occupational infection observed from the analysis of the articles were direct contact with animal fluids, failure to comply with the use of personal protective equipment, accidental exposure to live attenuated anti-brucellosis vaccines and non-compliance with biosafety standards. Brucella species frequently isolated from job-related infection were Brucella melitensis, Brucella abortus, Brucella suis and Brucella canis. In addition, a meta-analysis was performed using the case-control studies and demonstrated that animal breeders, laboratory workers and abattoir workers have 3.47 [95\% confidence interval (CI); 1.47-8.19] times more chance to become infected with Brucella spp. than others individuals that have no contact with the possible sources of infection. This systematic review improved the understanding of the epidemiology of brucellosis as an occupational disease. Rural workers, abattoir workers, veterinarians, laboratory workers and hunters were the groups more exposed to occupational Brucella spp. infection. Moreover, it was observed that the lack of knowledge about brucellosis among frequently exposed professionals, in addition to some behaviors, such as negligence in the use of individual and collective protective measures, increases the probability of infection.},

	abstract = {Dermatophytoses are inflammatory cutaneous mycoses caused by dermatophyte fungi of the genera Trichophyton, Microsporum, and Epidermophyton that affect both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. With therapeutic failure, dermatophytoses can become chronic and recurrent. This is partly due to their ability to develop biofilms, microbial communities involved in a polymeric matrix attached to biotic or abiotic surfaces, contributing to fungal resistance. This review presents evidence accumulated in recent years on antidermatophyte biofilm activity. The following databases were used: Web of Science, Medline/PubMed (via the National Library of Medicine), Embase, and Scopus. Original articles published between 2011 and 2020, emphasizing the antifungal activity of conventional and new drugs against dermatophyte biofilms were eligible. A total of 11 articles met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed - the studies used in vitro and ex vivo (fragments of nails and hair) experimental models. The articles focused on reports of antibiofilm activity for conventional antifungals, natural drugs, and new therapeutic tools. The strains reported on were T. mentagrophytes, T. rubrum, T. tonsurans, M. canis, and M. gypseum. Between the studies, the wide variability of experimental conditions in vitro and ex vivo was observed. The data suggest the need for methodological standardization (at some minimum). This review systematically presents current studies involving agents that present antibiofilm activity against dermatophytes; and an overview of the ideal in vitro and ex vivo experimental conditions to guarantee biofilm formation that may assist future research. LAY ABSTRACT: This review presents the current studies on the antibiofilm activities of drugs against dermatophytes and ideal experimental conditions, which might guarantee in vitro and ex vivo biofilm formation. It can be useful to examine the efficacy of new antimicrobial drugs against dermatophytes.},

Equine-assisted activities and therapies (EAATs) have been used as alternative non-pharmacological intervention option in patients with ADHD. WHAT DOES THIS PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Nowadays, more studies of high methodological quality are needed to determine whether EAAT is an effective intervention for the treatment in children with ADHD. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Between 15 and 40 min of rising horses, 8-32 total sessions, for 4-32 weeks, seem to be beneficial to reduce the symptoms of ADHD. ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a disorder characterized by problems of inattention and impulsive hyperactivity. Equine-assisted activities and therapies (EAATs) have become an emerging non-pharmacological intervention option in patients with ADHD. AIM: To perform a systematic review of updated literature about EAAT in children with ADHD. METHOD: A systematic review was performed until 28 November 2019, in four electronic databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Google Scholar. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) intervention programme, with pre- and post-data, based on EAAT, (b) children with ADHD and (c) articles written in English. RESULTS: A total of 9 articles were found that meet the inclusion criteria. The evidence level was C for 7 studies and B for 2 studies. The level of conclusion was 3. DISCUSSION: There are few studies with high methodological quality, and there is a high heterogeneity in the variables included, what make that the level of evidence and conclusion are low. CONCLUSION: There is no account with enough studies of high methodological quality to determine whether EAAT is an effective intervention for the treatment in children with ADHD.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.phymed.2017.09.024},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Millions of people in the world suffer from chronic wounds of different etiologies such as diabetic foot and leg ulcers, without solutions nowadays. Molecules obtained from plants offer an alternative to aid wound healing. Strong evidence about essential oils (EO) anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties is thoroughly described in literature and their chemical compositions are well characterized. More recently, EO effects in experimental wounds have begun to be analyzed. AIM: We aim to summarize the evidence of EO in experimental wounds, and the possibility of combining them with biopolymers commonly used in skin regeneration. METHODS: Electronic databases such as ScienceDirect, PubMed and Scopus were used to search scientific contributions until March 2017, using relevant keywords. In a first step, literature focusing on EO and/or mono- or sesqui-terpenoids effects in rodent wounds was identified and summarized. In all cases, chemical structures and EO composition were detailed, as well as references to in vitro activities previously determined, e.g. antibacterial, antioxidant or anti-inflammatory. In a second step, scientific literature devoted to combine EO and biopolymers with the focus set on wound healing innovations, was collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Treatments with EO from species of genders Lavandula, Croton, Blumea, Eucalyptus, Pinus, Cymbopogon, Eucalyptus, Cedrus, Abies, Rosmarinus, Origanum, Salvia and Plectranthus, have shown positive results in rodent wounds. All of these EO were mainly composed by monoterpenoids-thymol, 1,8-cineole, linalool-or monoterpenes, as limonene or pinenes. Experimental wounds in rodents have shown faster closure rate, better collagen deposition and/or enhanced fibroblasts proliferation. In blends with biopolymers, several EO combined with chitosan, alginate, gelatin or collagen, were processed to give active films or nanofibers, with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory or antimicrobial activities. Curiously, all of these works were carried out since 2010. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant evidence about the effectivity of EO as wound healers. The incorporation of EO into a polymer matrix that contributes to wound healing is still incipient. However, scientific based evidence of the EO incorporation in resorbable polymeric scaffolds was found and analyzed herein. In summary, EO-biopolymer dressings or scaffolds have become promising artifacts regarding wound treatments, especially in chronic wounds, where treating infection and inflammation are still important issues.},

About 66 studies involving 1861 animals that examined the effect of M. charantia L. on type 2 diabetes mellitus were included. Fruits and seed extracts reduced fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin A1c in comparison to vehicle control: (42 studies, 815 animals; SMD, -6.86 [95\% CI; -7.95, -5.77], 3 studies, 59 animals; SMD; -7.76 [95\% CI; -12.50, -3.01]) respectively. Also, the extracts have hepato-renal protective effects at varying doses and duration of administration.

	abstract = {Immunosenescence, the decline in immune defense with age, is an important mortality source in elderly humans but little is known of immunosenescence in wild animals. We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed evidence for age-related changes in immunity in captive and free-living populations of wild species (321 effect sizes in 62 studies across 44 species of mammals, birds and reptiles). As in humans, senescence was more evident in adaptive (acquired) than innate immune functions. Declines were evident for cell function (antibody response), the relative abundance of naïve immune cells and an in vivo measure of overall immune responsiveness (local response to phytohaemagglutinin injection). Inflammatory markers increased with age, similar to chronic inflammation associated with human immunosenescence. Comparisons across taxa and captive vs free-living animals were difficult due to lack of overlap in parameters and species measured. Most studies are cross-sectional, which yields biased estimates of age-effects when immune function co-varies with survival. We therefore suggest longitudinal sampling approaches, and highlight techniques from human cohort studies that can be incorporated into ecological research. We also identify avenues to address predictions from evolutionary theory and the contribution of immunosenescence to age-related increases in disease susceptibility and mortality.},

In North Africa, cats have a particularly long record and occupy a specialized niche within many communities. This systematic review was conducted to analyze the current and historical literature documenting the breadth and variety of zoonoses in North Africa, specifically relating to the domesticated feline. Multiple electronic databases were searched on January 16, 2019, for published reports on feline zoonoses in North Africa. A total of 76 studies met the inclusion criteria for a full assessment. Articles selected for the review ranged in publication dates from 1939 to 2019 and included a case study, cross-sectional surveys, genomic analyses, and a book chapter. The most commonly studied pathogen was Toxoplasma gondii (n = 17) followed by a variety of helminths (n = 10). Of the countries in the target region, most publications were of studies conducted in Egypt (n = 53) followed by Tunisia (n = 12), Algeria (n = 11), Morocco (n = 5), and Libya (n = 3). The results of this review identify a variety of viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic zoonotic diseases associated with cats in North Africa, ranging from historically endemic diseases in both human and animal populations in the region, to emerging infections with recent confirmatory diagnoses. This review describes reported feline zoonoses in North Africa and provides recommendations for their prevention and control. In addition to vaccination campaigns for domesticated felines and postexposure prophylaxis for humans, prompt veterinary and medical care of exposure risks and subsequent infections are essential in limiting the zoonotic disease burden in North African communities of humans and cats.},

	volume = {15},
	issn = {1932-6203},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0237872},
	abstract = {Recent results have established that masticatory function plays a role not only in the balance of the stomatognathic system and in the central motor control, but also in the trophism of the hippocampus and in the cognitive activity. These implications have been shown in clinical studies and in animal researches as well, by means of histological, biochemical and behavioural techniques. This systematic review describes the effects of three forms of experimentally altered mastication, namely soft-diet feeding, molar extraction and bite-raising, on the trophism and function of the hippocampus in animal models. Through a systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, OpenGray and GrayMatters, 645 articles were identified, 33 full text articles were assessed for eligibility and 28 articles were included in the review process. The comprehensiveness of reporting was evaluated with the ARRIVE guidelines and the risk of bias with the SYRCLE RoB tool. The literature reviewed agrees that a disturbed mastication is significantly associated with a reduced number of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in Cornu Ammonis (CA)1 and CA3, downregulation of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), reduced synaptic activity, reduced neurogenesis in the Dentate Gyrus (DG), glial proliferation, and reduced performances in behavioural tests, indicating memory impairment and reduced spatial orientation. Moreover, while the bite-raised condition, characterized by occlusal instability, is known to be a source of stress, soft-diet feeding and molar extractions were not consistently associated with a stress response. More research is needed to clarify this topic. The emerging role of chewing in the preservation of hippocampal trophism, neurogenesis and synaptic activity is worthy of interest and may contribute to the study of neurodegenerative diseases in new and potentially relevant ways.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize the results of studies that have determined the effect of injectable and inhalant drugs used in anesthesia on intraocular pressure (IOP) in dogs. DATABASES USED: A comprehensive search of research literature was performed without language restriction. The search utilized the PubMed, CAB Abstracts and the University of Georgia's Galileo electronic databases using a combination of free text terms 'Ophthalmology', 'Intraocular Pressure', 'Anesthetic', 'Anesthesia', 'Canine' or 'Dog'. The time frame searched was from 1970 to October 2018. Any published research paper that dealt with sedatives or anesthetics administered systemically and the canine eye was evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of many anesthetic drugs in dogs with ocular pathology are largely unknown. Many anesthetic drugs do not induce clinically relevant changes in IOP in dogs with normal eyes, although some studies demonstrated results with statistically significant changes. The dose, route of administration, experimental conditions, drug combinations, timing of measurements, measurement technology and setting or individual animal characteristics may all produce some heterogeneity in results from multiple studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Child stunting is a major public health problem, afflicting 155 million people worldwide. Lack of animal-source protein has been identified as a risk, but effects of animal protein supplementation are not well established. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate effects of animal protein supplementation in mothers, preterm infants, and term infants/children on birth and growth outcomes. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Web of Science, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature were searched for randomized controlled trials of animal protein supplementation in mothers or infants and children (≤age 5 y), evaluating measures of anthropometry (≤age 18 y). Main outcomes included birth weight, low birth weight, small for gestational age at birth; height, height-for-age, weight, weight-for-age, weight-for-length, stunting, and wasting ≤18 y of age. Data were extracted independently in duplicate, and findings pooled using inverse variance meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was explored using I2, stratified analysis, and meta-regression, and publication bias by funnel plots, Egger's test, and fill/trim methods. RESULTS: Of 6808 unique abstracts and 357 full-text articles, 62 trials were included. The 62 trials comprised over 30,000 participants across 5 continents, including formula-based supplementation in infants and food-based supplementation in pregnancy and childhood. Maternal supplementation increased birth weight by 0.06 kg, and both formula and food-based supplementation in term infants/young children increased weight by ≤0.14 kg. Neither formula nor food-based supplementation for term infants/young children increased height, whereas the height-for-age z-score was increased in the food-based (+0.06 z-score) but not formula-based (-0.11 z-score) trials reporting this outcome. In term infants, the weight-for-length z-score was increased in trials of formula (+0.24 z-score) and food supplementation (+0.06 z-score), whereas food supplementation was also associated with reduced odds of stunting (-13\%). CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of protein from animal-source foods generally increased weight and weight-for-length in children, but with more limited effects on other growth outcomes such as attained height.},

Our study suggests a possible change in the epidemiology of reported toxoplasmosis outbreaks.

Among all the protocols evaluated, 35.60\% (110/309) were effective in inactivating oocysts. Physical methods were more effective than other methods (p {\textless}0.05). Sporulated oocysts and the T. gondii VEG strain were more resistant (p {\textless}0.05) to treatments. Although it is effective against viruses and bacteria, the use of disinfectants in water has little or no effect on T. gondii oocysts. The use of radiation and pressure were effective in inactivating oocysts, as these treatments do not include changes in temperature, they can be used in foods for raw consumption, such as vegetables, as it will not cause substantially changes in their physical and chemical characteristics. Therefore, these methods can be viable alternatives for the control of T. gondii.},

	abstract = {Understanding the structure of the respiratory microbiome and its complex interactions with opportunistic pathogenic bacteria has become a topic of great scientific and economic interest in livestock production, given the severe consequences of respiratory disease on animal health and welfare. The present review focuses on the microbial structures of the porcine upper and lower airways, and the factors that influence microbiome development and onset of respiratory disease. Following a literature search on PubMed and Scopus, 21 articles were selected based on defined exclusion criteria (20 studies performed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and one by shotgun metagenomics). Analysis of the selected literature indicated that the microbial structure of the upper respiratory tract undergoes a remarkable evolution after birth and tends to stabilise around weaning. Antimicrobial treatment, gaseous ammonia concentration, diet and floor type are amongst the recognized environmental factors influencing microbiome structure. The predominant phyla of the upper respiratory tract are Proteobacteria and Firmicutes with significant differences at the genus level between the nasal and the oropharyngeal cavity. Only five studies investigated the lower respiratory tract and their results diverged in relation to the relative abundance of these two phyla and even more in the composition of the lung microbiome at the genus level, likely because of methodological differences. Reduced diversity and imbalanced microbial composition are associated with an increased risk of respiratory disease. However, most studies presented methodological pitfalls concerning specimen collection, sequencing target and depth, and lack of quality control. Standardization of sampling and sequencing procedures would contribute to a better understanding of the structure of the microbiota inhabiting the lower respiratory tract and its relationship with pig health and disease.},

	abstract = {Recurrent infections with herpes simplex virus (HSV) in the orofacial (cold sores), ocular or genital region are common and sometimes disabling, calling for an effective preventive intervention. The bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine has beneficial off-target effects that might impact recurrence of HSV infections. In this systematic review, Medline, EMBASE, and PubMed were searched in June 2020; 16 articles were deemed relevant comprising eight animal and eight human studies (301 patients). In animals, BCG administration led to a 1.9 to 5.5-fold increase in survival rate following HSV challenge (vaginal, corneal, or intraperitoneal inoculation). This beneficial effect was influenced by the dose of BCG (higher better), mode of administration (intradermal better than intraperitoneal), and the interval between vaccination and viral challenge (at least 6 days required). In nonrandomized human studies (that failed to control for a placebo effect), BCG vaccination appeared beneficial in 78\% of adults with recurrent herpes genitalis or labialis, with 37\% being recurrence-free for an extended period, 41\% experiencing less frequent or severe episodes, and only 22\% reporting no change. This clinical benefit is consistent with the findings of immunological sub-studies. In the two studies restricted to recurrent herpes labialis, 94\% appeared to benefit from BCG. The one randomized controlled trial used an intervention in the control group that has immunomodulatory effects thus limiting interpretation. In conclusion, BCG vaccine is a potential, safe, affordable and readily available candidate intervention to decrease the high burden of disease associated with HSV infection and recurrences, but properly controlled randomized trials are required.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: The cardioprotective effects of the flavonoid hesperidin, which is present in citrus products, are controversial and unclear. This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 2015 guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the current evidence from animal and human clinical studies and thus determine whether the consumption of hesperidin exerts beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors. DATA SOURCES: PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and Study Design) criteria defined the research question. Searches of the PubMed and Cochrane Plus databases were conducted and studies that met the inclusion criteria and were published in English in the last 15 years were included. DATA EXTRACTION: The first author, year of publication, study design, characteristics of animals and humans, intervention groups, dose of hesperidin, route of administration, duration of the intervention, cardiovascular risk biomarkers assessed, and results observed were extracted from the included articles. RESULTS: A total of 12 animal studies and 11 randomized clinical trials met the inclusion criteria. In the animal studies, the glucose, total and LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels decreased with chronic flavonoid consumption. In the human studies, endothelial function improved with flavonoid consumption, whereas no conclusive results were observed for the other biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Animal studies have revealed that hesperidin and hesperetin consumption reduces glucose levels and various lipid profile parameters. However, a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn from the existing human clinical trials. Further research is needed to confirm whether the findings observed in animal models can also be observed in humans. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: Prospero registration number CRD42018088942.},

	abstract = {Background: Diseases of the pharynx and upper esophageal sphincter can result in debilitating respiratory difficulty, dysphagia or a combination of both. An exact diagnosis is essential to properly prognosticate and guide therapy. Videofluoroscopic assessment of the pharynx and upper esophageal sphincter with or without orally administered contrast material is the diagnostic of choice for many diseases as both anatomic and functional information is gleaned. The purpose of this review is to assess for continuity in imaging protocols across institutions and to record quantitative and qualitative parameters used for analysis of videofluoroscopy of the pharynx and upper esophageal sphincter in dogs. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed including articles published in peer-reviewed veterinary journals involving the topic of videofluoroscopy of the pharynx and upper esophageal sphincter through August 1, 2018. Specifics of study acquisition technique were recorded. Quantitative and qualitative videofluoroscopic parameters were recorded and compared across institutions where appropriate using one-way ANOVA with p ≤ 0.05 being considered significant. Results: Videofluoroscopy of the pharynx and upper esophageal sphincter is performed either in right lateral or standing postures depending on the institution. Bolus size and consistency used during contrast videofluoroscopy of swallowing differs between institutions. Some institutions evaluate videofluoroscopic studies using qualitative criteria while others apply quantitative measures. Reported quantitative measures include inter-swallow interval, swallow rate, jaw cycles per swallow ratio, time to upper esophageal opening, maximal pharyngeal contraction, maximum laryngeal excursion, upper esophageal closure, epiglottic re-opening, and pharyngeal constriction ratio. Measurement outcomes are significantly different between institutions and when bolus size/consistency is variable when assessing healthy dogs. Conclusions: The current peer-reviewed literature on fluoroscopic evaluation of the pharynx and UES in dogs shows a lack of standardization regarding imaging protocol. There is not a standard set of quantitative criteria applied amongst the institutions and there are significant differences in the outcomes obtained from videofluoroscopic assessment of swallowing suggesting significant inter-observer or inter-institutional variability. A consensus statement regarding imaging protocol and what parameters should be used to interpret airway and swallowing videofluoroscopic studies of the pharynx and UES in dogs is needed along with targeted analysis of observer variability.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.cmi.2019.06.009},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Parasitic infections are responsible for a significant burden of disease worldwide as a result of international travel and immigration. More accurate diagnostic tools are necessary in support to parasite control and elimination programmes in endemic regions as well as for rapid case detection in non-endemic areas. Digital PCR (dPCR) is a powerful technology with recent applications in parasitology. AIMS: This review provides for the first time an overview of dPCR as a novel technology applied to detection of parasitic infections, and highlights the most relevant potential benefits of this assay. SOURCES: Peer-reviewed literature pertinent to this review based on PubMed, Cochrane and Embase databases as well as laboratory experience of authors. CONTENT: Among the 86 studies retrieved, 17 used the dPCR applied to parasites belonging to protozoa (8), helminths (8) and arthropods (1) of clinical human interest. dPCR was adopted in four studies, respectively, for Plasmodium and Schistosoma japonicum. dPCR led to clear advantages over quantitative real-time PCR in P. falciparum and spp., and in S. japonicum showing higher sensitivity; and in Cryptosporidium with higher stability to inhibitors from stool. For all parasites, dPCR allows absolute quantitation without the need of a standard curve. Various dPCR platforms were used. A few critical factors need consideration: DNA load, choice of platform and reaction optimization. IMPLICATIONS: Owing to its sensitivity and quantitative characteristics, dPCR is a potential candidate to become an appealing new method among the molecular technologies for parasite detection and quantitative analysis in the future. In general, it has more applications than genomic DNA detection only, such as quantitation in mixed infections, gene expression and mutation analysis. dPCR should be considered in malaria screening and diagnosis as a complement to routine assays and in schistosomiasis elimination programmes. Standardized strategies and further studies are needed for the integration of dPCR in routine clinical laboratory.},

The database was consisted of 51 scientific papers published in peer-reviewed journals. The dependent variables for meta-analysis included final body weight, average daily gain, daily feed intake, feed conversion ratio, vitamin E concentration in the muscle, tissue polyunsaturated fatty acid concentration, lipid peroxidation value, post mortem pH, heterophil to lymphocyte ratio, and total immunoglobulins. Linear mixed models were used to analyze the data. Vitamin E supplementation did not influence growth performance, as the estimated slopes were not different from zero, with P-values equal to 0.92 for final body weight, 0.81 for average daily gain, 0.31 for daily feed intake, and 0.83 for feed conversion ratio. Dietary vitamin E supplementation increased the vitamin E content in the muscle (P=0.001), did not change the polyunsaturated fatty acid concentration, and decreased the lipid peroxidation (P=0.01). The immune response was improved, the heterophil to lymphocyte ratio was constant, and the total immunoglobulins were increased (P=0.037) by dietary vitamin E supplementation. With regard to broiler chicken performance, there seemed to be no relationship between dietary vitamin E supplementation and growth performance. There is ample indication that meat quality and immune response could be improved by dietary vitamin E supplementation.},

	abstract = {Background: Antimicrobial resistance is a serious public health problem worldwide. We aimed to investigate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli strains simultaneously isolated from humans, animals, food, and the environment. Methods: Studies on PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library published from January 1, 2000 to January 1, 2018 were searched. The quality of the included studies was assessed by the modified critical appraisal checklist recommended by the Joanna Briggs Institute. All analyses were conducted using Biostat's Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 2.0. Depending on the heterogeneity test for each antibiotic, we used a random- or fixed-effect model for pooled prevalence of drug resistance. Studies were eligible if they had investigated and reported resistance in two or more isolation sources (human, animal, food, or environment). To decrease heterogeneity and bias, we excluded studies that had reported E. coli drug resistance isolated from one source only. We included publications that reported drug resistance with minimum inhibitory concentration or disk diffusion method (DDM) as antibiotic-susceptibility tests. Results: Of the 39 included studies, 20 used the DDM and 19 minimum inhibitory concentration for their antibiotic-susceptibility testing. Colistin had the lowest prevalence, with 0.8\% (95\% CI 0.2\%-3.8\%) and amoxicillin the highest, with 70.5\% (95\% CI 57.5\%-81\%) in isolated human E. coli strains tested with the DDM. To assess historical changes in antimicrobial drug resistance, subgroup analysis from 2000 to 2018 showed a significant increase in ciprofloxacin resistance. Conclusion: Monitoring and evaluating antibiotic-sensitivity patterns and preparation of reliable antibiotic strategies may lead to better outcomes for inhibition and control of E. coli infections in different regions of the world.},

Methods: Research articles found through a systematic literature search were assessed for eligibility, and data were extracted and analyzed using random-effects analysis. Results: A total of 15 observational prospective and retrospective studies including 258,298 dogs, cats, rabbits, and pigs were included. The analysis found consistency between the studies showing that dogs, cats and rabbits with an ASA-PS ≥III had 3.26 times (95\% CI = 3.04-3.49), 4.83 times (95\% CI = 3.10-7.53), and 11.31 times (95\% CI = 2.70-47.39), respectively, the risk of anesthesia-related death within 24 h (dogs) and 72 h (cats and rabbits) after anesthesia compared with those with an ASA PS {\textless}III. In addition, the analysis showed that dogs and cats with ASA PS ≥III had 2.34 times the risk of developing severe hypothermia during anesthesia (95\% CI = 1.82-3.01). Conclusions: The simple and practical ASA PS was shown to be a valuable prognostic tool and can be recommended to identify an increased risk of anesthetic mortality until 24-72 h after anesthesia, and a greater risk of development severe intraoperative hypothermia.},

OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between compressive pressure and its duration in cauda equina compression, and the effects of subsequent decompression, on neurophysiological function, and pathophysiology in animal studies. We further aim to investigate these relationships with systemic blood pressure to assess whether a vascular component in the underlying mechanism may contribute to the clinical heterogeneity of this disease. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The complex relationship between preoperative factors and outcomes in cauda equina syndrome (CES) suggests heterogeneity within CES which may inform better understanding of pathophysiological process, their effect on neurological function, and prognosis. METHODS: Systematic review identified 17 relevant studies including 422 animals and reporting electrophysiological measures (EP), histopathology, and blood flow. Modeling using meta-regression analyzed the relationship between compressive pressure, duration of compression, and electrophysiological function in both compression and decompression studies. RESULTS: Modeling suggested that electrophysiological dysfunction in acute cauda equina compression has a sigmoidal response, with particularly deterioration when mean arterial blood pressure is exceeded and, additionally, sustained for approximately 1 hour. Accounting for pressure and duration may help risk-stratify patients pre-decompression. Outcomes after decompression appeared to be related more to the degree of compression, where exceeding systolic blood pressure tended to result in an irreversible lesion, rather than duration of compression. Prognosis was most strongly associated with residual pre-decompression function. CONCLUSION: Compressive pressure influences effects and outcomes of cauda equina compression. We suggest the presence of two broad phenotypic groups within CES defined by the degree of ischaemia as a potential explanatory pathophysiological mechanism. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 1.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a growing interest in exploring the nature of communication in veterinary medicine and understanding how veterinary practitioners communicate with their clients and other professionals. This is the first integrative review of literature on veterinary communication. Applying the PRISMA model, the PubMed, PsychInfo and ERIC databases were searched using keywords such as 'veterinary', 'vet', 'communication' and 'interaction' for related articles published between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2018. RESULTS: Keyword searching through the databases yielded 1572 related studies. Only 48 of these studies were included in our analysis after an in-depth review by two independent reviewers using the critical appraisal skills Programme frameworks with high inter-rater reliability (Cohen's kappa coefficient κ {\textgreater} 0.8). The existing body of research on veterinary communication can be classified into three major areas: (a) client-veterinarian communication, (b) cross-disciplinary communication in a professional veterinarian team and (c) training of veterinary communication skills. This review details the complexity and heterogeneity of agenda in the field of veterinary communication. The included studies indicate that veterinary practitioners are not equipped with specific communication skills to address different agendas in veterinary communication. The veterinary curriculum should include a component on communication training that can help veterinary students acquire necessary communication skills that allow them to effectively communicate with clients and other professionals CONCLUSION: This review detailed the complexity of agendas in the field of veterinary communication. The results indicate that veterinary practitioners can further benefit from training on specific communication skills that address the agendas found in veterinary communication research. Furthermore, the veterinary curriculum should include a component on communication training that equips veterinary students with the necessary communication skills that allow them to effectively communicate with different stakeholders such as clients and colleagues with and across the field of veterinary science.},

	abstract = {A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to predict and identify ways to increase conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) formation in ruminant-derived products to treat human health issues with dietary tannins. The objective was to compare and confirm the effects of dietary tannins on CLA formation by analyzing in vitro and/or in vivo studies. We reported the results of the meta-analysis based on numerical data from 38 selected publications consisting of 3712 treatments. Generally, via multiple pathways, the CLA formation increased when dietary tannins increased. Concurrently, dietary tannins increased Δ9 desaturation and the CLA indices in milk and meat (P {\textless} 0.05 and P {\textless} 0.001, with average R2 values of 0.23 and 0.44, respectively), but they did not change the rumen fermentation characteristics, including total volatile fatty acids (mmol/L) and their acid components. In vitro observations may accurately predict in vivo results. Unfortunately, there was no relationship between in vitro observations and in vivo results (R2 {\textless} 0.10), indicating that it is difficult to predict CLA formation in vivo considering in vitro observations. According to the statistical meta-analysis results regarding animal aspects, the ranges of tannin levels required for CLA formation in vitro and in vivo were approximately 0.1-20 g/kg dry matter (DM) (P {\textless} 0.001) and 2.1-80 g/kg DM (P {\textless} 0.001), respectively.

	abstract = {Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is the commonest food allergy in infancy and is associated with significant health burden. Given their immune modulatory properties, probiotics have been proposed as a strategy for management of CMPA. We aimed to systematically review efficacy and safety of probiotics in the management of CMPA. Databases PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Library, and Google scholar were searched in August 2018 for randomized controlled trials (RCT) of probiotic supplementation as an adjunct in the management of infants with suspected/proven CMPA. Primary outcomes were resolution of hematochezia and acquisition of tolerance to CMP at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. Secondary outcomes included effect on allergic symptoms (SCORAD index), growth, gut microbiota, and adverse effects. A total of 10 RCTs (n = 845; probiotics, 422; control, 423) with low to unclear risk of bias were included. Meta-analysis showed probiotic supplementation was not associated with earlier resolution of hematochezia (n = 87; RR: 1.45 (95\% CI: 0.96-2.18), p = 0.08; level of evidence (LOE), very low), in presumed CMPA. In confirmed CMPA, probiotics were associated with higher rate of acquisition of tolerance to CMP at the end of 3 years compared with placebo (N = 493; RR, 1.47; 95\% CI, (1.17-1.84); p = 0.0009; LOE, low]. Meta-analysis was not possible for other outcomes. There were no probiotic related adverse effects. Conclusion: Limited low-quality evidence indicates that probiotic supplementation may be associated with earlier acquisition of tolerance to CMP in children with CMPA. Large well-designed trials are essential to confirm these findings. What is Known: • Cow's milk protein allergy (CMPA) is one of the commonest food allergies in children. CMPA is associated with significant socioeconomic burden. • Elimination diet and extensively hydrolyzed formula is the mainstay of the management of CMPA. What is New: • This first systematic review of randomized controlled trials shows that probiotics as an adjuvant can lead to earlier acquisition of tolerance to CMP in children at 36 months of age. However, the evidence is low quality and influenced by data from one large study. • Probiotic supplementation was not associated with earlier resolution of hematochezia.},

In order to fully evaluate the seroprevalence and risk factor of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection among in mainland China, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. In this review, we searched literature on the seroprevalence of H5N1 infection among humans in mainland China from 1 January 1997 to 20 October 2018 in English and Chinese databases, including PubMed, Google scholar, Cochrane library, Clinical Trial, VIP, CNKI and WanFang database. We made a selection according to the title and the abstract of paper, and then, we excluded duplicated literature, and data incomplete literature according to the exclusion criteria we formulated. Finally, we extracted how many humans have H5N1 infection from the obtained studies to establish the seroprevalence of H5N1 infection among humans in mainland China. A total of 56 studies (including data of 35,159 humans) were compliant with our criteria. In China, the overall seroprevalence of H5N1 infection among humans was 2.45\% (862/35,159), while the seroprevalence of H5N1 infection among humans from central China was 7.32\% (213/2,911), higher than those in other regions of China. The seroprevalence of H5N1 infection was associated with test method, sampling time and demographic characteristics of humans. However, there was no significant difference in the effect of gender on the seroprevalence of H5N1 among humans in China. The purpose of this review was to better understand the real infection rate of H5N1 virus among humans and evaluate the potential risk factors for the zoonotic spread of H5N1 virus to humans.

	abstract = {Since 2004, the national schistosomiasis control strategy in China has shifted from the morbidity control strategy (conventional strategy) to an integrated strategy (new strategy). We investigated the effectiveness of the new strategy and compared it against the conventional strategy. We retrieved from electronic databases the literature regarding the new strategy published from 2000 to 2017. The effect of the new or conventional strategy on infection by Schistosoma japonicum of humans and snails (Oncomelania hupensis) was evaluated with pooled log relative risk (logRR). A total of only eight eligible publications were included in the final meta-analysis. The results showed that implementation of the new strategy reduced the infection risk by 3-4 times relative to the conventional strategy. More specifically, the conventional strategy caused a reduction in both human (logRR = 0.56, 95\% CI: 0.12-0.99) and snail infections (logRR = 0.34, 95\% CI: -0.69-1.37), while the new strategy also significantly reduced both human (logRR = 1.89, 95\% CI: 1.33-2.46) and snail infections (logRR = 1.61, 95\% CI: 1.06-2.15). In contrast to the conventional strategy, the new strategy appeared more effective to control both human (logRR difference = 1.32, 95\% CI: 0.78-1.86) and snail infections (logRR difference = 1.53, 95\% CI: 0.76-2.31). Our data demonstrate that the new integrated strategy is highly effective to control the transmission of S. japonicum in China, and this strategy is recommended for schistosomiasis elimination in other affected regions across the world, with adaptation to local conditions.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Spinal cord injury (SCI) has long been a subject of great interest in a wide range of scientific fields. Several attempts have been made to demonstrate motor function improvement in rats with SCI after transplantation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). This systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to summarize the effects of iPSC on locomotor recovery in rat models of SCI. METHODS: We searched the publications in the PubMed, Medline, Science Citation Index, Cochrane Library, CNKI, and Wan-fang databases and the China Biology Medicine disc. Results were analyzed by Review Manager 5.3.0. The quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. RESULTS: Six randomized controlled preclinical trials covering eight comparisons and including 212 rats were selected. The subgroup analyses were based on the following items: different SCI models, cell counts, iPSC sources, iPSC differentiations and transplantation methods. The pooled results indicated that iPSC transplantation significantly improved locomotor recovery of rats after SCI by sustaining beneficial effects, especially in the subgroups of contusion, moderate cell counts (5×105), source of human fetal lung fibroblasts, iPSC-neural precursors and intraspinal injection. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis of the effects of iPSC transplantation on locomotor function in SCI models is, to our knowledge, the first meta-analysis in this field. We conclude that iPSC transplantation improves locomotor recovery in rats with SCI, implicating this strategy as an effective therapy. However, more studies are required to validate our conclusions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of myelotomy on locomotor recovery in rats subjected to spinal cord injury. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases including PubMed, Science Citation Index, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Journals Full-text Database, China Biology Medicine disc, and Wanfang Database were searched to retrieve related studies published before September 2017. The MeSH terms (the Medical Subject Headings) such as "myelotomy", "spinal cord injuries", "rats", "randomized controlled trial" and all related entry terms were searched. DATA SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials using myelotomy for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury in rats were included. Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores were adopted as the evaluation method. RevMan Software (version 5.3) was used for data processing. The χ(2) and I(2) tests were used to assess heterogeneity. Using a random-effects model, a subgroup analysis was conducted to analyze the source of the heterogeneity. OUTCOME MEASURES: Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores were observed 1-6 weeks after spinal cord injury. RESULTS: Six animal trials were included, using a total of 143 lab rats. The included trials were divided into two subgroups by injury degrees (moderate or severe). The pooled results showed that, 1-6 weeks after spinal cord injury, the overall Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan score was significantly higher in the myelotomy group than in the contusion group (weighted mean difference (WMD) = 0.60; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.23-0.97; P = 0.001; WMD = 2.10; 95\% CI: 1.56-2.64; P {\textless} 0.001; WMD = 2.65; 95\% CI: 1.73-3.57; P {\textless} 0.001; WMD = 1.66; 95\% CI: 0.80-2.52; P {\textless} 0.001; WMD = 2.09; 95\% CI: 0.92-3.26, P {\textless} 0.001; WMD = 2.25; 95\% CI: 1.06-3.44, P {\textless} 0.001). The overall heterogeneity was high (I(2) = 85\%; I(2) = 95\%; I(2) = 94\%; I(2) = 88\%; I(2) = 91\%; I(2) = 89\%). The results in the moderate injury subgroup showed that Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores were significantly higher in the myelotomy group than in the contusion group (WMD = 0.91, 95\% CI: 0.52-1.3, P {\textless} 0.001; WMD = 2.10; 95\% CI: 1.56-2.64, P {\textless} 0.001; WMD = 2.65; 95\% CI: 1.73-3.57, P {\textless} 0.001; WMD = 2.50, 95\% CI: 1.72-3.28, P {\textless} 0.001; WMD = 3.29, 95\% CI: 2.21-4.38, P {\textless} 0.001; WMD = 3.27; 95\% CI: 2.31-4.23, P {\textless} 0.001). The relevant heterogeneity was low. However, there were no significant differences in Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores between the myelotomy and contusion groups in the severe injury subgroup at 2 and 3 weeks after the injury (P = 0.75; P = 0.92). CONCLUSION: : To date, this is the first attempt to summarize the potential effect of myelotomy on locomotor recovery in rats with spinal cord injury. Our findings conclude that myelotomy promotes locomotor recovery in rats with spinal cord injury, especially in those with moderate injury.},

METHODS: We performed a literature search on four database (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library) through February 1, 2018 to identify prospective studies of fatty and lean fish in relation to stroke risk. A random-effects model was used to calculate the summary estimates. RESULTS: We identified five prospective studies, including 7 comparisons for fatty fish intake and 5 comparisons for lean fish intake. Compared with the highest category of intake with lowest category, the summary relative risk was 0.88 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.74-1.04] for fatty fish intake and 0.81 (95\% CI, 0.67-0.99) for lean fish intake. No heterogeneity across studies and publication bias were observed. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that fatty and lean fish intake has beneficial effects on stroke risk, especially lean fish intake.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis japonica is a zoonotic parasitic disease. After nearly 70 years of control efforts in China, Schistosomiasis transmission has been reduced to a much lower level. The absence or near absence of infections in humans or livestock, based on traditional fecal and serological tests, has made the targets and priorities of future control efforts difficult to determine. However, detection of schistosome cercariae in waters using sentinel mice could be an alternative way of identifying remaining foci of infection, or even serve as a tool for evaluation of control efficacy. This method has been employed in China over last forty years. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of the relevant research to investigate if infections in sentinel mice mirror the ongoing trend of schistosomiasis transmission in China. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of studies reporting infection rates of S. japonicum in sentinel mice in China before Sep 1, 2018 in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We retrieved all relative studies based on five databases (CNKI, WanFang, VIP, PubMed and Web of Science) and the reference lists of resulting articles. For each individual study, the infection rate in sentinel mice is presented together with its 95\% confidence interval (CI). Point estimates of the overall infection rates and their 95\% CIs were calculated. Subgroup analyses were performed according to study periods, seasons or regions. RESULTS: We identified 90 articles, including 290 studies covering eight endemic provinces. The overall rate in sentinel mice was 12.31\% (95\% CI: 10.14-14.65\%) from 1980 to 2018. The value of 3.66\% (95\% CI: 2.62-4.85\%) estimated in 2004 to 2018 was significantly lower than in 1980 to 2003 (22.96\%, 95\% CI: 19.25-26.89\%). The estimate was significantly higher in the middle and lower reaches than in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The highest estimates were obtained in Hunan (30.11\%, 95\% CI: 25.64-34.77\%) followed by Anhui (26.34\%, 95\% CI: 12.88-42.44\%) and then Jiangxi (13.73\%, 95\% CI: 6.71-22.56\%). Unlike the other provinces in the middle and lower reaches, no significant reduction was seen in Hubei after 2003. Even in Hubei two studies carried out after 2014 reported infections in sentinel mice, although no infected snails were reported across the province. Infections were most found in April (17.40\%, 95\% CI: 1.13-45.49\%), July (24.98\%, 95\% CI: 15.64-35.62\%) and October (17.08\%, 95\% CI 5.94-32.05\%). High degrees of heterogeneity were observed. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis provides a comprehensive analysis of schistosome infection in sentinel mice across China. The estimates largely mirror the ongoing trends of transmission in terms of periods and regions. Infections were most likely to occur in April, July and October. In areas where no infected snails were reported infections in sentinel mice were still observed. Due to the presence of snails and infected wildlife, detection of schistosomes in waters using such a highly sensitive method as the deployment of sentinel mice, remains of importance in schistosomiasis monitoring. We would suggest the current criteria for transmission interruption or elimination of schistosomiasis in China be adjusted by integrating the results of sentinel mice based surveys.},

A total of 1052 articles were separated after literature search. After a strict selection according to our criteria, 82 articles were included in qualitative synthesis and ultimately 52 studies were included in quantitative synthesis. Three species of microsporidia were confirmed to exist in China, including Enterocytozoon bieneusi (E. bieneusi), Nosema and Encephalitozoon cuniculi (E. cuniculi). The highest overall estimated prevalence of E. bieneusi in humans was 8.1\%, which was observed in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients (AIDS). Moreover, the prevalence of E. bieneusi in animals including the cattle, dogs, pigs, deer, sheep and goats were analyszed in this study.

	abstract = {Acid-sensitive ion channels, such as amiloride-sensitive cation channel (ACCN), transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1), and T-cell death-associated gene 8 (TDAG8) are highly related to the expression of fear and are expressed in several regions of the brain. These molecules can detect acidosis and maintain brain homeostasis. An important role of pH homeostasis has been suggested in the physiology of panic disorder (PD), with acidosis as an interoceptive trigger for panic attacks. To examine the effect of acid-sensitive channels on PD symptoms, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of these chemosensors in rodents and humans. Following PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched the Web of Science, Medline/Pubmed, Scopus, Science Direct, and SciELO databases. The review included original research in PD patients and animal models of PD that investigated acid-sensitive channels and PD symptoms. Studies without a control group, studies involving patients with a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, and in vitro studies were excluded. Eleven articles met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. The majority of the studies showed an association between panic symptoms and acid-sensitive channels. PD patients appear to display polymorphisms in the ACCN gene and elevated levels of TDAG8 mRNA. The results showed a decrease in panic-like symptoms after acid channel blockade in animal models. Despite the relatively limited data on this topic in the literature, our review identified evidence linking acid-sensitive channels to PD in humans and preclinical models. Future research should explore possible underlying mechanisms of this association, attempt to replicate the existing findings in larger populations, and develop new therapeutic strategies based on these biological features.},

Microglia transform from the resting to the activated state by sensing their environment, aided by a variety of ion channels.

A systematic search of the PubMed and Web of Science electronic databases using the PRISMA and WHO methodologies for systematic reviews yielded 15 original peer-reviewed studies. The majority (13 out of 15) of these studies reported a decrease in microglial activated state after ion signaling pharmacological blockade. The studies provide evidence that acute administration of ion channel antagonists leads to a reduction in microglial activation in rodent brains in the models for epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, inflammation, pain, ischemia, and brain and spinal cord injury. Future research should explore microglial-specific druggable targets for neurological and psychiatric disorders. The investigation of acute and chronic administration of ion channel antagonists in microglial phenotypes in primates and the development of microglia-like cells derived from human stem cells could be valuable sources in this direction.},

In addition, inorganic selenium resulted in higher concentrations in kidney (2.74 ppm) and blood (0.157 ppm), and the organic form allowed more selenium to be concentrated in liver (0.568 ppm) and muscle (0.237 ppm). However, the effect was not consistent among studies which was reflected by high values in the inconsistency test ({\textgreater}72\%). The tissue concentration of selenium is affected by the number of repetitions, animals per experimental unit, individuals sampled per experimental unit and by the supplemented selenium level.

	abstract = {Coxiella burnetii is an obligate intracellular zoonotic bacterium that causes Q fever. Ruminants, including cattle, are broadly known to be reservoirs for this bacterium. Since 2006, many research groups have evaluated the herd-level prevalence of C. burnetii in cattle by molecular techniques on composite milk samples. This study explored the global C. burnetii herd-level prevalence from studies done on bovine bulk-tank milk (BTM) samples using PCR-based analysis. Also, moderators were investigated to identify sources of heterogeneity. Databases (CAB Abstracts, Medline via Ovid, PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar) were searched for index articles on C. burnetii prevalence in BTM samples by PCR published between January-1973 and November-2018. Numerous studies (1054) were initially identified, from which seventeen original publications were included in the meta-analysis based on the pre-defined selection criteria. These studies comprised 4031 BTM samples from twelve countries. A random-effects model was used because of considerable heterogeneity (I (2) = 98\%) to estimate the herd-level prevalence of C. burnetii as 37.0\%(CI(95\%)25.2-49.5\%). The average herd size appeared to account for a high level of the heterogeneity. No other moderators (geographic location, gross national income or notification criteria for Q fever) seemed to be determinant. This systematic evaluation demonstrated a high molecular prevalence of C. burnetii in BTM samples both in European and non-European countries, evidencing a widespread herd-level circulation of this agent in bovine dairy farms around the world. Meta-regression showed herd size as the most relevant moderator with the odds of a BTM sample testing positive doubling with every unit increase.},

	abstract = {Background: Rodents are reservoirs and hosts for several zoonotic diseases such as plague, leptospirosis, and leishmaniasis. Rapid development of industry and agriculture, as well as climate change throughout the globe, has led to change or increase in occurrence of rodent-borne diseases. Considering the distribution of rodents throughout Iran, the aim of this review is to assess the risk of rodent-borne diseases in Iran. Methodology/Principal finding: We searched Google Scholar, PubMed, Science Direct, Scientific Information Database (SID), and Magiran databases up to September 2016 to obtain articles reporting occurrence of rodent-borne diseases in Iran and extract information from them. Out of 70 known rodent-borne diseases, 34 were reported in Iran: 17 (50\%) parasitic diseases, 13 (38\%) bacterial diseases, and 4 (12\%) viral diseases. Twenty-one out of 34 diseases were reported from both humans and rodents. Among the diseases reported in the rodents of Iran, plague, leishmaniasis, and hymenolepiasis were the most frequent. The most infected rodents were Rattus norvegicus (16 diseases), Mus musculus (14 diseases), Rattus rattus (13 diseases), Meriones persicus (7 diseases), Apodemus spp. (5 diseases), Tatera indica (4 diseases), Meriones libycus (3 diseases), Rhombomys opimus (3 diseases), Cricetulus migratorius (3 diseases), and Nesokia indica (2 diseases). Conclusions/Significance: The results of this review indicate the importance of rodent-borne diseases in Iran. Considering notable diversity of rodents and their extensive distribution throughout the country, it is crucial to pay more attention to their role in spreading infectious diseases for better control of the diseases.},

Here we reviewed 10,090 abstracts and extracted data from 71 studies reported in 58 relevant publications, to assess quantitatively whether phenotypic trait changes associated with climate change are adaptive in animals. A meta-analysis focussing on birds, the taxon best represented in our dataset, suggests that global warming has not systematically affected morphological traits, but has advanced phenological traits. We demonstrate that these advances are adaptive for some species, but imperfect as evidenced by the observed consistent selection for earlier timing. Application of a theoretical model indicates that the evolutionary load imposed by incomplete adaptive responses to ongoing climate change may already be threatening the persistence of species.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Obesity is a major risk factor for several diseases, including metabolic syndrome (MetS), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). The use of natural products, such as astaxanthin (ASX), a potent antioxidant compound produced by the freshwater green microalga Haematococcus pluvialis, has gained particular interest to reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, and to improve redox status, often associated with obesity. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to comprehensively examine the effects of ASX in animal models of diet induced obesity-associated diseases in order to inform the design of future human clinical studies for ASX use as supplement or nutraceutical. METHODS: Cinahl, Cochraine, MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for English-language manuscripts published between January 2000 and April 2020 using the following key words: astaxanthin, obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, NAFLD and metabolic. RESULTS: Seventeen eligible articles, corresponding to 21 animal studies, were included in the final quantitative analysis. ASX, at different concentrations and administered for different length of time, induced a significant reduction in adipose tissue weight (P = 0.05) and systolic blood pressure (P {\textless} 0.0001) in control animals. In animal models of T2D, ASX significantly reduced serum glucose levels (P = 0.04); whereas it improved several disease biomarkers in the blood (e.g. cholesterol, triglycerides, ALT and AST, P {\textless} 0.10), and reduced liver (P = 0.0002) and body weight (P = 0.11), in animal models of NAFLD. CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation of ASX in the diet has positive effects on symptoms associated with obesity related diseases in animals, by having lipid-lowering, hypo-insulin and hypoglycaemic capacity, protecting organs from oxidative stress and mitigating the immune system, as suggested in this review.},

	abstract = {Altered activity of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), an enzyme of the endocannabinoid system, has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). It is speculated that increased brain FAAH expression is correlated with increased depressive symptoms. The aim of this scoping review was to establish the role of FAAH expression in animal models of depression to determine the translational potential of targeting FAAH in clinical studies. A literature search employing multiple databases was performed; all original articles that assessed FAAH expression in animal models of depression were considered. Of the 216 articles that were screened for eligibility, 24 articles met inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Three key findings emerged: (1) FAAH expression is significantly increased in depressive-like phenotypes; (2) genetic knockout or pharmacological inhibition of FAAH effectively reduces depressive-like behavior, with a dose-dependent effect; and (3) differences in FAAH expression in depressive-like phenotypes were largely localized to animal prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. We conclude, based on the animal literature, that a positive relationship can be established between brain FAAH level and expression of depressive symptoms. In summary, we suggest that FAAH is a tractable target for developing novel pharmacotherapies for MDD.},

To date, no systematic review or meta-analysis has been published in this area, so we examined all relevant published studies on rodents to elucidate the overall effects of gene therapy on bodyweight, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT), fasting blood glucose, and insulin in animals with type 1 DM. The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, ISI Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar were systematically searched for potentially relevant studies. Mean±standard deviation (SD) was pooled using a random-effects model. After the primary search, out of 528 studies identified, 16 studies were in concordance with predefined criteria and selected for the final assessment. Of these, 12 studies used viral manipulation, and 4 employed non-viral vectors for gene delivery. The meta-analysis showed gene therapy with a viral vector decreased mean IPGTT (-12.69 mmol/l, P{\textless}0.001), fasting blood glucose (-13.51 mmol/l, P{\textless}0.001), insulin (398.28 pmol/l, P{\textless}0.001), and bodyweight (24.22 g, P{\textless}0.001), whereas non-viral vectors reduced fasting glucose (-29.95 mmol/l, P{\textless}0.001) and elevated insulin (114.92 pmol/l, P{\textless}0.001).

Also, the carcinogenic risk was estimated by calculating hazard index (HI) using the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The result of conducted meta-analysis for 49 articles containing 7484 data indicated that the rank order of type of milk based on the concentration of aflatoxin M$_{\textrm{1}}$ was Ultra-high temperature processing (UHT) milk (82.57 ng/kg) {\textgreater} raw milk (60.37 ng/kg) {\textgreater} pasteurized milk (PAS) (45.81 ng/kg). The pooled concentration of aflatoxin M$_{\textrm{1}}$ in raw and UHT milk was higher than EC (European Committee, 50 ng/kg) standard limit. The rank order of countries based on the concentration of aflatoxin M$_{\textrm{1}}$ in raw milk was Syria {\textgreater} Turkey {\textgreater} Iran {\textgreater} Egypt {\textgreater} Lebanon {\textgreater} Palestine; pasteurized milk, Turkey {\textgreater} Iran {\textgreater} Lebanon; and UHT milk, Iran {\textgreater} Turkey {\textgreater} Saudi Arabia. The overall prevalence of aflatoxin M$_{\textrm{1}}$ in the raw milk of Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, Palestine, Egypt, and Syria was identified as 76\%, 12\%, 67\%, 85\%, 38\%, and 14\%; pasteurized milk, in the Iran, Lebanon, and Turkey was 77\%, 36\%, and 11\%; and finally UHT milk in Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey was 81\%, 82\%, and 62\%, respectively. HI in the adult's consumer's raw milk in the Iran, Turkey, Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, and Egypt were calculated as 0.26, 0.47, 0.52, 0.34, 0.23 and 0.18; However, the HI for adult consumers of pasteurized milk in the Iran, Turkey, and Lebanon were 0.28, 0.31 and 0.11. Also, the measured HI for adult consumers of UHT milk in the Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Iran was 0.20, 0.33 and 0.50, respectively.

The calculated HI for consumers of pasteurized milk in the children age group of the pasteurized milk in of Iran, Turkey, and Lebanon were 1.30, 1.56, and 0.50. Finally, in term of UHT milk in Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Iran were 0.94, 1.44 and 2.35, respectively.

	abstract = {Human consumption of fish protein, including canned tuna fish, is increasing steadily worldwide. However, there are some concerns about the potential exposure to elevated concentrations of metals in canned tuna fish. Several studies have been conducted in Iran regarding the concentration of metals in seafood, including copper (Cu), selenium (Se), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), nickel (Ni), tin (Sn), and cadmium (Cd) in canned tuna fish. The main aim of this study was to gather data from existing papers and to perform a meta-analysis of the pooled concentrations of metals to evaluate their non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks in children and adults consumers. Search was conducted retrieving data from the international biomedical databases with highly public access and consultation, e.g., Web of Science, PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus, and national database (SID and Irandoc) between 1983 and November of 2017. Data from 23 articles and 1295 samples were assessed and extracted. The ranking order of metals based on mean concentrations (μg/g wet weight) were Fe (13.17) {\textgreater} Zn (9.31) {\textgreater} Se (2.23) {\textgreater} Al (1.8) {\textgreater} Cr (1.63) {\textgreater} Cu (1.52) {\textgreater} As (0.38) {\textgreater} Ni (0.33) {\textgreater} Pb (0.24) {\textgreater} Cd (0.14) {\textgreater} Hg (0.11) {\textgreater} Sn (0.1). Except for Cd and Se, concentrations of other metals in the canned tuna fish were lower than the limits recommended by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and Iran National Standards Organization (INSO). The minimum and maximum target hazard quotient (THQ) for adults were 5.55E-5 for Al and 2.23E-08 for Cr. For children, they were 7.23E-05 for Al and 2.91E-08 for Cr. THQ, and total target hazard quotient (TTHQ) were ≤1.0 for adult and children consumers. The Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR) of As was 3.21E-5 in adults and 4.18E-5 in children. Adults and children that consume canned tuna fish in Iran are not at non-carcinogenic risk but have a carcinogenic risk due to As.},

	abstract = {Histamine is one of the most important health issues associated with consumption of canned tuna because of possible allergic and anaphylactic reactions in consumers. Although the concentrations of histamine in tuna in Iran have been investigated in several studies, definitive conclusions are elusive. This study was undertaken as a systematic review and meta-analysis of the concentration and prevalence of histamine in Iranian canned tuna, and the related health risk was assessed. An extensive search of articles in the databases Scopus, PubMed, and Scientific Information Database resulted in 11 articles and a total of 693 samples for inclusion in this review. The minimum and maximum concentrations of histamine were determined as 8.59 ± 14.24 and 160.52 ± 87.59 mg kg(−1), respectively. The mean concentration was calculated as 77.86 mg kg(−1) (95\% confidence interval [CI], 47.51 to 108.21 mg kg(−1)), which was lower than the 200 mg kg(−1) recommended limit by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The mean prevalence of histamine was 9.19\% (95\%; CI, 6.88 to 11.5\%). The 95\% value of the target hazard quotient for adult consumers was calculated as 0.10. In all studies performed in Iran, the concentration of histamine in canned tuna was lower than FDA standard. Health risk assessment indicated low histamine risk (target hazard quotient {\textless} 1) for adults in Iran from consumption of canned tuna.},

	abstract = {The infective stage of Anisakidae nematodes responsible for allergic reactions in humans is found in a variety of edible fish and cephalopods. The identification of geographical regions that are high risk for infected seafood may help prevent allergic reactions in humans. Despite an abundance of published literature which has identified anisakid larvae in an array of edible seafood as well as scattered reports of human allergic anisakiasis, the relationship between the two has not been fully explored. Therefore, a systematic spatio-temporal study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Anisakis spp. in fish from January 2000 to August 2020 firstly to explore the relationship between fish infection and cases of allergic anisakiasis and secondly to use fish infection data to map potential allergic anisakiasis 'hot spots'. A systematic literature search for original English text articles was conducted through search engines, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar. Out of 3228 articles which describe anisakid infection in fish, 264 were used for data extraction. Of 904 articles describing allergic anisakiasis, 37 were used for data extraction. A qualitative summary of the extracted data was performed using equal interval method (ArcMap software) in order to compare the global distribution of Anisakis-infected fish. Of the 152-identified fish hosts, five families were most commonly infected with Anisakis spp. These included Lophiidae (86.9\%), Trichiuridae (77.05\%), Zeidae (70.9\%), Merlucciidae (67.8\%) and Gadidae (56.8\%). The hot spot areas for allergic anisakiasis were North and northeast of Atlantic Ocean, southwest of USA, west of Mexico, south of Chile, east of Argentina, Norway, UK and west of Iceland (confidence 99\%). The highest rate of allergic anisakiasis was in Portugal and Norway with the prevalence rate of 18.45-22.50\%. Allergologists should consider allergic anisakiasis as a public health issue particularly in high-risk countries where high prevalences in fish have been demonstrated.},

	abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is one of the major zoonotic concerns of the world, as milk and meat from cattle are major products for human consumption. Bovine tuberculosis not only affects the health of cattle and poses an imminent zoonotic threat, but also causes significant economic loss in both developed and developing countries. This systematic review reports the prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) organisms in slaughtered cattle showing tuberculosis-like lesion (TBL) with available literature worldwide. Appropriate keywords were used to search various databases to collect articles pertaining to slaughterhouse studies. Bovine TB prevalence, based on the prevalence of MTBC organisms in slaughtered cattle showing TBL by culture, microscopy, PCR and spoligotyping, was assessed in each study using a random-effects model and standardized mean with 95\% confidence interval (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed by the I(2) statistic. Publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots. Out of 72 hits, 37 studies were selected based on title and abstract. Ten articles were excluded due to lack of desired data, and 27 studies were included in the final analysis. From the selected articles, it was found that 426 [95\% CI: 302-560] per 1,000 slaughtered cattle with TBL were positive for the presence of MTBC organisms. The sensitivity analysis showed that no individual study alone influenced the estimation of pooled prevalence. The prevalence of MTBC organisms in slaughtered cattle showing TBL by culture, microscopy, PCR and spoligotyping was 474[95\% CI: 342-610], 385 [95\% CI: 269-515], 218 [95\% CI: 132-338], 326 [95\% CI: 229-442], respectively, per 1,000 slaughtered cattle. Most of the slaughtered cattle were from the same locality as the slaughterhouse. The results obtained in this study suggest that abattoir monitoring can give an estimate of the prevalence of bTB in that locality. This study also emphasizes the need to test cattle and animal handlers who were in contact with bTB-positive cattle.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Organophosphorus (OP) insecticide self-poisoning is a global problem, killing tens of thousands of people every year. Oxidative stress has been proposed to play a pathological role in OP poisoning, but whether it plays a direct toxic role is currently unclear.Objectives: To determine whether there is consistent evidence of oxidative stress in patients with acute OP insecticide self-poisoning, and whether there are animal or human trial data that indicate that treatment of oxidative stress provides clinical benefit, which would suggest a direct toxic effect of oxidative stress.Methods: We conducted a systematic review using the PubMed, EMBASE and MEDLINE databases, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic reviews, based upon the following search terms and keywords: "organophosphate poisoning", "oxidative stress" and "antioxidant". All articles relevant to the aims of the study were included. Articles related to chronic OP poisoning, to use of medicines without antioxidant benefits, or to subjects other than oxidative stress were excluded. The search returned 256 results of which 17 studies were considered relevant and grouped under the following categories: observational human studies (n = 11) and intervention studies in animals (n = 4) and humans (n = 2).Oxidative stress markers in human studies: Oxidative damage to lipids and proteins was reported in all eleven human studies. Eight of nine studies reported variable increases in a weak marker of lipid peroxidation, malondialdehyde. In two case-control studies, erythrocyte membrane malondialdehyde concentrations were 380\% and 160\% higher in cases than controls, while plasma malondialdehyde concentrations were ∼63\% higher in cases than controls in three case-control studies. In a prospective study, plasma malondialdehyde did not increase significantly from baseline in moderate or severely poisoned patients. Five case-control studies measured thiol residues as markers of protein oxidative damage and found variable changes after poisoning. No evidence of oxidative DNA damage was found in the one study that investigated it.Antioxidant intervention studies in animals: After treatment with an antioxidant, all four studies showed an improvement in either markers of oxidative damage or antioxidant activity. One mouse study with a relatively low risk of bias showed that administration of acetylcysteine 200 mg/kg reduced malondialdehyde by 35\% and increased survival by more than 60\%.Antioxidant intervention studies in humans: We found two small randomised controlled trials reporting the use of acetylcysteine as an adjunct to standard treatment in acute OP poisoning. The trials found that acetylcysteine reduced atropine requirements by 77\% and 55\%, but did not affect clinically relevant outcomes.Conclusions: Several studies showed evidence of OP insecticide-induced oxidative damage and antioxidant activity, suggesting that endogenous antioxidant defences are triggered in acute OP poisoning. However, the markers of lipid peroxidation used were weak, there was high inter-individual variability between studies in results and quality, and marked variation between the OP insecticides involved. Animal data provide some evidence that antioxidants alleviate adverse effects of acute poisoning, suggesting that oxidative stress may directly cause clinical harm. Acetylcysteine appeared beneficial in animal studies, but this could be mediated via increased synthesis of the endogenous detoxifying agent, glutathione, rather than through a direct antioxidant effect. The two human clinical studies were too small to provide any clear evidence to support the use of acetylcysteine in OP poisoning. Further research into the mechanisms of oxidative stress in acute OP poisoning, combined with large unambiguous clinical trials of antioxidants, are required before they can be used routinely in treatment.},

	abstract = {Exposure to malathion (an organophosphate pesticide widely used around the world) has been associated with alterations in blood glucose concentration in animal models. However, the results are inconsistent. The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate whether malathion exposure can disturb the concentrations of blood glucose in exposed rats. We performed a literature search of online databases including PubMed, EBSCO, and Google Scholar and reviewed original articles that analyzed the relation between malathion exposure and glucose levels in animal models. The selection of articles was based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The database search identified thirty-five possible articles, but only eight fulfilled our inclusion criteria, and these studies were included in the meta-analysis. The effect of malathion on blood glucose concentration showed a non-monotonic dose-response curve. In addition, pooled analysis showed that blood glucose concentrations were 3.3-fold higher in exposed rats than in the control group (95\% CI, 2-5; Z = 3.9; p {\textless} 0.0001) in a random-effect model. This result suggested that alteration of glucose homeostasis is a possible mechanism of toxicity associated with exposure to malathion.},

	abstract = {Zoonotic animal tuberculosis (TB) is a One Health paradigm infectious disease, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex bacteria, that affects different host species with varying levels of management. In most developed countries, official surveillance and control strategies support the longitudinal reporting of herd and/or animal prevalence. However, for under resourced countries without surveillance plans, this information may be obtained from cross-sectional studies only. The objective of this meta-analysis was to perform a worldwide estimate of the overall prevalence of animal TB in different livestock species whose importance in production systems varies according to the region of the world. The ISI's Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched combining keywords and related database-specific subject terms to identify relevant cohort or cross-sectional work published in this topic. A total of 443 articles were retrieved, screened, and a final set of 182 references included. Potential sources of variation were investigated using subgroup analyses and meta-regression. Prevalence estimates in five mammalian host groups were stratified according to host species, host characteristics, anatomical localization of lesions, sample size, geographical location, and diagnostic tests. The multivariable meta-regression analysis accounted for a range between 0\% (farmed wild boar) and 68.71\% (camelids) of the overall observed heterogeneity, indicating that the pondered predictors partially explain the observed variability. Differences in the overall prevalence of TB across hosts were small, with most groups showing values around 10\%, except farmed wild boar (41\%). The sample size emerged as an important moderator, with small size studies leading to the overestimation of prevalence. TB prevalence rates were very heterogeneous across continents and depended on the host, with lower values (below 10\%) in Africa and Asia, while North America (33.6\%, cattle), Europe (51\%, goats), and South America (85.7\%, pigs) exhibited higher rates, possibly related to greater densities of specific host groups managed on more intensive production systems. Stratification by diagnostic tests evidenced heterogeneous prevalence rates depending on the host group, possibly reflecting differences in test performance across different hosts. Results from this study highlight different TB burden scenarios, pinpointing host groups and diagnostics that should be prioritized in surveillance systems in different regions, thus providing policy-relevant information to catalyse TB control in settings with lower installed capacity and better resource allocation at the human-animal-environment interface.},

The epidemiological prevalence of infection associated with BVDV in dairy cattle has not been systematically assessed in China. Therefore, we undertook this study to evaluate prevalent of BVDV infection. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from papers on the BVDV incidence and prevalence in dairy cattle in China by searching China Science and Technology Journal Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wan Fang Database and PubMed for publication from March 2003 to March 2018. The 41 studies reporting the prevalence of BVDV in cattle in China were selected upon our inclusion criterion. The pooled BVDV prevalence in dairy cattle in China was estimated to 53.0\% (95\% CI 40.2-65.7) based on the data obtained from the 27,530 cows tested using serological or virological assay in the qualified papers published during the periods (χ² = 51,861.0, I(2) = 99.9\%). The highest BVDV positive rate in dairy flocks reached 90.0\% in Fujian province of China, followed by Shaanxi (88.9\%) and Shandong (83.3\%). The prevalence in the six administrative districts of China was validated to be highly variable (25.7\%-72.2\%) and reached 72.2\% in dairy cattle flocks of Northern China. Besides, the BVDV-RNA positive rate was estimated 27.1\% (95\% CI 17.3-37.0) based on 6 studies, comparatively, the pooled BVDV seroprevalence based on 35 studies was about 57.0\% (95\% CI 44.4-69.5) in China. This systematic review and meta-analysis firstly established an estimated prevalence of BVDV in dairy herds in China, indicating that the BVDV infection is escalating, though there is a bias in the number of studies between 2003-2009 and 2010-2018 timescales. This study may help understand the status of BVDV infection in dairy herds in China. Further extensive and comprehensive investigation is recommended, and effective intervention measures for preventing and controlling BVDV spread in dairy herds should be deployed, especially herds that have been exposed to BVDV.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Brucellosis remains one of the most common zoonotic diseases globally, with more than half million human cases reported annually. Brucellosis is an emerging and re-emerging disease in China since the 1990s. An infectious reservoir constituted by domestic animals with brucellosis, especially ovine and caprine herds, poses a significant threat to public health. The seroprevalence of brucellosis in sheep and goat flocks in a national context is unavailable so far. Therefore, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the overall status of brucellosis in sheep and goats in China in almost two decades. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of brucellosis in ovine and caprine flocks in China increased in 2000-2009 (1.00\%; 95\% CI, 0.70-1.30) to 2010-2018 (3.20\%; 95\% CI, 2.70-3.60). The seroprevalence of brucellosis in sheep and goat flocks was higher in Eastern China, with 7.00\% of positive rate, than that in any other region, especially Shandong province (18.70\%). Brucellosis is highly endemic in some local regions. The high prevalence of brucellosis in agricultural regions is suggestive of a shift of geographic distribution. The pooled prevalence of brucellosis is higher in goat flocks than in sheep flocks in China. CONCLUSIONS: The overall data in this meta-analysis demands comprehensive intervention measures and further surveillance to facilitate the control of brucellosis in livestock. Further studies aimed at evaluating the risk factors associated with spreads of brucellosis in domestic animals unaddressed so far, and sufficient epidemiological data is important to the exploration and understanding of the prevalent status of brucellosis throughout the country and to disease control.},

We retrieved 88 studies related to the seroprevalence of brucellosis in dairy cattle in China in which samples were harvested between 2008 and 2018. The results of our systematic review and meta-analysis reveal that the overall seroprevalence of brucellosis in dairy cattle herds in China was 1.9\% during the selected period, rising from 1.6\% in 2008-2012 to 2.6\% in 2013-2018.

At the provincial level, the highest brucellosis seroprevalence in dairy cattle was estimated at {\textgreater}30\% in Jilin province, followed by Shanxi, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, and Guizhou, each with a prevalence of 10-20\%. Additionally, the seroprevalence of brucellosis in some local areas was {\textgreater}30\% or even {\textgreater}50\%, indicating that Brucella infection was highly endemic in dairy herds in China. Our data may facilitate the prevention and control of brucellosis in domestic animals in China. Further epidemiological surveillance and the administration of a comprehensive monitoring program to determine the risk factors associated with brucellosis incidence in humans and domestic animals are recommended to refine brucellosis control strategies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Listeria monocytogenes as the main causative agent of human listeriosis is an intracellular bacterium that has the capability to infect a wide range of cell types. Human listeriosis is a sporadic foodborne disease, which is epidemiologically linked with consumption of contaminated food products. Listeriosis may range from mild and self-limiting diseases in healthy people to severe systemic infections in susceptible populations. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in food resources and human samples from Iran. METHODS: A systematic search was performed by using electronic databases from papers that were published by Iranian authors Since January of 2000 to the end of April 2017. Then, 47 publications which met our inclusion criteria were selected for data extraction and analysis by Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Software. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of L. monocytogenes in human origin was 10\% (95\% CI: 7-12\%) ranging from 0 to 28\%. The prevalence of L. monocytogenes in animals was estimated at 7\% (95\% CI: 4-10\%) ranging from 1 to 18\%. Moreover, the pooled prevalence of L. monocytogenes in Iranian food samples was estimated at 4\% (95\% CI: 3-5\%) ranging from 0 to 50\%. From those 12 studies which reported the distribution of L. monocytogenes serotypes, it was concluded that 4b, 1/2a, and 1/2b were the most prevalent serotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of L. monocytogenes and prevalent serotypes in Iran are comparable with other parts of the world. Although the overall prevalence of human cross-contamination origin was low, awareness about the source of contamination is very important because of the higher incidence of infections in susceptible groups.},

	abstract = {Examining the literature suggests equine personality is of interest to behavior and welfare scientists and those involved in the equine industry. Study and assessment of personality is critical because of the profound implications certain traits have with respect to injury risk, the horse-human relationship, training processes, learning in horses, and management or breeding practices. The review summarizes the evidence for a genetic basis of personality, the evidence for modification of personality by environment and experience, the measures and tools used in assessing personality, and the traits comprising personality. The review also highlights key considerations for the researcher and areas warranting further study. A literature search was conducted using Google Scholar and Web of Science with the search terms equine and horse in combination with personality and temperament. One hundred thirteen articles were included in the review after exclusion of non-peer-reviewed articles, abstracts, theses, and dissertations. Differences in personality between breeds, estimates of heritability, and identification of specific genes and genetic markers relating to personality illustrate the genetic basis of personality. Further work in identifying specific genes and genetic markers of other personality traits would enable more targeted breeding programs. Experience with their dam, environmental factors such as housing conditions, and training or handling modify a horse's expression of personality. These factors also present potential confounding variables for the researcher. The effects of the in vivo environment on personality in horses remains unexplored as does the importance of timing over the lifespan for modification and the duration of these effects. Personality is assessed via direct observation and measurement of behavioral, endocrine, cardiac response, or temperature correlates during structured tests or routine management procedures, questionnaires, or a combination thereof. Careful consideration should be given to selection of the most appropriate assessment method given the aims of the study, resources available, and previous validation of the method or methods. Reactivity, gregariousness, reactivity to humans, sensory sensitivity, and locomotor activity are some of the most assessed traits, but no unifying structure of personality is consistently identified across studies. Researchers should give attention to addressing and acknowledging potential confounding variables and selecting an appropriate trait to assess with validated measures.},

A literature search of PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus was carried out in November 2019 from which nine studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Despite the significant heterogeneity in the composition of the scaffolds used in each study, it could be concluded that scaffolds containing bioactive glass improve bone regeneration in these models, both by osteogenic and angiogenic measures. Incorporation of additional elements into the glass network, using additives, and using biochemical factors generally had a beneficial effect. Comparing the different compositions of non-cellular bioactive glass containing scaffolds is however difficult due to the heterogeneity in bioactive glass compositions, fabrication methods and biochemical additives used.},

The aim of this review was to systematically analyse the literature describing the effects of anaesthetic drugs and doxapram on laryngeal motion in dogs and to determine which drug regime provides the best conditions for laryngeal examination. PubMed, Google Scholar, and EMBASE databases were used for the literature search up to November 2019. Relevant search terms included laryngeal motion, anaesthetic drugs and dogs. Studies were scored based on their level of evidence (LoE), according to the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine, and the quality was assessed using the risk-of-bias tool and SIGN-checklist. In healthy dogs, premedication before laryngeal examination provided better examination conditions and maintained overall adequate laryngeal motion in 83\% of the studies. No difference in laryngeal motion between induction drugs was found in 73\% of the studies but the effects in dogs with laryngeal paralysis remain largely unknown. Doxapram increased laryngeal motion in healthy dogs without serious side effects, but intubation was necessary for some dogs with laryngeal paralysis. Methodological characteristics varied considerably between studies, including the technique and timing of evaluation, number of assessors, study design, drug dose, combinations, route and speed of administration.},

	abstract = {Parasites reside inside or outside their hosts and get host nutrition and blood. Here, we have emphasized economic losses in cattle caused by parasitic diseases due to ecto- and endo- parasites (flies, ticks, mites and helminths). We have outlined different methods/models including economic evaluation techniques and dynamic analysis as a major class, used for the calculation of economic losses caused by parasites in cattle. According to already conducted studies, a decrease in production is mentioned in quantity and percentage while financial losses are expressed in the form of account with respect to per head, herd or for the specific study area. The parasites cause the reduced production and financial losses due to control, treatment and mortality costs. We calculated the average decrease in milk production and organ condemnation as 1.16 L animal-1 day-1 and 12.95\%, respectively, from overall cattle parasitic infections. Moreover, the average calculated financial and percentage losses were US\$ 50.67 animal-1 year-1 and 17.94\%, respectively. Economically important parasitic diseases mentioned here are caused by specific spp. of protozoans and helminths according to data collected from the literature. Protozoan diseases include tick-borne diseases, coccidiosis, neosporosis, trypanosomiasis and cryptosporidiosis. Losses due to tick-borne infections were encountered for decreased milk production, mortality, treatment and control. Losses from coccidiosis were due to decreased weight gain, treatment costs and mortality. While abortion losses were encountered in neosporosis. Trypanosomiasis caused losses due to a decrease in milk yield. Moreover, only diagnostic (conventional or molecular techniques) cost was taken into account for cryptosporidiosis. Economically important nematode parasites are Oesophagostomum spp., Cooperia spp., Trichostrongylus spp., Strongyloides spp., Ostertagia spp. and Haemonchus placei. Due to the zoonotic importance of echinococcosis, Echinococcus granulosus is the most economically important cestode parasite. Losses caused by echinococcosis were due to organ condemnation, carcass weight loss and decreases hide value, milk production and fecundity. While, fascioliasis is one of the most economically important trematodal disease, which causes cirrhosis of the liver due to parasite migration, and thus, the organ becomes inedible. So, it would be helpful for farmers and researchers to approach these methods/models for calculation of parasitic losses and should adopt suitable measures to avoid long-term economic losses.},

	abstract = {The public health and economic burden of rabies has led to major intersectoral initiatives worldwide to reduce its burden. Over the last decade, the impact of rabies prevention and control programmes in real-world settings has become increasingly evident, especially in countries where most rabies exposures and deaths occur, but they have yet to successfully eradicate rabies due to limited access to health care services. We aimed to systematically review published transmission dynamic modelling studies of rabies in both humans and dogs with a focus on studies which estimated the epidemiological and economic impact of different preventive measures. The findings are intended to inform the World Health Organization's (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) to improve programmatic feasibility and clinical practice in rabies. Medline and Scopus were systematically searched for peer-reviewed articles which were published up to 14(th) June 2017. In addition, studies identified from a meeting of the WHO Expert Consultation on Rabies on 26-28(th) April 2017 in Bangkok, Thailand were added, resulting in 19 articles which were included in the review. Results from the disease modelling indicated that the basic reproduction number was low (less than 2 in all but one study). All studies found that rabies control through canine vaccination was likely to be effective in terms of reducing the incidence of rabies in dogs and/or humans, with most studies suggesting 70\% annual coverage was adequate. Vaccine coverage, dog density and birth rate were identified as crucial factors influencing the effectiveness of the interventions. In conclusion, the findings from this review suggest that rabies control through canine vaccination is likely to be effective in reducing the incidence of rabies. Vaccine coverage, dog density and canine birth rate were identified as critical factors influencing the effectiveness of vaccination interventions.},

We conducted a systematic review of preclinical and clinical studies addressing the effects of amantadine in animal models of depression and in patients with depression. METHODS: PubMed, Science Direct, and Web of Science were searched up to September 1, 2017 to identify clinical and preclinical studies. The following search terms were used: "amantadine AND depress*"; "amantadine AND mood"; "amantadine AND animal models AND antidepres*"; and "amantadine AND (forced swim, learned helplessness, reserpine, chronic mild stress, anhedonia, sucrose preference)." RESULTS: Amantadine had antidepressant-like effects in animal models and appeared to potentiate the antidepressant effects of other antidepressants. These preclinical findings have received some support from the results of small open-label clinical trials, suggesting that amantadine can reduce depressive symptomatology and potentiate the antidepressant effects of monoaminergic drugs. In addition to its glutamatergic and dopaminergic effects, the potential antidepressant-like effects of amantadine have been linked to molecular and cellular actions, such as increased expression of neurotrophic factors (e.g., brain-derived neurotrophic factor), activation of σ1 receptors, decreased corticosterone levels, and decreased inflammatory response to stress. CONCLUSION: Amantadine is an interesting candidate as new antidepressant drug for the treatment of depression.},

There were discrepancies between different data and little is known concerning associated risk factors of S. suis. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate on S. suis infection risk factors in human. We searched eight relevant databases using the MeSH terms "Streptococcus suis" OR "Streptococcus suis AND infection" limited in human with no time nor language restriction. Out of 4,999 articles identified, 32 and 3 studies were included for systematic review and meta-analysis respectively with a total of 1,454 Streptococcus suis cases reported. S. suis patients were generally adult males and the elderly. The mean age ranged between 37 to 63 years. Meningitis was the most common clinical manifestation, and deafness was the most common sequelae found among survivors followed by vestibular dysfunction. Infective endocarditis was also noted as among the most common clinical presentations associated with high mortality rate in a few studies. Meta-analyses categorized by type of control groups (community control, and non-S. suis sepsis) were done among 850 participants in 3 studies. The combined odd ratios for studies using community control groups and non-S. Suis sepsis as controls respectively were 4.63 (95\% CI 2.94-7.29) and 78.00 (95\% CI 10.38-585.87) for raw pork consumption, 4.01 (95\% CI 2.61-6.15) and 3.03 (95\% CI 1.61-5.68) for exposure to pigs or pork, 11.47, (95\% CI 5.68-23.14) and 3.07 (95\% CI 1.81-5.18) for pig-related occupation and 3.56 (95\% CI 2.18-5.80) and 5.84 (95\% CI 2.76-12.36) for male sex. The results were found to be significantly associated with S. suis infection and there was non-significant heterogeneity. History of skin injury and underlying diseases were noted only a small percentage in most studies. Setting up an effective screening protocol and public health interventions would be effective to enhance understanding about the disease.},

METHODS: In this meta-analysis, multiple databases and journals were searched through February 2016 to identify longitudinal studies using standardized tests of critical thinking [California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST), Health Science Reasoning Test (HSRT), and Defining Issues Test (DIT)] in any language. Two reviewers extracted information and collected information regarding primary author, publishing journal, health profession, critical thinking test, and time1/time2 means and standard deviations. Standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were reported using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Four hundred sixty-two studies were screened, and 79 studies (representing 6884 students) were included. Studies contained 37 CCTST, 22 DIT, and 20 HSRT. Health professions comprised nursing, pharmacy, physical therapy, occupational therapy, dentistry, medicine, veterinary medicine, dental hygiene, clinical laboratory sciences, and allied health. Cohen's kappa was strong (0.82) for inter-reviewer agreement.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence published on the treatment of idiopathic chylothorax (IC) in small animals. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review. SAMPLE POPULATION: Dogs and cats with IC. METHODS: A literature search was performed in three bibliographic databases in July 2018 for publications on IC in dogs and cats. Articles meeting criteria for inclusion were evaluated for treatment, survival, outcome data, and level of evidence (LoE) with a modified Oxford Level of Evidence (mOLE) and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) system. RESULTS: Eleven of 313 identified articles met the inclusion criteria. Only one study was identified in dogs as having higher LoE by using the mOLE system, whereas no study was identified as such in either species with the GRADE system. Surgery was the primary treatment in all dogs and in 93\% (68/73) of cats. Medical therapy was the primary treatment in 7\% (5/73) of cats. The most common surgical treatment combined thoracic duct ligation (TDL) and subtotal pericardiectomy (SP; 40\%; 34/84) in dogs and TDL in cats (51\% [37/73]). CONCLUSION: The body of literature for IC treatment in small animals was limited to one higher LoE study in dogs and none in cats. No strong conclusion could be drawn regarding the effectiveness of any one surgical method in dogs or cats, and no evidence was found to support medical therapy as a primary treatment. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The best available evidence regarding the treatment of IC is published in dogs and provides some support for surgical treatment with either TDL + cisterna chyli ablation or TDL + SP. Additional evidence is required to confirm this finding.},

As a result, it was observed that although OCPs have been banned for use in agriculture since the 1980s, these compounds or their metabolites have still been detected in many samples, and in some cases the levels were above the maximum allowed by the World Health Organization. In addition, most of the samples presented contamination, which makes them a great risk to human health due to their bioaccumulation.},

	abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a widespread disease that crosses the human and animal health boundaries, with infection being reported in wildlife, from temperate and subtropical to arctic regions. Often, TB in wild species is closely associated with disease occurrence in livestock but the TB burden in wildlife remains poorly quantified on a global level. Through meta-regression and systematic review, this study aimed to summarize global information on TB prevalence in commonly infected wildlife species and to draw a global picture of the scientific knowledge accumulated in wildlife TB. For these purposes, a literature search was conducted through the Web of Science and Google Scholar. The 223 articles retrieved, concerning a 39-year period, were submitted to bibliometric analysis and 54 publications regarding three wildlife hosts fulfilled the criteria for meta-regression. Using a random-effects model, the worldwide pooled TB prevalence in wild boar is higher than for any other species and estimated as 21.98\%, peaking in Spain (31.68\%), Italy (23.84\%) and Hungary (18.12\%). The pooled prevalence of TB in red deer is estimated at 13.71\%, with Austria (31.58\%), Portugal (27.75\%), New Zealand (19.26\%) and Spain (12.08\%) positioning on the top, while for European badger it was computed 11.75\%, peaking in the UK (16.43\%) and Ireland (22.87\%). Despite these hard numbers, a declining trend in wildlife TB prevalence is apparent over the last decades. The overall heterogeneity calculated by multivariable regression ranged from 28.61\% (wild boar) to 60.92\% (red deer), indicating that other unexplored moderators could explain disease burden. The systematic review shows that the most prolific countries contributing to knowledge related with wildlife TB are settled in Europe and Mycobacterium bovis is the most reported pathogen (89.5\%). This study provides insight into the global epidemiology of wildlife TB, ascertaining research gaps that need to be explored and informing how should surveillance be refined.},

	abstract = {Animal tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) bacteria remains as one of the most significant infectious diseases of livestock, despite decades of eradication programmes and research efforts, in an era where the livestock sector is among the most important and rapidly expanding commercial agricultural segments worldwide. This work provides a global overview of the spatial and temporal trends of reported scientific knowledge of TB in livestock, aiming to gain insights into research subtopics within the animal TB epidemiology domain and to highlight territorial inequalities regarding data reporting and research outputs over the years. To deliver such information, peer-reviewed reports of TB studies in livestock were retrieved from the Web of Science and Google Scholar, systematized and dissected. The validated data set contained 443 occurrence observations, covering the 1981-2020 period (39 years). We highlight a clear move towards transdisciplinary areas and the One Health approach, with a global temporal increase in publications combining livestock with wildlife and/or human components, which reflect the importance of non-prototypical hosts as key to understanding animal TB. It becomes evident that cattle is the main host across works from all continents; however, many regions remain poorly surveyed. TB research in livestock in low-/middle-income countries is markedly growing, reflecting changes in animal husbandry, but also mirroring the globalization era, with a marked increase in international collaboration and capacitation programmes for scientific and technological development. This review gives an overview of the most prolific continents, countries and research fields in animal TB epidemiology, clearly outlining knowledge gaps and key priority topics. The estimated growth trend of livestock production until 2050, particularly in Asia and Africa, in response to human population growth and animal-protein demand, will require further investment in early surveillance and adaptive research to accommodate the higher diversity of livestock species and MTC members and raising the possibility to fine-tune funding schemes.},

	abstract = {Evidence from recent animal studies suggest that minocycline, a broad-spectrum antibiotic capable of regulating immune processes, may possess antidepressant properties. These studies, however, have yet to be comprehensively reviewed. Accordingly, this systematic review and meta-analysis summarizes the extant literature examining the effect of minocycline on depressive-like behavior in rodent models. PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for articles that met prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria, and standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated for each continuous measure of depressive-like behavior. The overall effect of minocycline on depressive-like behavior was estimated using robust variance estimation meta-analysis. Separate subgroup analyses were conducted on diseased vs healthy animal models, different rodent species, and immobility-based vs anhedonia-based measures of depressive-like behavior. A total of 22 preclinical studies (816 animals) were included. Overall, minocycline reduced depressive-like behavior in rodents (SMD = -1.07, 95\% CI -1.41--0.74, p {\textless} 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed that minocycline reduced depressive-like behavior in diseased, but not healthy, animal models. Finally, minocycline was found to reduce both immobility-based and anhedonia-based outcomes. These findings suggest that minocycline may be an effective treatment of core depressive symptoms, and that further investigation of minocycline treatment for clinically relevant depression in humans is warranted.},

Plant and animal products have traditionally been used to relieve pain for centuries. However, no attempt has been made to compile a single report of plant and animal products possessing analgesic properties. This review enadeavours to recover data from published articles to establish a collective literature review on folk remedies from plant and animal sources used as analgesics and in the treatment of pain-related conditions, identifying gaps in existing knowledge and future works. Relevant information was systematically retrieved using the PRISMA method. In this review, in total, 209 plants were found to be either used raw or prepared by decoctions or maceration. Administration was either oral or topical, and they were predominantly used in Asian countries. In vivo studies of plants with analgesic properties, which were tested using different methods including acetic-induced writhing test, hotplate test, tail-flick test, and formalin-induced pain test, were compiled. Animal products with analgesic properties were obtained mainly from compounds present in venom; their bioactive compounds were also identified. In the literature search, certain gaps were noted, which could be reviewed in future studies. For instance, there was a disparity of information regarding the traditional uses of medicinal plants. In this review, an attempt was made to critically assess and describe the pharmacological properties and bioactive composition of indigenous plants, some animal species, and animal venom by scrutinizing databases and looking for published articles. Therefore, it can be concluded that the compounds obtained from these sources can serve as important ingredients in therapeutic agents to alleviate pain once their limitations are assessed and improved upon.

Currently there is no any accepted vaccine for prevention of T. gondii infection. Many studies are focused on using of various excretory secretory antigens (ESA); and among them dense granule antigens (GRAs) being involved in parasite survival, virulence and replication processes, are considered as one of the predominant vaccine candidates. The aim of this systematic review is to prepare more comprehensive understanding of these antigens to reduce T. gondii infection in humans and animals. English databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Scopus, ISI Web of Science were systematically searched and papers evaluating GRA antigens published until June 2019 were selected. Evaluation of selected publications revealed that GRA4 and GRA7 substantially increased survival time of the experimental animals. It is noticeable that the maximum reduction in cyst burden was observed in BALB/c mice vaccinated with combination of GRA3, GRA7 and M2AP antigens (93.5\%). GRA6 and GRA10 have shown high immunogenicity and GRA1 and 2 are important for virulence and induction of immune responses.

SETTING: Sina Trauma and Surgery Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. METHODS: We searched PubMed and EMBASE via Ovid SP with no temporal and linguistic restrictions. Besides, hand-search was performed in the bibliographies of relevant studies. The experimental non-interventional and non-transgenic animal studies confined to the rat species which assess the pathological change of microglia /macrophages at the specified time were included. RESULTS: We found 15,315 non-duplicate studies. Screening through title and abstract narrowed down to 607 relevant articles, 31 of them were selected based on the inclusion criteria. The reactivity of the microglia/macrophages initiates in early hours PI in contusion, compression and transection models. Cells activity reached a maximum within 48 h to 28 days in compression, 7 days in contusion and between 4 and 60 days in transection models. Inflammatory response occurred at the epicenter, in or near the lesion site in both gray and white matter in all three injury models with a maximum extension of one centimeter caudal and rostral to the epicenter in the gray matter in contusion and transection models. CONCLUSION: This study was designed to study spatial-temporal changes in the activation of microglia/macrophages overtime after TSCI. We were able to demonstrate time-dependent cell morphological changes after TSCI. The peak times of cell reactivity and the areas where the cells responded to the injury were determined.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Regular walking is a critical target of physical activity (PA) promotion, and dog walking is a feasible PA intervention for a large segment of the population. The purpose of this paper was to review PA interventions that have involved canine interactions and to evaluate their effectiveness. A secondary aim of this review was to highlight the populations, settings, designs and intervention components that have been applied so as to inform future research. DESIGN: Systematic review. DATA SOURCES: We carried out literature searches to August 2019 using six common databases. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies included published papers in peer-reviewed journals and grey literature (theses and dissertations) in the English language that included any PA behaviour change design (ie, randomised controlled trial, quasi-experimental) that focused on canine-related intervention. We grouped findings by population, setting, medium, research design and quality, theory and behaviour change techniques applied. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 25 010 publications which were reduced to 13 independent studies of medium and high risks of bias after screening for eligibility criteria. The approaches to intervene on PA were varied and included loaner dogs, new dog owners and the promotion of walking among established dog owners. Findings were consistent in showing that canine-assisted interventions do increase PA (82\% of the studies had changes favouring the canine-facilitated intervention). Exploratory subanalyses showed that specific study characteristics and methods may have moderated the effects. Compared with studies with longer follow-up periods, studies with shorter follow-up favoured behaviour changes of the canine intervention over the control condition. CONCLUSION: Canine-based PA interventions appear effective, but future research should move beyond feasibility and proof of concept studies to increase rigour, quality and generalisability of findings.},

	abstract = {Achieving high embryo quality following IVF and ICSI procedures is a key factor in increasing fertility outcomes in human infertile couples. While the male factor is known to underlie infertility in about 50\% of cases, studies performed in human infertile couples have not been able to define the precise effect of sperm affectations upon embryo development. This lack of consistency is, in most cases, due to the heterogeneity of the results caused by the multiple male and female factors that mask the concrete effect of a given sperm parameter. These biases can be reduced with the use of animal gametes, being a good approach for basic researchers to design more homogeneous studies analyzing the specific consequences of a certain affectation. Herein, we conducted a systematic review (March 2020) that assessed the relationship between sperm oxidative stress alterations and IVF/ICSI outcomes in nonhumans mammals. The review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines and using the MEDLINE-PubMed and EMBASE databases. Thirty articles were included: 11 performed IVF, 17 conducted ICSI, and two carried out both fertilization methods. Most articles were conducted in mouse (43\%), cattle (30\%) and pig models (10\%). After IVF treatments, 80\% of studies observed a negative effect of sperm oxidative stress on fertilization rates, and 100\% of studies observed a negative effect on blastocyst rates. After ICSI treatments, a positive relationship of sperm oxidative stress with fertilization rates (75\% of studies) and with blastocyst rates (83\% of studies) was found. In conclusion, the present systematic review shows that sperm oxidative stress is associated with a significant reduction in fertilization rates and in vitro embryo development.},

	abstract = {Collaborative approaches in health, such as One Health (OH), are promising; nevertheless, several authors point at persistent challenges for designing and implementing OH initiatives. Among other challenges, OH practitioners struggle in their efforts to collaborate across disciplines and domains. This paper aims to provide insights into the existing challenges for designing and implementing OH initiatives, their causes and solutions, and points out strategic solutions with the potential to solve practical challenges. A systematic literature search was performed for emerging challenges and proposed solutions in the process of conducting OH initiatives. Next, a thematic and a causal analysis were performed to unravel challenges and their causes. Finally, solutions were discriminated on whether they were only recommended, or implemented as a proof-of-principle. The 56 included papers describe 21 challenges endured by OH initiatives that relate to different themes (policy and funding; education and training; surveillance; multi-actor, multi-domain, and multi-level collaborations; and evidence). These challenges occur in three different phases: the acquisition of sufficient conditions to start an initiative, its execution, and its monitoring and evaluation. The findings indicate that individual challenges share overlapping causes and crosscutting causal relations. Accordingly, solutions for the successful performance of OH initiatives should be implemented to tackle simultaneously different types of challenges occurring in different phases. Still, promoting collaboration between the wide diversity of stakeholders, as a fundamental aspect in the OH approach, is still by far the most challenging factor in performing OH initiatives. Causes for that are the difficulties in promoting meaningful and equal participation from diverse actors. Solutions proposed for this challenge focused on guiding stakeholders to think and collaborate beyond their professional and cultural silos to generate knowledge co-creation and innovative methodologies and frameworks. Finally, the biggest knowledge gap identified, in terms of proposed solutions, was for monitoring and evaluating OH initiatives. This highlights the need for future research on evaluation methods and tools specific for the OH approach, to provide credible evidence on its added value. When considering challenges endured by former OH initiatives and the proposed solutions for these challenges, practitioners should be able to plan and structure such initiatives in a more successful way, through the strategic pre-consideration of solutions or simply by avoiding known barriers.},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives: Rickettsia rickettsii is a pathogen that is known to cause spotted fever, a zoonosis that is endemic in several regions of the Americas. However, no systematic review and meta-analysis has been conducted to estimate the prevalence of this rickettsial disease in the Americas. Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of R. rickettsii in ticks in the Americas. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed and data were retrieved from four electronic databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, SciELO, ScienceDirect, and Directory of Open Access Journals. The pooled prevalence and heterogeneity were determined using a random-effects model and using Cochran's Q test and I(2) index, respectively. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot and Egger's method. Results: The pooled prevalence of R. rickettsii in ticks was highest in Colombia (17.00\%; confidence interval [95\% CI]: 7.01-30.24), followed by Mexico (9.89\%; 95\% CI: 2.03-22.74), Panama (2.76\%; 95\% CI: 0.45-6.93), Brazil (2.03\%; 95\% CI: 0.66-4.14), and the United States (0.50\%; 95\% CI: 0.15-1.05). The tick species most frequently infected by R. rickettsii were Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (6.23\%; 95\% CI: 2.79-10.92) and Amblyomma mixtum (4.36\%; 95\% CI: 0.25-13.14). Interpretation and Conclusion: It can be suggested that studies aiming to identify the potential vectors of R. rickettsii should be conducted more intensively to better understand the epidemiology of spotted fever in the Americas.},

Searches for data on N. caninum seroprevalence and potential risk factors were conducted in the PubMed, LILACS, and SciElo databases. The random effects model was used for the meta-analysis of the included studies. The pooled prevalence of N. caninum in cattle was 24\% (95\% confidence interval (CI), 19-29) in North and Central America, 24\% (95\% CI, 20-28) in South America, 18\% (95\% CI, 14-21) in Asia, 15\% (95\% CI, 12-18) in Europe, 13\% (95\% CI, 11-16) in Africa, and 8\% (95\% CI, 4-14) in Oceania. A significant correlation was found between N. caninum infection and abortion in cows (odds ratio (OR) = 2.66, 95\% CI, 1.97-3.59). The following risk factors were signicantly associated with N. caninum seroprevalence: presence of dogs on the farm (OR = 2.84; 95\% CI, 1.40-5.80) and the type of cattle production system, with dairy cattle being more susceptible to bovine neosporosis (OR = 1.60; 95\% CI, 1.16-2.19) than beef cattle. The adoption of measures to prevent the dissemination of N. caninum in cattle herds is suggested, aiming to reduce the economic losses incurred to the dairy and beef industry.},

The objective of this study was to use meta-analytical methods to estimate the pooled prevalence of MRSA in chickens, turkeys, chicken meat, and turkey meat. Three electronic databases (PubMed, LILACS, and SciELO) were searched to establish MRSA prevalence from 51 studies published from 2003 through May 2017. The heterogeneity was assessed, and the pooled MRSA prevalence was calculated by using the random effects model according to the method of DerSimonian and Laird. Pooled MRSA prevalence (95\% confidence interval [CI]) in turkeys, turkey meat, broilers, and chicken meat was 36\% (1 to 78\%), 13\% (1 to 28\%), 5\% (2 to 9\%), and 5\% (3 to 8\%), respectively. South America had the highest MRSA prevalence (27\%; 95\% CI, 17 to 37\%), and North America had the lowest (1\%; 95\% CI, 0 to 2\%). Livestock-associated MRSA has been isolated from poultry and poultry meat, indicating that this variant can spread from farm to fork. The presence of MRSA in poultry and poultry meat poses risks to public health, and steps should be taken to mitigate the contamination and spread of this bacterium along the poultry production chain.},

	abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The Brazilian Cerrado is a biome with a remarkable diversity of plant species, many of which are used mainly by local communities as a source of treatment to several pathologic processes, especially for the treatment of wounds. However, no systematic review exists focusing on the plants used in this respect and on the appropriate pharmacological investigations that substantiate the actions that are reported. This study revisits the traditional use of medicinal plants from the Brazilian Cerrado in the treatment of wounds and the pharmacological characteristics of the reported plant species. METHOD: ology: For the present article, previous studies on plants of the Brazilian Cerrado used for wound healing carried out between 1996 and 2018 were researched on various academic databases (PubMed, Elsevier, Springer, Lilacs, Google Escolar, and Scielo). RESULTS: A total of 33 studies were carried out on 29 plant species distributed into 18 families, mainly Fabaceae or Leguminosae (9), Bignoniaceae (2), Asteraceae (2), Euphorbiaceae (2). Considering the great diversity of Cerrado plants, only a small number of wound healing studies were carried out between 1996 and 2018. It was observed that there is a large gap between experimentation assay and traditional use. There are only few connections between the form of use by the population and the experiments conducted in the laboratory. We found that only about 12\% of these studies considered to use the methodologies, or at least in parts, to obtain extracts such as those used in folk medicine. Approximately 37\% of the experiments were performed using the bark as well as the same ratio for leaves, 6\% using the fruits, and 9\% using the seeds, roots or flowers. In several studies, there are reports of chemical constituents such as flavonoids and tannins, followed by steroid terpenes, saponins, and fatty acids, and alkaloids. However, approximately 35\% of the studies did not supply information about compounds present in the preparation or the effect which could be attributed to these agents in respect to wound healing. Regarding treatment, most of the studies employed a topical treatment, though intraperitoneal and oral treatment were also described using either topical, oil-based formulations, but also gel- or saline-based formulations. CONCLUSIONS: Although, there has been an increase in knowledge about the biological actions of plants from Cerrado biome, the scientific basis for the traditional use of these local medicinal plants in wound healing does not provide sufficient information on the efficacy of the treatment, the molecular mechanisms, or, in particular, the effective doses used and the drug interactions. Thus, focused research investigating these hypotheses from traditional knowledge is necessary to prove the evidence of the potential pharmacological action.},

Dogs could develop infections that range from asymptomatic to severe, and shed leptospires with their urine. Given their close contact with humans, dogs may act both as epidemiological links or as sentinels of pathogenic leptospires in the environment. The aims of our study were to quantitatively summarize the overall prevalence of leptospiral antibodies and to identify factors associated with the probabilities of infection. We searched the electronic databases Scopus, PubMed, PMC and ScienceDirect for observational studies on canine leptospirosis published between 1989 and December 2019 and written in English, Spanish or Portuguese. We fitted a series of multilevel random effects meta-analysis models to estimate the prevalence of antibodies against Leptospira for different types of dogs, health statuses, diagnostic tests, geographic regions and income categories of the countries. We also fitted a number of random effects meta-analysis models to estimate the pooled odds-ratio of factors associated with canine leptospirosis. After removing duplicates and articles not meeting selection criteria, a total of 130 studies in 91 articles were included in this work. We found lower seroprevalence estimates in North America countries (P{\textless}0.001) and other high income countries (P{\textless}0.001). We also found higher probabilities of leptospiral infection in adult (P=0.017), male dogs with access to the streets (P{\textless}0.001). Identifying the profile of dogs that are more exposed to leptospirosis could be useful in the design of public health strategies for the prevention and control of leptospirosis.},

DATA SOURCES: PubMed database search (1966 to November 2017) using the search terms allergy, allergic rhinitis, asthma, allergic asthma, house dust mite, allergen immunotherapy, subcutaneous immunotherapy, sublingual immunotherapy, MK-8237, children, and pediatric. Package labeling and references from identified articles were also reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies published in English evaluating the efficacy of HDM SLIT in children {\textless}18 years of age were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Patients with allergic asthma who fail to improve with pharmacotherapy may require disease-modifying, HDM-specific immunotherapy. Acceptance of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) in the pediatric population is limited by the need for weekly injections and the risk of systemic adverse effects. Trials in pediatric patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma monosensitized to HDM demonstrated mixed results, likely because of variability in methodologies. SLIT reduced asthma symptoms in 8 placebo-controlled studies; however, asthma medication use was reduced in just 4 trials. Compared with pharmacotherapy alone, SLIT and SCIT decreased asthma symptom scores similarly for up to 3 years. Sequential SCIT/SLIT decreased both asthma symptoms and medication scores and was more effective than SLIT alone. CONCLUSIONS: Sublingual HDM immunotherapy reduces symptom scores in pediatric patients with allergic asthma but may be slower in onset and less effective than SCIT in reducing asthma medication use.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reports of natural infections of Schistosoma mansoni in a number of species of nonhuman primates (NHPs) in Africa, coupled with the substantial overlap of NHP habitats and human schistosomiasis endemic areas, has led to concerns about the role of NHPs in the transmission of human schistosomiasis. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to describe the current scope of knowledge for Africa, for the NHP species implicated, their geographical distribution, infection rates with S. mansoni, and to discuss the implications for public health and conservation. MAIN TEXT: A systematic search of the literature was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, the World Health Organization (WHO) library database, World Cat, and ScienceDirect without any language restriction. Studies examining S. mansoni infection of any African NHP species were included. Study types, primate species, their geographical distribution, and parasite diagnostic techniques reported in the studies were qualitatively summarized. Data for species with sample sizes ≥10 were included in the meta-analysis. We assessed the reported infection rate, and used a random-effects model to estimate the summary infection rates and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed heterogeneity among studies using the I(2) statistics. Twenty-nine publications, from 1960 to 2018, were identified and included in the review. The studies examined a total of 2962 primates belonging to 22 species in 11 genera across ten countries (Cameroon, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe), and S. mansoni infections were found in nine species of five genera in all countries. When we excluded studies with sample sizes {\textless} 10, data from 24 studies on 11 species of primates in three genera in ten countries remained in the meta-analysis. The overall pooled estimate of infection rate was 10\% (95\% CI: 6-16\%) with high heterogeneity (I(2) = 94.77\%) across countries and species/genera. Among the three genera, Pan had the highest infection rate of 15\% (95\% CI: 0-55\%), followed by Papio at 11\% (95\% CI: 6-18\%), and Cercopithecus at 5\% (95\% CI: 0-14\%). The association between NHP and human infections was positive, but not significant, due to low study sample matches and high variation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that S. mansoni infection rate is high in African NHPs, with substantial heterogeneities across species/genera and countries in Africa. Given the evidence for potential spillover and spillback of S. mansoni between African NHPs and humans, further research is urgently needed to understand ecology and mechanisms of transmission of the parasite between NHP and human hosts, in order to inform control strategies of this important neglected tropical disease.},

Cannabis has been legalized in several countries and jurisdictions recently. Experimental studies specifically targeting cannabinoids' effects on the cerebral vasculature are rare. There is evidence for transient vasoconstrictive effects of cannabinoids in the peripheral and cerebral vasculature in a complex interplay of vasodilation and vasoconstriction. Vasoreactivity to cannabinoids is dependent on the specific molecules, their metabolites and dose, baseline vascular tone, and vessel characteristics as well as experimental conditions and animal species. We systematically review the currently available literature of experimental results in in vivo and in vitro animal studies, examining cannabinoids' effects on circulation and reactive vasodilation or vasoconstriction, with a particular focus on the cerebral vascular bed.},

	abstract = {Stereotypies are repetitive behaviors the may be performed in effort to relieve frustration or cope with a sub-optimal environment. Cattle are hypothesized to cope with the differences between forage and grain-based diets with oral stereotypies that manifest as in the form of non-nutritive oral behaviors (NNOB). Diets fed in confinement contain less roughage compared to the predominantly forage diets cattle consume while on pasture. These changes in diet composition, presentation, and time required to consume elicit physiological changes in the rumen and require cattle to spend less time engaged in oral behaviors (e.g. mastication of the cud, using the tongue to grasp and pull on grass) - all factors that contribute to NNOB performance. Allogrooming and self-grooming are also classified as NNOBs, however, they have function and are not stereotypic in nature. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the current state of research regarding the relationship between diet and NNOB performance in cattle. Searches of CAB Abstracts, AGRIS, Scopus and SPAC, performed prior to September 2018 resulted in 22 articles (25 studies) that analyzed the impact of dietary treatments on NNOB performance in both beef and dairy cattle housed in confinement. Increasing dietary roughage levels decreased the performance of NNOBs while limiting dietary roughage increased NNOB performance. However, there was little conclusive evidence to suggest that ingredient type, particle size, total feed amount, mode of feeding, or mineral addition influenced NNOB performance. Strengths of the studies included consistent housing across treatments and valid and reliable methods of behavioral recording. Many studies did not consider weaning method in their animal selection and some studies did not randomize animals into each treatment, identifying an opportunity for improvement in this area of research. Risk of bias was performed using JBI Critical Assessment Tools and a very low risk of bias was found for both randomized and (non-random) quasi-experiment trials. This systematic review examined studies varying in sample size, cattle age/sex and experimental design, showcasing a small yet diverse research area.},

	abstract = {Physical exercise is considered a well-tolerated adjuvant therapy to mitigate cancer-related side effects, but its impact on metastasis is unclear. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize the evidence on the effects of exercise on metastasis in animal cancer models. A systematic search was conducted to identify controlled studies in animals analyzing the impact of exercise interventions on any marker of metastasis incidence or severity. The pooled mean differences (PMD) were calculated for those endpoints for which a minimum of three studies used the same assessment method. We also calculated the pooled odds ratio (OR) of metastases. Twenty-six articles were included in the systematic review, of which 12 could be meta-analyzed. Exercise training in murine cancer models did not significantly modify the number of metastatic foci (PMD = - 3.18; 95\% confidence interval [CI] - 8.32, 1.97; p = 0.23), the weight of metastatic tumors (PMD = - 0.03; 95\% CI - 0.10, 0.04; p = 0.41), or the risk of developing metastasis (OR = 0.64; 95\% CI 0.10, 4.12; p = 0.64). These findings suggest that exercise has no overall influence on any marker of cancer metastasis incidence or severity in animal models. However, the wide methodological heterogeneity observed between studies might be taken into account and the potential exercise effects on metastasis development remain to be determined in pediatric tumors.},

It is recognized as safe by food safety authorities, but in recent years, governments and scientists have raised concerns about its genotoxicity. This systematic review aims to assess the potential associations between food TiO(2) exposure and microbiota composition and functions. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed up to December 2020 in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. The PRISMA guidelines followed. The risk of bias was assessed from ARRIVE and SYRCLE tools. RESULTS: A total of 18 animal studies were included (n = 10 mice, n = 5 rats, n = 2 fruit flies, n = 1 silkworm). Studies varied significantly in protocols and outcomes assessment. TiO(2) exposure might cause variations in abundance in specific bacterial species and lead to gut dysfunctions such as a reduction in SCFAs levels, goblet cells and crypts, mucus production, and increased biomarkers of intestinal inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Although the extrapolation of these results from animals to humans remains difficult, this review highlights the key role of gut microbiota in gut nanotoxicology and stimulates discussions on the safe TiO(2) use in food and dietary supplements.

	abstract = {Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is a promising neuroprotective therapy for ischemic stroke. Preclinical studies investigating RIC have shown RIC reduced infarct volume, but clinical trials have been equivocal. Therefore, the efficacy of RIC in reducing infarct volume and quality of current literature needs to be evaluated to identify knowledge gaps to support future clinical trials. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of preclinical literature involving RIC in rodent models of focal ischemia. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019145441). Eligibility criteria included rat or mice models of focal ischemia that received RIC to a limb either before, during, or after stroke. MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched from 1946 to August 2019. Risk of bias was assessed using the SYRCLE risk of bias tool along with construct validity. Seventy-two studies were included in the systematic review. RIC was shown to reduce infarct volume (SMD - 2.19; CI - 2.48 to - 1.91) when compared to stroke-only controls and no adverse events were reported with regard to RIC. Remote ischemic conditioning was shown to be most efficacious in males (SMD - 2.26; CI - 2.58 to - 1.94) and when delivered poststroke (SMD - 1.34; CI - 1.95 to - 0.73). A high risk of bias was present; thus, measures of efficacy may be exaggerated. A limitation is the poor methodological reporting of many studies, resulting in unclear construct validity. We identified several important, but under investigated topics including the efficacy of RIC in different stroke models, varied infarct sizes and location, and potential sex differences.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The therapeutic effects of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) may extend past thrombosis prevention, with preclinical evidence demonstrating anti-metastatic properties. Clinical evidence on the topic, however, remains controversial. A systematic review of preclinical evidence may help elucidate reasons for this contradictory evidence. The objective of our systematic review is to assess the anti-metastatic properties of LMWHs in solid tumour animal models. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science and PubMed were searched from inception to May 12th, 2020. All articles were screened independently and in duplicate. Studies that compared LMWH to a placebo or no treatment arm in solid tumour animal models were included. The primary outcome was the burden of metastasis. Secondary outcomes included primary tumour growth and mortality. The risk of bias was assessed in duplicate using a modified Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. RESULTS: Forty-two studies were included in the review. Administration of a LMWH was associated with a significant decrease in the burden of metastasis (SMD -2.18; 95\% CI -2.66 to -1.70). Additionally, the administration of a LMWH was also associated with a significant reduction in primary tumour growth (SMD -1.95; 95\% CI -2.56 to -1.34) and risk of death (RR 0.39; 95\% CI 0.16-0.97). All included studies were deemed to be at an unclear risk of bias for at least one methodological criterion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that LMWH can effectively reduce metastatic burden and reduce tumour growth in preclinical animal models of solid tumour malignancies. Reasons for the contradiction with clinical evidence require further exploration.},

	abstract = {Migratory animals are widely assumed to play an important role in the long-distance dispersal of parasites, and are frequently implicated in the global spread of zoonotic pathogens such as avian influenzas in birds and Ebola viruses in bats. However, infection imposes physiological and behavioural constraints on hosts that may act to curtail parasite dispersal via changes to migratory timing ("migratory separation") and survival ("migratory culling"). There remains little consensus regarding the frequency and extent to which migratory separation and migratory culling may operate, despite a growing recognition of the importance of these mechanisms in regulating transmission dynamics in migratory animals. We quantitatively reviewed 85 observations extracted from 41 studies to examine how both infection status and infection intensity are related to changes in body stores, refuelling rates, movement capacity, phenology and survival in migratory hosts across taxa. Overall, host infection status was weakly associated with reduced body stores, delayed migration and lower survival, and more strongly associated with reduced movement. Infection intensity was not associated with changes to host body stores, but was associated with moderate negative effects on movement, phenology and survival. In conclusion, we found evidence for negative effects of infection on host phenology and survival, but the effects were relatively small. This may have implications for the extent to which migratory separation and migratory culling act to limit parasite dispersal in migratory systems. We propose a number of recommendations for future research that will further advance our understanding of how migratory separation and migratory culling may shape host-parasite dynamics along migratory routes globally.},

The analysis was conducted using the LILACS, PubMed, Scopus and Argentina SciELO databases employing as keywords 'Giardia' AND 'Argentina'. We also carried out a manual review of papers. Of 304 articles, 92 fitted the eligibility criteria. Giardia was reported in 15 of the 23 Argentine provinces; human prevalence was between 3.4 and 64.8\%. Indigenous children and residents in peri-urban areas had the higher infection rates. In animals, Giardia was identified mainly in dogs with a prevalence of 8.9 ± 7.0\%, and studies of wild animals and cattle were notably scarce. Environmental studies showed that Giardia was detected in the soil and water which may act as reservoirs for this parasite revealing the need to modify the national water treatment legislation. The identification of Giardia genetic assemblages in the studies analysed was limited and showed that genotypes AII and B were found in humans while assemblage B was mainly detected in animals. This report provides useful information on epidemiological aspects of giardiasis in Argentina that may help to define future research priorities and provides useful tools for professionals regarding actual information on the prevalence of this infection.},

	abstract = {Paratuberculosis is an incurable infectious disease that affects several species, including goat (Capra hircus). The etiologic agent is Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) that has tropism for the intestine, causing anorexia, progressive weight loss and death. In goats, the main transmission route is the ingestion of water and food contaminated by infected feces. Affected animals also eliminate the agent through milk, with a potential biological risk to public health. Thus, the aim of this study was to conduct a research of the literature available in electronic media for a systematic review, followed by a meta-analysis of the results found on prevalence and diagnostic tests adopted in the detection of MAP antibodies and DNA in goat milk. The following search parameters were used: "Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis" AND (goat OR small ruminant) AND (milk OR pasteurized milk). Strictly obeying pre-established criteria, 437 articles were selected from the respective electronic databases of scientific content: ScienceDirect (285), PubMed (68), Web of Science (60) and Scopus (24), of which nine papers were elected to the construction of the systematic review and meta-analysis. The prevalence of MAP antibodies in milk detected by milk-ELISA ranged from 1.1 to 67.7\% and the prevalence of MAP DNA in goat milk detected by MAP-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ranged from 1.94 to 37.74\%. A meta-analysis indicated a combined MAP infection prevalence of 8.24\%, but with high heterogeneity among study findings (I$^{\textrm{2}}$ = 98.7\%). The identification of the MAP in goat milk implies the need for surveillance of the agent in order to prevent economic losses and impact on public health.},

	abstract = {Preventative healthcare consultations account for a large proportion of the veterinary caseload. This novel study is the first to methodically review all literature on canine and feline preventative healthcare consultations. Previous research has found these consultations to be different from health problem consultations in terms of communication style and content. Identifying relevant evidence and previously validated methods of measuring the success of these consultations will be useful when implementing strategies for optimisation. The aim of this study was to identify and assess the quality of existing literature which describes and/or measures the success of preventative healthcare consultations. Database searches of CAB Abstracts and Medline were conducted to identify published literature. Google searches were then conducted to identify any additional published or grey literature. Results were systematically screened to determine whether the returned sources were about cats and/or dogs, whether they related to preventative healthcare, and whether they described and/or measured the success of preventative healthcare consultations. For primary research citations which only described preventative healthcare consultations, data were extracted on the aspects of the consultations described. For citations which additionally measured the success of the consultations, the measures used, sampling technique, key results and key weaknesses were also extracted. Of 17,538 citations identified in total during the database searches, a total of seven relevant primary research citations were identified. All of these citations described aspects of the preventative healthcare consultation, such as consultation length, health problems discussed, actions taken and communication style. Only one primary research citation measured success of the consultation, using veterinarian satisfaction to determine success. In addition, 30 narrative citations, including expert opinion pieces, textbooks, guidelines without transparent methodology and conference presentations were identified. Google searches identified 224 relevant narrative citations, and five of the seven primary research citations identified by the database searches, but did not identify any additional relevant primary research citations. The results suggest that, despite accounting for around a third of all consultations, there is relatively little evidence describing preventative healthcare consultations and only one measure of success has been described for these consultations. This presents potential challenges when implementing strategies to optimise these consultations, as measures which are useful and relevant to veterinary practice should first be identified. Identifying useful measures of success will allow future strategies designed to maximise the benefits of these consultations to be meaningfully assessed for efficacy.},

	abstract = {Across the literature, there is large variation in lamb birth weight responses to changes in the ewe pregnancy nutrition. Much of this heterogeneity has been attributed to several factors inherent to each experiment; however, the relative contribution of these experimental factors has not yet been quantified. This meta-analysis aimed to systematically review the variation in lamb birth weight responses across nutritional studies involving adult multiparous ewes. Effect-sizes for individual studies were estimated using the unbiased estimator Hedges' g, whereby positive and negative values indicate heavier and lighter treatment lambs vs. controls, respectively. Heterogeneity varied between early-, mid- and late-pregnancy undernutrition studies (I2total [early pregnancy] = 19.90\%, I2total [midpregnancy] = 52.10\%, I2total [late pregnancy] = 68.70\%). The small average effects for early- (0.04, highest posterior density [HPD] interval = -0.22, 0.28) and mid-pregnancy undernutrition (-0.15, HPD interval = -0.35, 0.05) suggest that if farmers anticipate a potential feed shortage, ewes can be allowed to lose weight providing nutrition is resumed to adequate levels later in pregnancy. On the contrary, late-pregnancy undernutrition was associated with a significant decrease in lamb birth weight (-0.72, HPD interval = -0.86, -0.55). Thus, management practices should focus on ensuring adequate nutrition in late pregnancy. Increasing lamb birth weight could be possible by feeding ewes above their pregnancy maintenance requirement (0.23, HPD interval = 0.002, 0.48), though the number of studies is limited and further research is needed.},

We searched PubMed and Web of Science for publications that assessed the effects of handling, maternal separation (MS), and limited bedding and nesting (LBN) on performance in the Morris water maze (MWM), novel object recognition (NOR), and contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Forty-five studies met inclusion criteria (n = 451-763 rodents per test) and were used to calculate standardized mean differences (Hedge's g) and to assess heterogeneity, publication bias, and the moderating effects of sex and species (rats vs. mice). We found significantly lower heterogeneity in LBN compared to handling and MS with no consistent effects of sex or species across the three paradigms. LBN and MS caused similar cognitive deficits in tasks that rely heavily on the dorsal hippocampus, such as MWM and NOR, and were significantly different compared to the improved performance seen in rodents exposed to handling. In the CFC task, which relies more on the ventral hippocampus, all three paradigms showed reduced freezing with moderate effect sizes that were not statistically different. These findings demonstrate the utility of using meta-analysis to quantify outcomes in a large number of inconsistent preclinical studies and highlight the need to further investigate the possibility that handling causes different alterations in the dorsal hippocampus but similar outcomes in the ventral hippocampus when compared to MS and LBN.},

	abstract = {This meta-analysis of 39 experiments containing 118 treatments explored the effects of diet interventions in early lactation on the proportion of dairy cows pregnant to artificial insemination (AI; pregnancy to AI) and on calving to pregnancy interval. It also identified factors that may explain variation in these responses. The objectives were to identify effects of diet on reproduction, rather than differences between specific dietary interventions. The examination of calving to pregnancy interval used the more traditional method of analyzing differences between a treatment and the reference treatment used for comparison within a given experiment. The systematic review identified fewer experiments (n = 39) than had been expected. Four different multivariable models including the random effect of experiment were used to examine the effects of CPM-Dairy (version 3.08) estimated diet and production variables on proportion pregnant to AI. These models examined (1) output of products, (2) balance or duodenal availability of nutrients, (3) intake of nutrients, or (4) percentage of nutrients in the diet. The multivariable models identified positive associations between estimated increased fatty acid intake [incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.0003 ± 0.0001g/d; ±standard error], starch intake (IRR = 1.061 ± 0.029 kg/d), metabolizable energy balance (IRR = 1.004 ± 0.002 MJ/d), and duodenal C14:0 (IRR = 1.008 ± 0.004 g/d) availability with the proportion of cows pregnant to AI, whereas rapidly fermentable sugar intake (IRR = 0.813 ± 0.054 kg/d), percentage of sugar in the diet (IRR = 0.960 ± 0.015\%), and milk protein yield (IRR 0.922 ± 0.022 g/100 g per day) were associated with a reduced proportion of cows pregnant to AI. There was no multivariable model developed to assess variables associated with calving to pregnancy interval but, univariably, increased metabolizable energy balance was associated with a shorter calving to pregnancy interval whereas increased milk production was associated with longer time to pregnancy. Increased intake of some AA, particularly threonine and lysine, were associated with a longer calving to pregnancy interval. It is clear nutritional management around calving can influence reproductive success. The importance of dietary fats and increased energy and protein balances in early lactation for improved fertility outcomes is supported and suggests that starch and sugars may have different effects on the proportion of cows that are pregnant to AI. This work also highlighted a need for further focused field studies exploring the roles of specific fatty acids, AA, phosphorus, and carbohydrates on reproduction.},

Improved diagnosis and prognosis of brain injury may be possible by examining changes in protein biomarker concentrations and, determining their role in long-term outcomes may improve treatment. One promising direction for biomarker research surrounds pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines which may have utility for predicting short and long-term prognosis after TBI, and may also be therapeutic targets in shaping neuronal recovery following a TBI. The purpose of this review is to examine the relationship between TBI symptoms and changes in pro- and anti- inflammatory biomarkers. Eighteen (18) published articles met criteria for inclusion. Fourteen studies focused on individuals with severe TBI. Increased levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, IL-8, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) were associated with worse outcomes, with most studies focusing on morbidity and mortality. It is important to identify the biochemical changes that may influence or initiate the presentation of health outcomes after a TBI. Earlier identification of symptoms associated with these biochemical changes can be used to support better treatment planning, targeted interventions and ultimately, improvement in patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {Beyond the functional tasks that assistance dogs are trained for, there is growing literature describing their benefits on the psychosocial health and wellbeing of their handlers. However, this research is not only widely disparate but, despite its growth, has not been reviewed since 2012. Our objective was to identify, summarize, and methodologically evaluate studies quantifying the psychosocial effects of assistance dogs for individuals with physical disabilities. Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review was conducted across seven electronic databases. Records were independently screened by two authors. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they assessed outcomes from guide, hearing, medical, or mobility service dogs, if they collected original data on handlers' psychosocial functioning, and if the outcome was measured quantitatively with a validated, standardized measure. Studies on psychiatric service dogs, emotional support dogs, and pet dogs were excluded. Of 1,830 records screened, 24 articles were identified (12 publications, 12 theses) containing 27 studies (15 cross-sectional, 12 longitudinal). Studies assessed the effects of mobility (18), hearing (7), guide (4), and medical (2) assistance dog partnerships with an average sample size of N = 83. An analysis of 147 statistical comparisons across the domains of psychological health, quality of life, social health, and vitality found that 68\% of comparisons were null, 30\% were positive in the hypothesized direction, and 2\% were negative. Positive outcomes included significant effects of having an assistance dog on psychological wellbeing, emotional functioning, self-esteem, and vitality. However, it is of note that several methodological weaknesses of the studies make it difficult to draw any definitive conclusions, including inadequate reporting and a failure to account for moderating or confounding variables. Future research will benefit from stronger methodological rigor and reporting to account for heterogeneity in both humans and assistance dogs as well as continued high-quality replication.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The heterogeneity of Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates among triatomines insects and animal reservoirs has been studied in independent studies, but little information has been systematised to allow pooled and comparative estimates. Unravelling the main patterns of this heterogeneity could contribute to a further understanding of T. cruzi transmission in Colombia. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Medline, LILACS, Embase, Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar and secondary sources with no filters of language or time and until April 2018. Based on selection criteria, all relevant studies reporting T. cruzi infection rates in reservoirs or triatomines were chosen. For pooled analyses, a random effects model for binomial distribution was used. Heterogeneity among studies is reported as I(2). Subgroup analyses included: taxonomic classification, ecotope and diagnostic methods. Publication bias and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: Overall, 39 studies reporting infection rates in Colombia were found (22 for potential reservoirs and 28 for triatomine insects) for a total sample of 22,838 potential animals and 11,307 triatomines evaluated for T. cruzi infection. We have found evidence of 38/71 different animal species as potential T. cruzi reservoirs and 14/18 species as triatomine vectors for T. cruzi. Among animals, the species with the highest pooled prevalence were opossum (Didelphis marsupialis) with 48.0\% (95\% CI: 26-71\%; I(2) = 88\%, τ(2) = 0.07, P {\textless} 0.01) and domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) with 22.0\% (95\% CI: 4-48\%; I(2) = 96\%, τ(2) = 0.01, P {\textless} 0.01). Among triatomines, the highest prevalence was found for Triatoma maculata in the peridomestic ecotope (68.0\%, 95\% CI: 62-74\%; I(2) = 0\%, τ(2) = 0, P {\textless} 0.0001), followed by Rhodnius prolixus (62.0\%, 95\% CI: 38-84\%; I(2) = 95\%, τ(2) = 0.05, P {\textless} 0.01) and Rhodnius pallescens (54.0\%, 95\% CI: 37-71\%; I(2) = 86\%, τ(2) = 0.035, P {\textless} 0.01) in the sylvatic ecotope. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic and quantitative analyses of triatomine insects and potential animal reservoirs for T. cruzi infection in Colombia. The results highlight a marked heterogeneity between species and provide initial estimates of infection rates heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The history of medical application of propolis (also known as bee glue) dates back to the times of ancient Greeks, Romans, Persians and Egyptians. Honey and other bee products, including propolis, occupy an important place in Polish folk medicine. Scientific research on propolis in Poland began in the early 1960s in Zabrze and continues until now. AIM OF THE REVIEW: The aim of this review is to provide an overview of information on Polish research on propolis and its medical application with particular emphasis on studies concerning wound healing. Consequently, our goal is also to shed a new light on therapeutic potential of Polish propolis in order to support future research in the field. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of scientific literature on propolis and its medical application was performed by using the literature databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar). We paid special attention to papers describing the effect of propolis on skin wound healing as well as to Polish contribution to research on propolis. RESULTS: Professor Stan Scheller was the first Polish scientist dealing with propolis and its medical potential. His legacy was continued by several research teams that studied the topic in various aspects. They analyzed propolis composition, its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antiapoptotic and anticancer properties as well as its application in dentistry and wound treatment. Burn wound healing physiology after propolis administration was thoroughly studied on pig model, whereas research on patients proved the efficacy of propolis in chronic venous leg ulcer treatment. CONCLUSION: Polish scientists have made a significant contribution to the research on propolis, its biological properties and influence on wound healing. Propolis ointments can effectively accelerate the healing process and improve healing physiology, so they can be recommended as a promising topical medication for wound treatment in the future clinical and preclinical trials.},

Studies on anthelmintic bioactivity of plant species provide new alternatives to face problems such as gastrointestinal parasitism, resistance to synthetic chemical products, environmental impact, and residual activity inproducts of animal origin. To know the chemical profile of plants in the tropical dry forest (TDF) of Tolima with anthelmintic activity in sheep, a systematic study based on the document "The Tropical Dry Forest in Colombia", which includes 2569 plant species among native, naturalized, and exotic plants from Tolima, was conducted. By using the SCOPUS database, the academic Google search engine, and Microsoft Office 2010 Excel, each species was designated with the same criterion to identify those with anthelmintic activity and qualitative phytochemical content; then, the groups with the highest analysis were identified, and the species with simultaneous analysis were selected from the 3 chemical groups with the highest frequency, and the weight gain AND sheep search criteria was applied to the resulting group. 45 native, 6 naturalized, and 20 exotic species with anthelmintic activity were found. The Fabaceae (13 species), Amaranthaceae (4 species), Annonaceae, Apocynaceae, Euphorbiaceae, and Malvaceae (3 species each) families stand out. The three chemical groups with the high LEVELS OF PHYTOCHEMICALS were tannins, flavonoids, and alkaloids, and at a medium level saponins, steroids, and terpenoids. Simultaneous content of tannins, flavonoids and alkaloids was found in 19 native, 3 naturalized, and 12 exotic species, 5 of which present scientific report of use in sheep feed.},

	abstract = {High values of ambient temperature and relative humidity negatively affect livestock because they induce heat stress. In heat-stressed ewes, the reproduction is affected, although there apparently is a different effect depending on their physiological status. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analyses to estimate the effect of heat stress on the reproductive performance and physiology of cycling or pregnant ewes. We included studies in which pregnant or cycling ewes were exposed to heat stress and included a comparison group. We assessed the risk of bias and used meta-analyses that included the period of exposure to calculate pooled estimates. We included 36 studies comprising 20,626 ewes, and the meta-analyses demonstrated that heat stress decreased 7.09 h (95\% CI, - 10.75, - 3.43) the duration of estrus in cycling ewes but increased 0.57 days (95\% CI, 0.23, 0.92) the length of the cycle, although differentially affecting the expression of sexual behavior. Heat-stressed cycling ewes had greater odds of embryo mortality (OR = 12.36; 95\% CI, 7.10, 21.54) and a decreased chance of impregnation (OR = 0.41; 95\% CI, 0.23, 0.75). In heat-stressed pregnant ewes, placental and fetal weights were reduced, respectively in 183.62 g (95\%CI, - 252.25, - 114.99) and 1665.18 g (95\% CI, - 2136.82, - 1193.55). Heat stress increased ewes' body temperature 1.13 °C (95\% CI, 0.85, 1.42) and respiratory rate 93.53 breaths/min (95\% CI, 63.5, 123.5) without affecting heart rate. In a sub-group analyses, the period of exposure was shown to cause a significant effect. In conclusion, our results revealed a differential effect of heat stress that depends on both the physiological status of ewes and the period of exposure, and identify susceptible reproductive stages during which the severe effects of heat stress can be prevented/ameliorated.},

	doi = {10.1111/brv.12329},
	abstract = {Early survival is highly variable and strongly influences observed population growth rates in most vertebrate populations. One of the major potential drivers of survival variation among juveniles is body mass. Heavy juveniles are better fed and have greater body reserves, and are thus assumed to survive better than light individuals. In spite of this, some studies have failed to detect an influence of body mass on offspring survival, questioning whether offspring body mass does indeed consistently influence juvenile survival, or whether this occurs in particular species/environments. Furthermore, the causes for variation in offspring mass are poorly understood, although maternal mass has often been reported to play a crucial role. To understand why offspring differ in body mass, and how this influences juvenile survival, we performed phylogenetically corrected meta-analyses of both the relationship between offspring body mass and offspring survival in birds and mammals and the relationship between maternal mass and offspring mass in mammals. We found strong support for an overall positive effect of offspring body mass on survival, with a more pronounced influence in mammals than in birds. An increase of one standard deviation of body mass increased the odds of offspring survival by 71\% in mammals and by 44\% in birds. A cost of being too fat in birds in terms of flight performance might explain why body mass is a less reliable predictor of offspring survival in birds. We then looked for moderators explaining the among-study differences reported in the intensity of this relationship. Surprisingly, sex did not influence the intensity of the offspring mass-survival relationship and phylogeny only accounted for a small proportion of observed variation in the intensity of that relationship. Among the potential factors that might affect the relationship between mass and survival in juveniles, only environmental conditions was influential in mammals. Offspring survival was most strongly influenced by body mass in captive populations and wild populations in the absence of predation. We also found support for the expected positive effect of maternal mass on offspring mass in mammals (r(pearson)  = 0.387). As body mass is a strong predictor of early survival, we expected heavier mothers to allocate more to their offspring, leading them to be heavier and so to have a higher survival. However, none of the potential factors we tested for variation in the maternal mass-offspring mass relationship had a detectable influence. Further studies should focus on linking these two relationships to determine whether a strong effect of offspring size on early survival is associated with a high correlation coefficient between maternal mass and offspring mass.},

	abstract = {Wound healing is a perfectly coordinated cascade of cellular, molecular, and biochemical events which interact in tissue reconstitution. Chronic diseases such as pressure ulcers (PU) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are considered risk factors for wound healing. Patients with such diseases often have higher sepsis, infection, and complication rates, since they have revascularization inhibition and low growth factor expression. Thus, latex biomembrane (LBM), a biocompatible material, derived from the latex of the rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) appears to create tendencies as an angiogenic-inducing tissue healing agent and as biomaterial, resulting from its structural qualities and its low cost when compared to conventional treatments. Therefore, this work aims at summarizing the results, experiments, and scientific findings that certify or recommend the use of LBM as a new technique to be applied effectively in the treatment of wounds. An integrative review was held in the BIREME, LILACS, Burns, MEDLINE, PubMed, and SciELO databases, from 2000 to 2016, using the following descriptors: "healing," "diabetes mellitus," "wounds," and "latex membrane." As a result, 600 experiments (out of 612) presented satisfactory results; however, 33\% of the cases received explicit recommendations, 11\% required more studies on the subjects, and 1\% was denied. On the other hand, half of the studies did not expressly endorse its use, despite presenting satisfactory results. The LBM was characterized as a good therapeutic alternative in cases of wounds, including chronic diseases, such as diabetes mellitus and PU, due to its relevant potential for wound healing stimulation, acceleration of cell tissue mending and revascularization, or the reestablishment of angiogenic functions (creation of new blood vessels). The LBM was also confirmed to be safe as a biocompatible material whose structural qualities (elasticity, adaptability, impermeability, and possibility of suture), devoid of toxicity, allowed interaction between tissues and presented no hypersensitivity inducer and no antimicrobial effect.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cisplatin is one the most frequently used chemotherapeutic drugs for several decades. Although its antineoplastic effect has been reported in treatment of numerous malignances, various adverse effects seem to be the crucial limiting factor for its administration. OBJECTIVE: Beside the most commonly described nephro- and hepatotoxicity, cisplatin therapy is also accompanied with gastrointestinal, reproductive, hematological, cardiovascular and neurological side effects. Since it has been reported that cisplatin induce oxidative damage in various tissues, it seems reasonable to investigate an antioxidant supplementation as potential therapeutical approach for attenuation of cisplatin toxicities. METHODS: We performed a structured search of bibliographic databases for research literature using a focused review question and inclusion/exclusion criteria. The quality of retrieved papers (101 in total) was appraised using standard tools. RESULTS: Numerous antioxidants (such as thiol compounds, polyphenols, vitamins, etc.) had been reported for their beneficial effects on cisplatin-induced cardiotoxicity. The effects of various antioxidants, including sulfur-containing amino acids, have also been explored for mitigation of cisplatin neurotoxicity. However, the results for antioxidant supplementation in reduction of cisplatin-induced toxicities are still to be applied in clinical trials. CONCLUSION: Considering the facts that sulfur-containing amino acids: (a) do not interfere with chemotherapeutics antitumor action; (b) do not exhibit any toxic effect (unless applied in dose several times above the recommended); and (c) produce significant protective effects on some cisplatin-induced toxicities connected to augmentation of oxidative damage - it seems that their administration can be harmless and protective supplementation against numerous adverse effects of certain antineoplastic agents.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Taenia saginata taeniosis/cysticercosis has been well studied in several countries. Brazil is one of the most important beef exporting countries and has one of the highest cattle population size in the world. In this country, bovine cysticercosis (BCC) remains the most frequent reported zoonosis detected during post-mortem inspection, resulting in costs for the beef sector and public health. We performed a systematic literature review regarding data about BCC epidemiology in Brazil and meta-analyses for its prevalence in different administrative regions and the distribution over time, and based on this discussed possible control strategies. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to obtain data about BCC in Brazil using the words "bovine cysticercosis" and "Brazil" to construct the search phrase. The inclusion criteria used to select articles were: (i) published from 2000 to 2018; (ii) full text available online in Portuguese or English; and (iii) contain information at least regarding one of the following aspects of BCC in Brazil: prevalence, incidence, spatial distribution, risk-factors, economic burden and measures for control. RESULTS: A set of 42 articles was included, covering the prevalence of BCC in Brazil, ranging between 0.01-18.75\%. Prevalence results of 40 articles were included in a meta-analysis per administrative region. The highest prevalence was found in the South (3.4\%; 95\% CI: 2.0-5.2\%), followed by the Southeast (2.7\%; 95\% CI: 1.9-3.6\%), Northeast (1.5\%; 95\% CI: 0.6-2.7\%), Central-western (0.9\%; 95\% CI: 0.3-1.7\%) and North (0.0\%; 95\% CI: 0.0-0.6\%) region. In addition, a reduction in prevalence over time was observed in all the evaluated states except for Alagoas and Pará. CONCLUSIONS: Besides the large availability of data, a critical lack of information about BCC epidemiology remains in Brazil. Nevertheless, the available data on prevalence, high risk-areas and risk factors should contribute to a better understanding of transmission and the formulation of recommendations for control. A One Health approach will be required to reduce T. saginata taeniosis/cysticercosis prevalence and the consequent economic burden for the beef sector in Brazil, one of the most important beef exporters in the world.},

	abstract = {The objective of this meta-analysis was to summarize available information on the prevalence of thermotolerant Campylobacter (TC) in different food-producing animals worldwide. Databases (i.e., PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus) were searched from 1980 to 2017 unrestricted by language. The inclusion criteria were as follows: prevalence or incidence studies, published in peer-reviewed journals, and they must have reported the total number of animal samples studied and the number of samples that were positive for the presence of TC. When the identification of Campylobacter species was available, this information was included in the analysis. Multilevel random-effect meta-analysis models were fitted to estimate mean occurrence rate of TC and to compare them among different factors potentially associated with the outcome. The mean occurrence rate of TC in food-producing animals was 0.424 (95\% CI: 0.394-0.455), and the mean occurrence rate of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were 0.214 and 0.133, respectively. Pigs and poultry showed the highest prevalence of TC; however, there were differences in the prevalence of each Campylobacter species. Campylobacter jejuni was observed in broilers (0.322; 95\% CI: 0.273-0.377) and hens (0.395; 95\% CI: 0.265-0.542), while C. coli was restricted essentially in pigs (0.553; 95\% CI: 0.541-0.650). The prevalence of C. jejuni in intensively bred cattle was higher (0.302; 95\% CI: 0.227-0.389) than the prevalence in extensively bred cattle (0.172; 95\% CI: 0.119-0.242) while the prevalence of C. coli was similar (0.051; 95\% CI: 0.028-0.091 vs. 0.050; 95\% CI: 0.027-0.091) in both production systems. Agar with or without blood used for the isolation of TC did not affect the prevalence observed. The method of species identification did not seem to generate differences in the prevalence of Campylobacter species. The prevalence of Campylobacter in primary food production has a strong impact on the entire agri-food chain. National authorities must monitor the situation with the aim to establish the appropriate risk management measures.},

The application of biomaterials has emerged in bone reconstructive surgery, especially the use of bovine bone due to its biocompatibility. Due to the many benefits related to the use of PBMT and bovine bones, the aim of this research was to review the literature to verify the relationship between PBMT and the application of bovine bone in bone reconstruction surgeries. We chose the PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases for the search by matching the keywords: "Bovine bone AND low-level laser therapy", "Bovine bone AND photobiomodulation therapy", "Xenograft AND low-level laser therapy", and "Xenograft AND photobiomodulation therapy". The initial search of the three databases retrieved 240 articles, 18 of which met all inclusion criteria. In the studies concerning animals (17 in total), there was evidence of PBMT assisting in biomaterial-related conduction, formation of new bone, bone healing, immunomarker expression, increasing collagen fibers, and local inflammation reduction. However, the results disagreed with regard to the resorption of biomaterial particles. The only human study showed that PBMT with bovine bone was effective for periodontal regeneration. It was concluded that PBMT assists the process in bone reconstruction when associated with bovine bone, despite divergences between applied protocols.},

	abstract = {Trichinellosis, caused by the parasitic nematode Trichinella spp. is a widespread foodborne zoonotic disease and is a public health concern in many countries. Wild boar is the second most important source of trichinellosis for humans. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the global seroprevalence of Trichinella infection among wild boar. We searched five major databases for studies reporting Trichinella spp. seroprevalence in wild boar between January 1995 and January 2018. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled seroprevalence of Trichinella in wild boar. A total of 21 studies involving 16,327 wild boar from 15 countries were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled seroprevalence for Trichinella infection in wild boar was 6\% (95\% CI: 3-10\%; 1084/16327). The estimated seroprevalence in North America was 9\% (95\% CI, 1-25\%), in Europe 7\% (95\% CI, 3-13\%), in Asia 3\% (95\% CI, 0.0-11\%) and in Oceania 3\% (95\% CI, 2-4\%). Geographical location, gender and age were not significantly associated with seropositivity. In sub-group analysis, the pooled seroprevalence of Trichinella infection in wild boar when ELISA was used as the diagnostic test (16\%; 95\% CI, 4-34\%) was significantly higher when compared to western blot (4\%; 95\% CI, 0-12\%). These results emphasize that wild boars are a potential source for acquisition of Trichinella infection in humans, and surveillance programs should be implemented in high-risk countries.},

	abstract = {Dogs serve as the most important definitive hosts for Toxocara canis-a causative agent of human toxocariasis and one of the most widespread zoonotic helminth worldwide. The present study was undertaken to assess the global prevalence of T. canis infection in dogs. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE and SciELO were searched to identify relevant studies. A random-effects model was used to estimate the overall and the subgroup-pooled prevalences across studies, and heterogeneity was assessed via the I(2) test. The data were categorized according to WHO-region, different types of dogs, risk factors and environmental variables. From a total of 4370 peer-reviewed publications, 229 articles that studied 13,010,004 dogs in 60 countries met the final inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of Toxocara infection in dogs was 11.1\% (95\% CI, 10.6-11.7\%). The estimated prevalence in the different WHO-regions ranged from 6.4\% to 19.2\%: Eastern Mediterranean (19.2\%, 13.7-25.5\%), Africa (18.5\%, 13.7-23.9\%), South-East Asia (11.9\%, 6.8-18.2\%), North America (11.1\%, 10.6-11.7\%), South America (10.9\%, 7.6-14.6\%), Europe (10.8\%, 8.9-12.9\%) and Western Pacific (6.4\%, 3.3-10.2\%). Young ({\textless}1 year of age), stray, rural and male dogs had a significantly (P{\textless}0.001) higher prevalence of infection than older, pet, urban or female dogs. The prevalence was higher in low income countries and regions at a low geographical latitude, close to the equator, characterized as having tropical climates. From this review, it is estimated that ≥100 million dogs are infected with Toxocara around the world. This highlights the need for an increased focus on implementing affordable, appropriate control programs to reduce the public health threat of toxocariasis as a zoonosis of global importance.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human toxocariasis is an important neglected disease. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis study to estimate the global and regional prevalence of anti-Toxocara serum antibodies (referred to as 'T-seroprevalence') in human populations around the world. METHODS: We searched five international databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, SciELO and Scopus) for seroprevalence studies published from 1 January 1980 to 15 March 2019. We used random effect models to calculate the overall T-seroprevalence (with 95\% CIs) in all six WHO regions and worldwide. We also conducted subgroup and linear meta-regression analyses to evaluate the impact of socio-demographic, geographical and climatic parameters on seroprevalence. RESULTS: We identified 250 eligible studies (253 datasets) comprising 265,327 participants in 71 countries for inclusion in the present meta-analysis. The estimated global T-seroprevalence rate was 19.0\% (95\%CI, 16.6-21.4\%; 62,927/265,327); seroprevalence was highest in the African region (37.7\%; 25.7-50.6\%) and lowest in the Eastern Mediterranean region (8.2\%; 5.1-12.0\%). The pooled seroprevalence for other WHO regions was 34.1\% (20.2-49.4\%) in the South-East Asia; 24.2\% (16.0-33.5\%) in the Western Pacific; 22.8\% (19.7-26.0\%) in the American; and 10.5\% (8.5-12.8\%) in the European regions. A significantly higher T-seroprevalence was associated with a lower income level; lower human development index (HDI); lower latitude; higher humidity; higher temperature; and higher precipitation (P-value {\textless} 0.001). Potential risk factors associated with seropositivity to Toxocara included male gender; living in a rural area; young age; close contact with dogs, cats or soil; consumption of raw meat; and the drinking of untreated water. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings indicate high levels of infection with, or exposure to Toxocara spp. in many countries, which calls for increased attention to human toxocariasis and improved measures to prevent adverse health risks of this disease.},

Justification for, and the design and implementation of prevention and control of human toxocariasis may benefit from an understanding of the zoonotic potential and prevalence of parasites in this definitive host species. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies, conducted to estimate the prevalence of Toxocara infection(s) in cats by geographical location, type (rural vs urban and stray vs pet), gender and age. Pooled data were assessed using a random effects-model as well as several meta-regression and stratified analyses conducted. Of 1733 peer-reviewed articles, 143 were included in this review and represented 2,158,069 cats from 51 countries. The global pooled (95\% CI) prevalence of Toxocara infection in cats was 17.0\% (16.1-17.8\%), being highest in African (43.3\%, 28.3-58.4\%) and lowest in South American (12.6\%, 8.2-17.0\%) countries. In other WHO regions, prevalence rates of Toxocara were as follows: Eastern Mediterranean (21.6\%, 15.1-28.1\%), North America (18.3\%, 15.4-21.2\%), Europe (17.8\%, 15.9-19.7\%), Western Pacific (17.3\%, 14.7-19.9\%), and South-East Asia (14.9\%, 9.8-20.1\%). Prevalence of Toxocara was higher in low-income tropical countries and also in stray (28.6\%, 25.1-32.1\%) and young (≤12 months of age) (27.7\%, 23.4-32.0\%) cats than in pet (11.6\%, 10.7-12.5\%) and older cats ({\textgreater}12 months of age) (23.8\%, 14.8-32.7\%). This review indicates that {\textasciitilde}118-150 million cats worldwide serve as definitive hosts of Toxocara, shedding eggs and thus contributing to the public health risk of human infection. Prevention and control of this zoonosis in cats should receive greater attention by health officials and cat owners, particularly in countries where risk factors and prevalence are highest.},

In this systematic review, summarize the galactose (GAL) induced POI in rat and mice models. METHODS: For this systematic review, we conducted a search of case control studies published from 1990 until August 2018 in PubMed/Medline, and Web of science, using the descriptors in the title/abstract field. A 'pearl growing' strategy was employed whereby, after obtaining the full text articles, reference lists of all included studies (n = 14) were reviewed for additional publications that could be used. RESULTS: We selected and categorized 14 studies according to the time of exposure to GAL into two groups of prenatal (n = 4) and postnatal (n = 10). Findings of these studies showed that the different stages of follicular development are targeted differently by galactose exposure during the prenatal and postnatal periods: The small follicles (primordial and primary follicles) are targeted by galactose toxicity during prenatal exposure and the pre-antral and antral follicles are targeted by galactose toxicity during postnatal exposure. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review shows that galactose has an ovotoxicity effect that can be used to induce appropriate POI animal models only if sufficient doses, proper onset time, and duration of prenatal exposure are taken into account. An optimized model of POI induction should manifest all the required ovarian morphological, hormonal, and estrus cycle changes.},

	abstract = {Leishmania infantum is the main cause of human visceral leishmaniasis (HVL; also known as kala-azar) in the Middle East and may be fatal if left untreated. This disease was ﬁrst reported in 1949 in Iran. Despite marked improvements in hygiene and sanitation conditions, the disease is still endemic in some parts of Iran. It is difficult to determine the current prevalence of HVL in Iran due to the scarcity of comprehensive studies in this regard. In response to this gap, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to gain better understanding of HVL epidemiology in the general population of Iran. English and Persian databases were searched for studies reporting the prevalence and risk factors associated with HVL in the Iranian people from January 1995 to December 2019. The reported data were selected according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The pooled prevalence of HVL infection and its 95 \% confidence intervals were calculated. Quality assessment, heterogeneity testing and publication bias assessment were also done. Literature search revealed 3634 studies, of which 35 studies met our eligibility criteria, with a total of 50,716 individuals. The meta-analysis was performed on 31 out of 35 included studies. The estimated pooled prevalence of HVL infection according to seropositivity was 2\% (95 \% CI: 1-2\%) in the general population of Iran in which western and northern provinces had the lowest and the highest prevalence, 0.5 \% (95 \%CI, 0.2-0.7\%) and 3\% (95 \%CI, 1-5 \%), respectively. The seroprevalence of HVL among females (2\%; 95 \%CI, 1-2 \%) was more than males (1\%; 95 \%CI, 1-2 \%). The ≤10 and {\textgreater}10 years age groups had similar seroprevalence rates (1\%, 95 \%CI, 1-2 \% versus 1\%, 95 \%CI, 0-1 \%, respectively). There was no signiﬁcant difference in terms of geographic area, age and sex. Of 31 studies included in the meta-analysis, the most common diagnostic test was the direct agglutination test (96.77 \%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst systematic review of the prevalence of HVL in Iran. The results showed a low seroprevalence of HVL infection. However, the lack of published reports of HVL in an area does not exclusively mean the absence of the disease or carrier. We therefore recommend further studies in this regard.},

Epizootics of sylvatic plague through transmission in vectors (fleas) commonly completely extirpate colonies of prairie dogs. Wildlife managers employ a wide variety of insecticidal treatments to suppress plague and conserve prairie dog colonies. I compiled and statistically compared the available literature describing methods of plague control and their relative effectiveness in managing plague outbreaks by using meta-analyses. Natural log response ratios were used to calculate insecticide-induced vector mortality and vaccine-conferred survival increases in prairie dogs in 37 publications. Further, subgroupings were used to explore the most effective of the available vector suppression insecticides and plague suppression vaccines. After accounting for the type of treatment used and the method by which it was applied, I observed plague reduction through use of both insecticides and vaccines. Insecticides resulted in a significant reduction of the abundance of vectors by 91.34\% compared to non-treated hosts (p{\textless}0.0001). Vaccines improved survival of prairie dog hosts by 4.00\% (p{\textless}0.0001) compared to control populations. The use of insecticides such as deltamethrin and carbaryl is recommended to stop actively spreading epizootics, and dual antigen oral vaccines to initially suppress outbreaks.},

The aims of this systematic literature review are to provide an overview of the current state of PLF in poultry farming and investigate whether the focus of PLF research has been to improve bird welfare. The study characteristics extracted from 264 peer-reviewed publications and conference proceedings suggest that poultry PLF has received increasing attention on a global scale, but is yet to become a widespread commercial reality. PLF development has most commonly focussed on broiler farming, followed by laying hens, and mainly involves the use of sensors (environmental and wearable) and cameras. More publications had animal health and welfare than production as either one of or the only goal, suggesting that PLF development so far has focussed on improving animal health and welfare. Future work should prioritise improving the rate of commercialisation of PLF systems, so that their potential to improve bird welfare might be realised.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sarcoptic mange, caused by the Sarcoptes scabiei mite, is an infectious disease of wildlife, domestic animals and humans with international importance. Whilst a variety of treatment and control methods have been investigated in wildlife, the literature is fragmented and lacking consensus. The primary objectives of this review were to synthesise the diverse literature published on the treatment of sarcoptic mange in wildlife from around the world, and to identify the qualities of successful treatment strategies in both captive and free-roaming wildlife. METHODS: A systematic search of the electronic databases CAB Direct, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE and Discovery was undertaken. Data pertaining to study design, country, year, species, study size, mange severity, treatment protocol and outcomes were extracted from eligible studies and placed in a table. Following data extraction, a decision tree was used to identify studies suitable for further analysis based on the effectiveness of their treatment protocol, whether they were conducted on captive or non-captive wildlife, and the quality of their post-treatment monitoring period. RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies met our initial inclusion criteria for data collection. Of these studies, 15 were selected for further analysis following application of the decision tree. This comprised of 9 studies on captive wildlife, 5 studies on free-living wildlife and 1 study involving both captive and free-living wildlife. Ivermectin delivered multiple times via subcutaneous injection at a dose between 200-400 µg/kg was found to be the most common and successfully used treatment, although long-term data on post-release survival and re-infection rates was elusive. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this review is the first to demonstrate that multiple therapeutic protocols exist for the treatment of sarcoptic mange in wildlife. However, several contemporary treatment options are yet to be formally reported in wildlife, such as the use of isoxazoline chemicals as a one-off treatment. There is also a strong indication for more randomised controlled trials, as well as improved methods of post-treatment monitoring. Advancing this field of knowledge is expected to aid veterinarians, wildlife workers and policy makers with the design and implementation of effective treatment and management strategies for the conservation of wildlife affected by sarcoptic mange.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites that can infect nearly all invertebrates and vertebrates, posing a threat to public health and causing large economic losses to animal industries such as those of honeybees, silkworms and shrimp. However, the global epidemiology of these pathogens is far from illuminated. METHODS: Publications on microsporidian infections were obtained from PubMed, Science Direct and Web of Science and filtered according to the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Infection data about pathogens, hosts, geography and sampling dates were manually retrieved from the publications and screened for high quality. Prevalence rates and risk factors for different pathogens and hosts were analyzed by conducting a meta-analysis. The geographic distribution and seasonal prevalence of microsporidian infections were drawn and summarized according to sampling locations and date, respectively. RESULTS: Altogether, 287 out of 4129 publications up to 31 January 2020 were obtained and met the requirements, from which 385 epidemiological data records were retrieved and effective. The overall prevalence rates in humans, pigs, dogs, cats, cattle, sheep, nonhuman primates and fowl were 10.2\% [2429/30,354; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 9.2-11.2\%], 39.3\% (2709/5105; 95\% CI 28.5-50.1\%), 8.8\% (228/2890; 95\% CI 5.1-10.1\%), 8.1\% (112/1226; 95\% CI 5.5-10.8\%), 16.6\% (2216/12,175; 95\% CI 13.5-19.8\%), 24.9\% (1142/5967; 95\% CI 18.6-31.1\%), 18.5\% (1388/7009; 95\% CI 13.1-23.8\%) and 7.8\% (725/9243; 95\% CI 6.4-9.2\%), respectively. The higher prevalence in pigs suggests that routine detection of microsporidia in animals should be given more attention, considering their potential roles in zoonotic disease. The highest rate was detected in water, 58.5\% (869/1351; 95\% CI 41.6-75.5\%), indicating that water is an important source of infections. Univariate regression analysis showed that CD4+ T cell counts and the living environment are significant risk factors for humans and nonhuman primates, respectively. Geographically, microsporidia have been widely found in 92 countries, among which Northern Europe and South Africa have the highest prevalence. In terms of seasonality, the most prevalent taxa, Enterocytozoon bieneusi and Encephalitozoon, display different prevalence trends, but no significant difference between seasons was observed. In addition to having a high prevalence, microsporidia are extremely divergent because 728 genotypes have been identified in 7 species. Although less investigated, microsporidia coinfections are more common with human immunodeficiency virus and Cryptosporidium than with other pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the largest-scale meta-analysis to date on microsporidia prevalence in mammals, birds and water worldwide. The results suggest that microsporidia are highly divergent, widespread and prevalent in some animals and water and should be further investigated to better understand their epidemic features.},

	abstract = {Obesity is associated with the production of inflammatory cytokines that are implicated in insulin resistance (IR), and if not addressed, can lead to type 2 diabetes (T2D). The role of the immune system in skeletal muscle (SM) inflammation and insulin sensitivity is not yet well characterized. As SM IR is an important determinant of glycaemia, it is critical that the muscle-immune phenotype is mapped to help design interventions to target T2D. This systematic review synthesized the evidence for SM macrophage content and phenotype in humans and murine models of obesity, and the association of muscle macrophage content and phenotype with IR. Results were synthesized narratively, as we were unable to conduct a meta-analysis. We included 28 studies (n=10 human, n=18 murine), and all studies detected macrophage markers in SM. Macrophage content was positively associated with IR. In humans and mice, there was variability in muscle macrophage content and phenotype in obesity. Overall certainty in the evidence was low due to heterogeneity in detection methods and incompleteness of data reporting. Macrophages are detected in human and murine SM in obesity and a positive association between macrophage content and IR is noted; however, the standardization of markers, detection methods, and reporting of study details is warranted to accurately characterize macrophages and improve the potential for creating specific and targeted immune-based therapies in obesity.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assesses what is known and identify knowledge gaps for Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission patterns. METHODS: Meta-review searching the databases BioSys; Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialised Register and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; EMBASE; Google Scholar; LILACS; MEDLINE (PubMed); Web of Science; and WHOLIS with the term 'ZIKA'. Systematic reviews and reviews specifying the search methods and describing potential modes of transmission were eligible for analysis. RESULTS: Of 5,401 hits for 'Zika', 44 studies were assessed and 11 included after applying in- and exclusion criteria: six systematic reviews and five reviews with specified methods, covering all ways of possible transmission. Results can be grouped into transmission routes with good evidence and agreement between the studies (evidence on vector, mother-to-child and sexual transmission) and transmission routes with limited evidence. Transmission by breastfeeding, intrapartum, by animal bites or laboratory-based remains inconclusive, as these routes are suggested by single studies only. The risk of transfusion transmission is described and public health measures for safe transfusion should be taken as available. CONCLUSION: Our results imply the need for public health measures to limit transmission via vectors, mother-to-child, sexual transmission and blood transfusion. Also needed are long-term prospective cohort studies covering periods of active Zika virus transmission and measuring epidemiological parameters to establish evidence on other routes of transmission; seroprevalence studies; transmission dynamics modelling and modelling health impacts by different modes of transmission.},

	abstract = {Bluetongue (BT) is an infectious viral disease which affects a wide range of ruminants and was first reported in India in 1964. In view of the absence of comprehensive information on the BT status in India, this study presents the seroprevalence on BT in farm animals of India based-on a systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic review was conducted to identify the published articles (2001-2018) reporting the seroprevalence of BT in sheep, goats, cattle, buffalo, camels, and Mithun (Bos frontalis) from India. From 409 research articles, 71 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and meta-analysis for proportions was carried out targeting the eligible studies. From these, 144 strata level data were extracted with a sample size of 14048 sheep, 14696 goats, 5218 cattle, 2653 buffaloes, 2062 camels, and 222 Mithun. Overall, the analyses showed that the BT seroprevalence of 43\% (95\% CI: 38-49\%) in goats, 39\% (95\% CI: 33-46\%) in sheep, 38\% (95\% CI: 25-45\%) in cattle, 34\% (95\% CI: 20-51\%) in buffaloes, 16\% (95\% CI: 10-22\%) in camels, and 66\% (95\% CI: 17-95\%) in Mithun. Furthermore, the meta-regression analysis suggested that serological tests, geographical region, and sample size were the prime moderators. Meta-analytic study indicates the BT seropositivity in 25.35 million sheep (95\% CI: 21.5-29.9), 58 million goats (95\% CI: 51.3-66.2), 66.8 million cattle (95\% CI: 47.7-86), 37.0 million buffaloes (95\% CI: 21.7-55.4), 0.06 million camels (95\% CI: 0.04-0.09), and 0.19 million Mithun (95\% CI: 0.05-0.28). The findings highlight the variation of BT seropositivity in different geographical regions of India.},

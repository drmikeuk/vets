	abstract = {The Commission requested that EFSA review relevant new scientific references on electrical stunning of poultry and to recommend, if necessary, new electrical requirements applicable for waterbath stunning equipment. A systematic literature review was conducted to determine those electrical parameters that would deliver an effective stun so that birds would be rendered unconscious and insensible until death. Inspection data from slaughterhouse inspections conducted both in Member States in and non-Member States were included. Many of the published studies did not allow a comprehensive analysis due to different study designs and incomplete data. There are few observational studies in abattoirs to determine the numbers of birds that are effectively stunned, however, the inspection data from the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) did not identify major problems but, for practical reasons, they used non-EEG (electro-encephalogram) methods to ascertain the effectiveness of a stun. At the present time, an EEG is the most reliable indicator of unconsciousness and insensibility. Clinical somatosensory indicators are not as reliable. The aim of a stunning system is to achieve a 100\% effective stun, and the most effective electrical parameters in use can achieve an effectiveness of up to 96\% as measured using EEG ascertainment methods (100\% were reported as unconscious using non-EEG methods). It is recommended that the Regulation should indicate minimum current for each bird, frequency and current type as well as the wave characteristics – duty cycle and waveform. There should be better surveillance and monitoring of the electrical parameters in use at abattoirs and, in addition, methods that allow the accurate measurement of actual electrical current flowing through each bird should be further developed. Research on effective stunning should be validated by the measurement of EEG activity and related to clinical measures that are easier to use in practice.},

	abstract = {Many studies have assessed the impact of different pollutants on amphibians across a variety of experimental venues (laboratory, mesocosm, and enclosure conditions). Past reviews, using vote-counting methods, have described pollution as one of the major threats faced by amphibians. However, vote-counting methods lack strong statistical power, do not permit one to determine the magnitudes of effects, and do not compare responses among predefined groups. To address these challenges, we conducted a meta-analysis of experimental studies that measured the effects of different chemical pollutants (nitrogenous and phosphorous compounds, pesticides, road deicers, heavy metals, and other wastewater contaminants) at environmentally relevant concentrations on amphibian survival, mass, time to hatching, time to metamorphosis, and frequency of abnormalities. The overall effect size of pollutant exposure was a medium decrease in amphibian survival and mass and a large increase in abnormality frequency. This translates to a 14.3\% decrease in survival, a 7.5\% decrease in mass, and a 535\% increase in abnormality frequency across all studies. In contrast, we found no overall effect of pollutants on time to hatching and time to metamorphosis. We also found that effect sizes differed among experimental venues and among types of pollutants, but we only detected weak differences among amphibian families. These results suggest that variation in sensitivity to contaminants is generally independent of phylogeny. Some publication bias (i.e., selective reporting) was detected, but only for mass and the interaction effect size among stressors. We conclude that the overall impact of pollution on amphibians is moderately to largely negative. This implies that pollutants at environmentally relevant concentrations pose an important threat to amphibians and may play a role in their present global decline.},

	abstract = {Systematic review (SR) and meta-analyses (MA) methodologies were used to identify, critically evaluate and synthesize prevalence and concentration estimates for Escherichia coli O157 contamination along the beef production chain, and to illustrate differences based on cattle types and seasonality in North America from the scientific peer-reviewed literature. Four electronic databases were searched to identify relevant articles. Two independent reviewers performed all SR steps. Random effects MA models were used to estimate the pooled prevalence and concentration of E. coli O157 in feces, hides and carcasses of cattle processed in North America, including their seasonal estimates. The potential sources of between studies heterogeneity were identified using meta-regression and sub-group analysis. Results indicated differences in the fecal prevalence of E. coli O157 among cattle types: 10.68\% (95\% CI: 9.17-12.28\%) in fed beef, 4.65\% (95\% CI: 3.37-6.10\%) in adult beef, and 1.79\% (95\% CI: 1.20-2.48\%) in adult dairy. Fed beef fecal prevalence was 10.65\% (95\% CI: 8.93-12.49\%) during summer and 9.17\% (95\% CI: 5.24-13.98\%) during the winter months. For adult beef, the fecal prevalence was 7.86\% (95\% CI: 5.43-10.66\%) during summer, and 4.21\% (95\% CI: 1.95-7.13\%) during winter. Among adult dairy, the fecal prevalence was 2.27\% (95\% CI: 1.5-3.18\%) during summer, and 0.36\% (95\% CI: 0.09-0.74\%) during winter. There was a significantly higher percentage of hides with E. coli O157 concentration {\textgreater}/= 40 CFU/100 cm(2) on hides of fed beef sampled at the processing plant (23.81\%; 95\% CI: 14.79-34.15\%) compared to those sampled at the feedlot (1.74\%; 95\% CI: 0.53-3.44\%). Prevalence of E. coli O157 on carcass surfaces differed by season only at the post-evisceration stage, but decreased considerably through the subsequent processing stages. Country, study setting, detection method, hide swab area, and study design were identified as significant sources of heterogeneity among studies reporting prevalence of E. coli O157 along the beef production chain. The pooled prevalence and concentration estimates from this study provide a sound and reliable microbiological basis for risk assessment modeling of E. coli O157 and other pathogens in the food chain.},

	abstract = {Although a causal link between Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) and Crohn's disease has not been proved, previous studies suggest that the potential routes of human exposure to MAP should be investigated. We conducted a systematic review of literature concerning the likelihood of contamination of food products with MAP and the likely changes in the quantity of MAP in dairy and meat products along their respective production chains. Relevant data were extracted from 65 research papers and synthesized qualitatively. Although estimates of the prevalence of Johne's disease are scarce, particularly for non-dairy herds, the available data suggest that the likelihood of contamination of raw milk with MAP in most studied regions is substantial. The presence of MAP in raw and pasteurized milk has been the subject of several studies which show that pasteurized milk is not always MAP-free and that the effectiveness of pasteurization in inactivating MAP depends on the initial concentration of the agent in raw milk. The most recent studies indicated that beef can be contaminated with MAP via dissemination of the pathogen in the tissues of infected animals. Currently available data suggests that the likelihood of dairy and meat products being contaminated with MAP on retail sale should not be ignored.},

This review, which assesses the weight of available evidence, outlines the physiology of the vomiting reflex, causes of emesis, the consequences of emesis and the approach to clinical management of the vomiting dog. The applicability of diagnostic testing modalities and the merit of traditional approaches to management, such as dietary changes, are discussed. The role and usefulness of both traditional and novel anti-emetic drugs is examined, including in specific circumstances such as following cytotoxic drug treatment. The review also examines areas in which common clinical practice is not necessarily supported by objective evidence and, as such, highlights questions worthy of further clinical research.},

	abstract = {A quantitative assessment of dairy cow responses to contact current (stray voltage) at 50 or 60 Hz was conducted using meta-analysis and pooled analysis methodology. The objective was to more accurately quantify the minimum exposure level (threshold) at which dairy cows respond and to identify sources of heterogeneity among studies. Several medical and agricultural databases were used to locate individual studies for the systematic literature review, from which 22 published studies of stray voltage and behavioral response or milk yield met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis models were constructed to assess the percentage of cows with a behavioral response at documented exposure levels, and the summary relative risk estimate for all exposure pathways combined was calculated for each 1-mA increment from 1.0 through 5.0 mA. The meta-analysis of percentage response showed that cows exhibited statistically significant first behavioral responses at 3.0 mA, response probability increased with exposure levels, and exposure pathways contributed to heterogeneity in the model. The pooled analysis of mean behavioral response threshold was based on experimental studies of ascending series of current exposures on 355 cows. The overall weighted mean for first behavioral response to current was 4.0 mA. Ten of the studies that met the inclusion criteria addressed milk production, but heterogeneity in exposure pathways, patterns, and duration precluded meta-analysis or data pooling. The milk production studies ranged in size from 4 to 48 cows and used switchback or paired design to increase power. A qualitative narrative review of these studies indicated that production was not affected by exposure to contact current at levels of 3 mA or lower for exposures of up to 21 d or 4 wk.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Analysis of the literature using electronic libraries (PubMed, Medline), German veterinary medical journals and obstetrical textbooks. RESULTS: The therapy includes the attempt to rotate the uterus back into its physiological position. Direct and indirect methods of retorsion are available and applied according to the case conditions. Subsequently, the extraction of the calf can be performed via vaginal delivery or caesarean section. The presence of uterine torsion always leads to dystocia. Following a successful retorsion, the time and degree of uterine torsion strongly influence the progress of the birth. The prognosis also depends on the aforementioned factors and varies between good to unsuccessful. The vitality of the calf displays great variation depending on the literature (14-90\%), however, is generally greater under field than clinical conditions. Focussing on the puerperal development of the cow, all grades from mild irritations of the uterine involution to fatal complications occur. The influence on fertility depends on the progress of the birth and existing secondary complications. The risk for electrolyte disturbances is increased (approximately 50\%) as is the risk of birth-associated injuries (approximately 20\%). The incidence of placental retention varies widely between different authors (3-52\%).},

RESULTS: Uterine torsion is a very important maternal reason for dystocia as most cases occur during parturition. The post-cervical torsion (combined uterine and vaginal torsion, Torsio uteri and vaginae) is more commonly diagnosed than an intra-cervical or pre-cervical torsion. Torsions to the left occur more frequently than to the right. Clinical symptoms clearly vary depending on the degree of torsion. The frequency in relation to all parturitions is described as between 0.5 and 1\%, whereas the percentage of uterine torsions presented to the veterinarian as a reason for dystocia varies between 2.7 and 65\%. The pathogenesis of uterine torsion remains unclear; however, general agreement exists that the cow is predisposed to uterine torsion due to its anatomy. It appears that the Brown Swiss is more often affected than other cattle breeds.},

The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the methodological quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of animal studies in dentistry through using a validated checklist. A literature search was conducted independently and in duplicate in the PubMed and LILACS databases. References in selected systematic reviews were assessed to identify other studies not captured by the electronic searches. The methodological quality of studies was assessed independently and in duplicate by using the AMSTAR checklist; the quality was scored as low, moderate, or high. The reviewers were calibrated before the assessment and agreement between them was assessed using Cohen's Kappa statistic. Of 444 studies retrieved, 54 systematic reviews were selected after full-text assessment. Agreement between the reviewers was regarded as excellent. Only two studies were scored as high quality; 17 and 35 studies were scored as medium and low quality, respectively. There is room for improvement of the methodological quality of systematic reviews of animal studies in dentistry. Checklists, such as AMSTAR, can guide researchers in planning and executing systematic reviews and meta-analyses. For determining the need for additional investigations in animals and in order to provide good data for potential application in human, such reviews should be based on animal experiments performed according to sound methodological principles.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anthelmintic drugs have been widely used in sheep as a cost-effective means for gastro-intestinal nematode (GIN) control. However, growing anthelmintic resistance (AHR) has created a compelling need to identify evidence-based management recommendations that reduce the risk of further development and impact of AHR. OBJECTIVE: To identify, critically assess, and synthesize available data from primary research on factors associated with AHR in sheep. METHODS: Publications reporting original observational or experimental research on selected factors associated with AHR in sheep GINs and published after 1974, were identified through two processes. Three electronic databases (PubMed, Agricola, CAB) and Web of Science (a collection of databases) were searched for potentially relevant publications. Additional publications were identified through consultation with experts, manual search of references of included publications and conference proceedings, and information solicited from small ruminant practitioner list-serves. Two independent investigators screened abstracts for relevance. Relevant publications were assessed for risk of systematic bias. Where sufficient data were available, random-effects Meta-Analyses (MAs) were performed to estimate the pooled Odds Ratio (OR) and 95\% Confidence Intervals (CIs) of AHR for factors reported in {\textgreater}/=2 publications. RESULTS: Of the 1712 abstracts screened for eligibility, 131 were deemed relevant for full publication review. Thirty publications describing 25 individual studies (15 observational studies, 7 challenge trials, and 3 controlled trials) were included in the qualitative synthesis and assessed for systematic bias. Unclear (i.e. not reported, or unable to assess) or high risk of selection bias and confounding bias was found in 93\% (14/15) and 60\% (9/15) of the observational studies, respectively, while unclear risk of selection bias was identified in all of the trials. Ten independent studies were included in the quantitative synthesis, and MAs were performed for five factors. Only high frequency of treatment was a significant risk factor (OR=4.39; 95\% CI=1.59, 12.14), while the remaining 4 variables were marginally significant: mixed-species grazing (OR=1.63; 95\% CI=0.66, 4.07); flock size (OR=1.02; 95\% CI=0.97, 1.07); use of long-acting drug formulations (OR=2.85; 95\% CI=0.79, 10.24); and drench-and-shift pasture management (OR=4.08; 95\% CI=0.75, 22.16). CONCLUSIONS: While there is abundant literature on the topic of AHR in sheep GINs, few studies have explicitly investigated the association between putative risk or protective factors and AHR. Consequently, several of the current recommendations on parasite management are not evidence-based. Moreover, many of the studies included in this review had a high or unclear risk of systematic bias, highlighting the need to improve study design and/or reporting of future research carried out in this field.},

Meta-analysis revealed that the probiotics promoted better weight gain and feed conversion than the negative control (no antimicrobial) in the initial phase (1 to 20-28 days); nevertheless, results were similar to the whole duration of the study (1 to 35-48 days). Weight gain and feed conversion were similar between probiotics fed and the positive control (with antimicrobial) birds in the initial and whole experimental period. Sensitivity analysis showed that the results of meta-analysis were coherent. The funnel plots and the Egger regression method revealed that the studies published in Brazil do not present biased results. It is concluded that the probiotics are technically viable alternative to antimicrobial growth promoters in broiler feeding. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to identify the differences among the commercially available probiotics in Brazil.},

	abstract = {Decreasing feed costs while maintaining broiler performance at a high level with minimal environmental pollution has become a major challenge for poultry nutritionists in recent years. In this regard, phosphorus (P) is a nutrient that is problematic. To overcome this, a comprehensive knowledge of the responses of broilers to P is needed and the factors that affect its utilization need better understanding. For this purpose, a meta-analysis was conducted using results published in the literature on the responses of broilers to different levels of nonphytate P (NPP), calcium (Ca), microbial phytase (MP), and vitamin D3 or its metabolites (VD). The effects of Ca, MP, and VD on NPP requirements were investigated. Results showed significant (P {\textless}/= 0.0001) linear and quadratic effects of NPP on all the responses, viz. average daily gain (ADG), feed intake (FI), feed efficiency (FE), and tibia ash concentration (TA). Results showed the negative effect of high Ca levels on all investigated responses, although these deleterious effects were alleviated when levels of NPP were increased or MP and/or VD added. Synergistic effects of MP and VD on FI and TA were observed. Best performance for all responses was found when MP and VD were added to low or moderate levels of Ca and NPP. Optimization showed higher levels of NPP are required to maximize TA compared to ADG, FI, and FE. Based on our analysis, requirements for NPP were affected mostly by Ca (increased) and MP (decreased), and, to a lesser extent, VD (inconsistent).},

In total, 12 estimates for CFT and CFT-CCT test Se and Sp were identified from seven publications matching inclusion criteria. Estimates for CFT test Se ranged from 80.4\% to 93.0\% and CFT test Sp from 89.2\% to 95.2\%. Estimates for CFT-CCT test Se ranged from 74.4\% to 88.4\% and CFT-CCT test Sp ranged from 97.3\% to 98.6\%. These distributions of test Se and Sp are intended to provide a more realistic representation for U.S. bTb skin tests than previously reported. Estimation and discussion of herd-level CFT and CFT-CCT test parameters is also included.

Our literature review indicates that there is a relative lack of published literature that connects veterinary public health educational interventions to population health outcomes. Reasons for the lack of evidence to connect educational programs and population health outcomes include the evaluation of outcomes on a short-term rather than intermediate- or long-term basis, a lack of experimental studies, and infrequent grounding in population health or educational theory.

The aim of the present study was to systematically review the prevalence of paratuberculosis among farmed animals (cattle, sheep, and goats) in Latin America and the Caribbean. The initial search for existing publications reporting systematic reviews and primary studies was carried out by searching the available databases. For the final selection of studies, an initial screen for basic eligibility and a detailed appraisal of quality were performed. After study selection, the relevant data were extracted. The detailed appraisal generated 24 publications that reported 52 studies, of which 73.1, 11.5, and 15.4 \% were from cattle, sheep, and goats, respectively. Thirty-three (63.5 \%) of the studies were animal level studies, while 19 (36.5 \%) were herd-/flock-level studies. No flock-level studies on prevalence in sheep were found. Studies in Latin American and Caribbean countries revealed an overall prevalence of 16.9 (95 \% CI (confidence interval) 13.2-20.5) and 75.8 \% (95 \% CI 50.1-101.5) in cattle at the animal and herd levels, respectively; the prevalence was 16 \% (95 \% CI 7.9-24.1) in sheep at the animal level and 4.3 \% (95 \% CI 1.9-6.8) and 3.7 \% (95 \% CI 0.1-7.4) in goats at the animal and flock levels, respectively. In general, prevalence results reported by the studies were insufficient to accurately determine the prevalence of paratuberculosis in farmed animals in Latin America and the Caribbean. Several flaws in the design of studies limit the quality of evidence regarding the prevalence of paratuberculosis in the region.},

Therefore, the objective of this study was to perform a meta-analysis using literature data on the effects of WPCS hybrid type on intake, digestibility, rumen fermentation, and lactation performance by dairy cows. The meta-analysis was performed using a data set of 162 treatment means from 48 peer-reviewed articles published between 1995 and 2014. Hybrids were divided into 3 categories before analysis. Comparative analysis of WPCS hybrid types differing in stalk characteristics were in 4 categories: conventional, dual-purpose, isogenic, or low-normal fiber digestibility (CONS), brown midrib (BMR), hybrids with greater NDF but lower lignin (\%NDF) contents or high in vitro NDF digestibility (HFD), and leafy (LFY). Hybrid types differing in kernel characteristics were in 4 categories: conventional or yellow dent (CONG), NutriDense (ND), high oil (HO), and waxy. Genetically modified (GM) hybrids were compared with their genetically similar non-biotech counterpart (ISO). Except for lower lignin content for BMR and lower starch content for HFD than CONS and LFY, silage nutrient composition was similar among hybrids of different stalk types. A 1.1 kg/d greater intake of DM and 1.5 and 0.05 kg/d greater milk and protein yields, respectively, were observed for BMR compared with CONS and LFY. Likewise, DMI and milk yield were greater for HFD than CONS, but the magnitude of the difference was smaller. Total-tract NDF digestibility was greater, but starch digestibility was reduced, for BMR and HFD compared with CONS or LFY. Silage nutrient composition was similar for hybrids of varied kernel characteristics, except for lower CP and EE content for CONG than ND and HO. Feeding HO WPCS to dairy cows decreased milk fat content and yield and protein content compared with the other kernel-type hybrids. Hybrids varying in kernel characteristics did not affect intake, milk production, or total-tract nutrient digestibilities by lactating dairy cows. Nutrient composition and lactation performance were similar between GM and ISO. Positive effects of BMR and HFD on intake and milk yield were observed for lactating dairy cows, but the reduced total-tract starch digestibility for these hybrids merits further study. Except for negative effects of HO on milk components, differences were minimal among corn silage hybrids differing in kernel type. Feeding GM WPCS did not affect lactation performance by dairy cows.},

The aim of this study was to determine whether there is evidence that the use of MCT reduces consumption and body weight gain in rats, a species chosen as it has been widely used as an animal model in different surveys. A search of scientific work was performed in November 2011 on two bases: 'Web of Science' and 'PubMed'. The terms sample size and homogeneity, randomisation, food consumption and weight gain, body composition, enzyme activity and hormonal activity in rats were used as selection criteria. Thirteen papers were selected after the refinement of the research. Twelve studies measured weight gain and among these, seven detected a decrease in weight gain and five found no differences. Twelve papers also measured food intake and among these, four detected a decrease in consumption, one detected an increase and seven found no differences. Based on established criteria for the ranking of scientific papers, it is concluded that there is strong evidence that MCTs can effectively reduce the consumption and subsequent weight gain of animals. However, in the long term, there may not be differences in results depending on the phenotypic adaptation of animals to a new metabolic condition.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) is gaining popularity as part of therapy programs in residential aged care facilities. Humans and pet dogs respond to quiet interaction with a lowering of blood pressure and an increase in neurochemicals associated with relaxation and bonding. These effects may be of benefit in ameliorating behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). METHODS: Medline, PsychInfo and CINAHL databases (1960-2005) were searched for papers on AAT or pets and dementia. Publications of controlled trials that measured the effect of AAT for dementia were reviewed. RESULTS: Several small studies suggest that the presence of a dog reduces aggression and agitation, as well as promoting social behavior in people with dementia. One study has shown that aquaria in dining rooms of dementia care units stimulate residents to eat more of their meals and to gain weight but is limited by the small number of facilities studied. There is preliminary evidence that robotic pets may provide pleasure and interest to people with dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Current literature suggests that AAT may ameliorate BPSD, but the duration of the beneficial effect has not been explored. The relative benefits of "resident" versus "visiting" pet dogs are unclear and are confounded by the positive effect of pet interaction on staff or caregivers. Further research on the potential benefits of AAT is recommended.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Domestic cats have evolved from solitary, asocial predators and whilst they may display social behaviours, they can still exist as solitary survivors. Over-population and relinquishment of pet cats are ubiquitous problems worldwide, and rehoming centres (also known as rescues/ shelters) aim to ameliorate this by holding cats in confinement for a variable period until a new home is found. The provision of optimal housing for large numbers of cats in close confinement, such as in rehoming centres, is therefore inherently difficult. Under these conditions there is the potential for individuals to develop signs of physical and psychological ill health, and thus experience compromised welfare. Available information regarding housing practices that maximise welfare currently provides conflicting results, and as a consequence there are no unanimous housing recommendations. The aim of this study was therefore to review the evidence on the impact of single housing compared to multi-cat housing on stress in confined cats, as measured by physiological and/or behavioural outcomes. The review was conducted using a Critically Appraised Topic (CAT) format. A systematic search of electronic databases (CAB Abstracts, Zoological Records and Medline) was carried out to identify peer-reviewed literature comparing single and multi-cat housing in confined environments. RESULTS: A total of 959 papers were initially identified, six of which met sufficient criteria based on their relevance to be included within this review. All of the studies had significant limitations in design and methodology, including a lack of information on how groups were assigned, inconsistent handling and enrichment provision between groups, and lack of information on the socialisation status of cats. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst some studies suggested that single housing may be less stressful for cats, others suggested group housing was less stressful. Several other important factors were however identified as potential mediators of stress within the different housing systems, and recommendations based upon these findings are presented.},

DESIGN: Six questions were considered, addressing sampling site, collection system, anticoagulant, collection procedure, and sample storage. Standardized, systematic evaluation of the literature was performed. Relevant articles were categorized according to level of evidence (LOE). Consensus was developed regarding conclusions for application of concepts to clinical practice. SETTING: Academic and referral veterinary medical centers. RESULTS: PubMed and CAB abstracts were searched. Eighteen papers were initially chosen; 5 of these papers applied to {\textgreater} 1 domain question. Three papers were used to address 2 questions each, and 2 papers were used to address 3 questions each. Most papers were judged LOE 3 (Good or Fair). Two of 5 papers were judged to be the same LOE each time they were used; 2 papers were judged to be LOE 3, Fair for 1 question and 3, Good for a second question; 1 paper used to address 3 questions was judged LOE 3, Good twice and 3, Fair once. Fourteen additional papers were evaluated post hoc during manuscript preparation. CONCLUSIONS: Jugular venipuncture is recommended, but samples from IV catheters can be used. Consistent technique is important for serial sampling, and standardized sampling protocols are recommended for individual centers performing TEG/ROTEM. There is insufficient evidence to recommend use of a specific blood collection system, although use of evacuated blood tubes and 21-Ga or larger needles is suggested. Use of 3.2\% buffered sodium citrate in a strict 1:9 ratio of citrate to blood is suggested. Suggested tube draw order is discard/serum, followed by citrate, EDTA, and then heparin. Samples should be held at room temperature for 30 minutes prior to analysis.},

	abstract = {Effects on reproduction of dystocia, stillbirth, abortion, milk fever, retained placenta, metritis, cystic ovaries, anestrus, ketosis, displaced abomasum, locomotor disorders, and mastitis were reviewed. Papers were considered if they provided quantitative estimates of diseases on days to first estrus, days to first service, conception rate at first service, days from first service to conception, days to conception or days open, calving interval, conception rates at various days post partum (dpp), and number of services per conception or per cow. Only papers in English in peer-reviewed journals were selected for analysis of post 1960 data from intensive dairy regions. Seventy papers fulfilled the selection criteria. Summary estimates of disease effects were calculated according to meta-analysis methods, and study designs were described in detail to identify possible heterogeneity of the results. Stillbirth, milk fever, displaced abomasum and mastitis had no effect on reproduction. Clinical ketosis, dystocia and retained placenta were associated with 2 to 3 more days to first service and with a 4 to 10\% lower conception rate at first service, resulting in 6 to 12 more days to conception. Locomotor disorders were associated with an average increase of 12 d to conception, with wide variation depending on lesions and stage of occurrence. Metritis was associated with 7 more days to first service, 20\% lower conception rate at first service, resulting in 19 more days to conception. Cystic ovaries were associated with 6 to 11 more days to first service and with 20 to 30 more days to conception. Anestrus was associated with 26 more days to first service and with an 18\% lower conception rate at first service, resulting in 41 more days to conception. Abortion was associated with 70 to 80 more days to conception.},

Relevant literature will be identified using a combination of database search strategies and iterative screening of references. To be included in the review, articles will have to: (1) be published after 1969; (2) be written in English, French, or Spanish; (3) use a study design such as a controlled trial, an observational study, or an experimental study conducted in vivo; (4) be conducted on commercial dairy cows; (5) investigate a non-antibiotic intervention used at dry off; and finally, (6) report on a relevant mastitis outcome. Titles and abstracts, then full articles will be reviewed for inclusion. Specific data will be extracted and risk of bias will be assessed for all included articles.

DESIGN: Systematic review. STUDY POPULATION: Reports of prospective studies published from January 1998 through December 2008. PROCEDURES: The MEDLINE and CAB Abstracts databases were searched with the following key terms: dog OR dogs OR canine OR cat OR cats OR feline AND pheromone OR synthetic pheromone OR facial pheromone OR appeasing pheromone. A date limit was set from 1998 through 2008. Identified reports for dogs (n = 7) and cats (7) were systematically reviewed. RESULTS: Studies provided insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of feline facial pheromone for management of idiopathic cystitis or calming cats during catheterization and lack of support for reducing stress in hospitalized cats. Only 1 study yielded sufficient evidence that dog-appeasing pheromone reduces fear or anxiety in dogs during training. Six studies yielded insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of dog-appeasing pheromone for treatment of noise phobia (2 reports), travel-related problems, fear or anxiety in the veterinary clinic, and stress- and fear-related behavior in shelter dogs as well as vocalizing and house soiling in recently adopted puppies. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: 11 of the 14 reports reviewed provided insufficient evidence and 1 provided lack of support for effectiveness of pheromones for the treatment of undesirable behavior in cats and dogs.},

	abstract = {Personality, or consistent individual differences in behavior, is well established in studies of dogs. Such consistency implies predictability of behavior, but some recent research suggests that predictability cannot be assumed. In addition, anecdotally, many dog experts believe that 'puppy tests' measuring behavior during the first year of a dog's life are not accurate indicators of subsequent adult behavior. Personality consistency in dogs is an important aspect of human-dog relationships (e.g., when selecting dogs suitable for substance-detection work or placement in a family). Here we perform the first comprehensive meta-analysis of studies reporting estimates of temporal consistency of dog personality. A thorough literature search identified 31 studies suitable for inclusion in our meta-analysis. Overall, we found evidence to suggest substantial consistency (r = 0.43). Furthermore, personality consistency was higher in older dogs, when behavioral assessment intervals were shorter, and when the measurement tool was exactly the same in both assessments. In puppies, aggression and submissiveness were the most consistent dimensions, while responsiveness to training, fearfulness, and sociability were the least consistent dimensions. In adult dogs, there were no dimension-based differences in consistency. There was no difference in personality consistency in dogs tested first as puppies and later as adults (e.g., 'puppy tests') versus dogs tested first as puppies and later again as puppies. Finally, there were no differences in consistency between working versus non-working dogs, between behavioral codings versus behavioral ratings, and between aggregate versus single measures. Implications for theory, practice, and future research are discussed.},

	abstract = {Research synthesis, using techniques such as meta-analysis to combine the results of a number of studies, is a particularly useful technique when there are multiple studies with conflicting results, or where there may be conflicting interests, and can serve to extract the maximum information from animal experiments. The effect of conventional cages and alternative housing systems on measures of production, behaviour, physical and physiological condition in laying hens is an important question that would benefit from research synthesis. We found that statistical constraints did not allow the usual methods of meta-analysis, so as a first step towards quantitative comparison, we used a simple vote-counting approach based on the treatment means. We counted the number of papers in which conventional cages or alternative systems had a higher weighted mean for various response variables. Egg production was higher in conventional cages than in alternative systems, though this effect was probably mostly confined to the comparison with multi-level indoor systems. Bones were stronger from hens kept in alternative systems than those kept in conventional cages. We confirmed previous reviews that birds show more comfort behaviour and possibly dustbathing (or vacuum dustbathing) behaviour in alternative systems, but aggressive pecking did not differ between systems. Perhaps surprisingly, mortality, feather pecking and body wounds were not found to differ between systems. The latter findings suggest that the chance of a mortality or cannibalism outbreak may be no greater in alternative systems than in cage systems, but it should be noted that our analysis did not consider the magnitude of the difference in mortality. In conclusion, the meta-comparison undertaken here supports some but contradicts other conclusions reached in qualitative reviews.},

	abstract = {Growth of calves during their first few weeks of life is one of the most important factors affecting their performance during subsequent rearing, and it can be modified by disease, especially gastrointestinal infections. Use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) is a tool which may maintain the intestinal microbial balance, prevent diarrhea and improve growth. However, a consensus has not been reached as to whether probiotics are effective in improving growth of calves. The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess effects of probiotics on the growth of calves (\_i.e.\_, body weight gain (BWG), feed efficiency). PubMed and Scopus databases were searched from 1980 to 2010, unrestricted by language. The inclusion criteria were: randomized and controlled experiments using calves less than 5 d of age without apparent disease and with passive immunity, and published in peer reviewed journals. Twenty-one and 14 studies were included to assess probiotic effects on BWG and feed efficiency, respectively. LAB supplementation increased BWG (standardized mean differences (SMD)=0.22822, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.1006-0.4638) and improve feed efficiency (SMD=-0.8141, 95\% CI -1.2222 to -0.4059), considering the source of heterogeneity and publication biases. Growth of calves was not affected when the LAB was added to whole milk, but beneficial effects occurred when LAB was added to milk replacer. The probiotic effect was not related to the number of LAB strains in the inoculum. The number of calves in the experiments had an impact on the results and conclusions. Probiotics may be an alternative to the antibiotics commonly used as growth promoters in calves.},

	abstract = {The importance of livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (LA-MRSA) as an infectious agent for humans has increased in recent years in Germany. Although it is well known that the prevalence of MRSA in pig farms is high, risk factors for the presence of MRSA in herds of fattening pigs are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate available data from previous studies on MRSA in fattening pigs in a meta-analysis to answer the question: What are the factors associated with the occurrence of MRSA in fattening pig herds? The studies on MRSA in pigs that were identified by literature research were heterogeneous with respect to the risk factors investigated and the type of herds focused on. Therefore we decided to carry out a pooling analysis on herd level rather than a typical meta-analysis. Eligible herd data were identified based on the published literature and communication with the authors. The final data set covered 400 fattening pig herds from 10 different studies and 12 risk factors. The prevalence of MRSA in the 400 fattening pig herds was 53.5\%. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE). The resulting multivariate model confirmed previously identified risk factors for MRSA in pig herds (herd size and herd type). It also identified further risk factors: group treatment of fattening pigs with antimicrobial drugs (OR=1.79) and housing fattening pig herds on at least partially slatted floors (OR=2.39) compared to plain floor. In contrast, according to the model, fattening pig herds on farms keeping other livestock along with pigs were less likely to harbor MRSA (OR=0.54). The results underline the benefits from a pooling analysis and cooperative re-evaluation of published data.},

Glenn, Bacon, \& Hanlin comb. Nov.] tall fescue [ (Schreb.) Darbysh.]. The strategies presented include those 1) applied with forage systems, 2) based on pharmacological compounds and functional foods, and 3) based on supplemental dietary nutrients. Cattle BW gain and DM intake was the dependent response evaluated. Among the forage systems reviewed, studies with nontoxic, endophyte-infected tall fescue as a total replacement forage system demonstrated the greatest improvement in per-hectare (152 +/- 27.5 kg/ha) and per-animal (0.29 +/- 0.03 kg/d) BW gain. Studies with interseeded legumes have exhibited a small and highly variable BW gain effect size per hectare (52 +/- 24.1 kg/ha) and per animal (0.11 +/- 0.03 kg/d). The legume response was seasonal, with summer exhibiting the greatest benefit. Studies with chemicals that suppress plant growth demonstrated BW gain responses (0.17 +/- 0.06 kg/d) equal to or greater than the response observed with legume studies. Cattle grazing toxic tall fescue responded well to anthelmentics, antimicrobial feed additives, and steroid implants, and the use of these technologies may additively help recover production losses. As a group, functional foods have not improved BW gain ( = 0.85). Studies with cattle supplemented with highly digestible fiber supplements observed a 0.15 kg greater BW gain compared with studies using starch- and sugar-based supplements ( {\textless} 0.05). Weight gain was positively impacted by the level of supplementation (0.06 kg/DM intake as percent BW). Supplement feed conversion was estimated at 6:1 for the highly digestible fiber supplements compared with 11:1 for starch-based supplements. Tall fescue forage DM intake was predicted to maximize at a supplemental feeding rate of 0.24\% BW with a breakpoint at 0.5\% BW, and total maximum DM intake (forage plus supplement) occurred at 2.7\% BW when supplemental feeding approached 0.9\% BW. Results from this meta-analysis should be useful for 1) establishing and comparing measured responses to theoretical improvements in BW gain when additive strategies are considered, 2) research planning, and 3) producer education.},

	abstract = {One of the main Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyopneumoniae) swine experimental model objectives is to reproduce mycoplasmal pneumonia (MP). Unfortunately, experimental validated protocols to maximize the chance to successfully achieve lung lesions induced by M. hyopneumoniae are not available at the moment. Thus, the objective of this work was to identify those factors that might have a major influence on the effective development of MP, measured as macroscopic lung lesions, under experimental conditions. Data from 85 studies describing M. hyopneumoniae inoculation experiments were compiled by means of a systematic review and analyzed thereafter. Several variables were considered in the analyses such as the number of pigs in the experiment, serological status against M. hyopneumoniae, source of the animals, age at inoculation, type of inoculum, strain of M. hyopneumoniae, route, dose and times of inoculation, study duration and co-infection with other swine pathogens. Descriptive statistics were used to depict M. hyopneumoniae experimental model main characteristics whereas a recursive partitioning approach, using regression trees, assessed the importance of the abovementioned experimental variables as MP triggering factors. A strong link between the time period between challenge and necropsies and lung lesion severity was observed. Results indicated that the most important factors to explain the observed lung lesion score variability were: (1) study duration, (2) M. hyopneumoniae strain, (3) age at inoculation, (4) co-infection with other swine pathogens and (5) animal source. All other studied variables were not relevant to explain the variability on M. hyopneumoniae lung lesions. The results provided in the present work may serve as a basis for debate in the search for a universally accepted M. hyopneumoniae challenge model.},

Most studies show important implications for this type of research, but there is no consensus on terminology, method, or conclusions for felids, even at the species level. Felid personality research comes from various fields, and is often carried out with different methods, with diverse goals. This review evaluates the published research on felid personality, and addresses its reliability and validity. Only 60\% of the studies reported reliability estimates, and these varied greatly across personality dimensions. The sample weighted mean correlation of the reliability estimates was 0.68 (based on three studies). Fifty-five percent of the studies assessed validity. The personality dimensions with the highest validity for all species were Sociable, Dominant, and Curious, with a mean correlation of 0.82. Recommendations for future research and implications for aiding in conservation and captive animal management efforts and improving health and well-being and welfare are discussed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Toxoplasmosis is a worldwide zoonosis. The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence and assess the potential risk factors of Toxoplasma gondii infections in animals and humans in Ethiopia by using meta-analytical methods. METHODS: Published studies on T. gondii in animals and humans in Ethiopia were searched in Medline, Google Scholar and the lists of references of articles. Eligible studies were selected by using inclusion and exclusion criteria. The risks of within and across study biases, and the variations in prevalence estimates attributable to heterogeneities were assessed. Pooled prevalence was estimated by the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. RESULTS: Thirty two studies were eligible and data from 5689 animals and 5718 humans were used for quantitative syntheses. The pooled IgG seroprevalence in cats, small ruminants and humans were estimated at 87.72\% (95\% CI = 78.63, 93.28), 34.59\% (95\% CI = 21.08, 51.12) and 74.73\% (95\% CI = 61.85, 84.36), respectively. The odds of infections were higher in pregnant than in non pregnant women (OR = 3.96), in individuals that had contact with cats than those with no contact (OR = 2.53), and in urban than in rural inhabitants (OR = 2.06). CONCLUSIONS: Toxoplasmosis is highly prevalent and could be a cause of considerable reproductive wastage in small ruminants and multiple diseases in humans in Ethiopia. Public education on preventive measures could help reduce the transmission of the parasite to humans.},

There is however increasing evidence that intralesional treatments with cells, blood products, scaffolds and biological factors such as growth factors have a regenerative effect. In the present review the principal scientific findings on the clinical effects in living horses of, for example, bone-marrow-derived and adipose-tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and blood products such as PRP (platelet rich plasma), ACP (autologous conditioned plasma) and ACS (autologous conditioned serum) are summarized and discussed. Relating to horses, several scientific investigations with different study designs can be found in the literature: (1) Clinical case series, which allow a limited comparison of different treatment methods on the basis of the resulting recurrence rate. (2) Experimental animal studies on controlled artificial tendon defects, which often provide detailed results on the histological, biochemical and biomechanical quality of repair tissue. (3) Single placebo-controlled studies of naturally occurring tendinopathies which should, at least theoretically, provide the highest degree of evidence, however show methodological weaknesses in many cases. Among other aspects, the advantages and disadvantages of the various substrates, their biological safety, their effect with regard to the structural and biomechanical properties of different tendons and ligaments and their effect on the recurrence rate of tendon and ligament disorders are described and discussed. There is increasing evidence that substrates with regenerative potential are superior to other, i.e. conventional, treatments although it is still not clear which product or combination of substrates is most appropriate in individual cases.},

	abstract = {Conventional treatments of equine tendon injuries lead to an unsatisfactory healing process that usually results in a relatively high recurrence rate. Therefore, in recent years so-called regenerative therapeutics were studied scientifically in vitro and in laboratory animals. These include substances that ideally lead to the formation of replacement tissue, which in contrast to the low quality scar, has similar functional properties as the original intact tendon. Currently, a plethora of different substrates is either commercially available or can be produced in practice with the help of kits. The current knowledge on the production and the regenerative potential of nucleated cells like stem cells from bone marrow and fat tissue, of the blood products PRP (platelet rich plasma), ACP (autologous conditioned plasma), ACS (autologous conditioned serum) and of the scaffold substance UBM (urinary bladder matrix) are presented. Finally, the potential of some growth factors and of gene therapy is considered. Currently, it is assumed that the regeneration of tendon tissue is promoted by a complex interaction of scaffolds, growth factors and cells. At present, only very few studies are available which allow a comparison between these substances. Studies on the effect of regenerative substrates on tendons in live horses are presented elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Mastitis is among the most prevalent disease that contributes for the reduction of milk production in dairy herds. Although several published studies have estimated the prevalence of mastitis, variation among studies is great. The objective of the present meta-analysis was to provide a pooled estimate of the prevalence of overall, clinical, and subclinical mastitis in dairy cattle in Ethiopia. A pooled estimate was also conducted by potential risk factors. The literature search was restricted to studies published in English language from January 2002 to June 2016. Meta-analysis of 39 studies was done under random effects model using metafor package in R software. The pooled estimate of the overall prevalence of mastitis on cow-basis was found to be 47.0\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 42.0, 52.0). The pooled prevalence with the 95\% CI for clinical and subclinical mastitis was 8.3\% (95\% CI = 6.5, 10.3) and 37\% (95\% CI = 32.9, 40.7) respectively. There is a statistically significant and high heterogeneity of the prevalence estimates between published studies. The odds of occurrence of mastitis were higher in cows at early (odds ratio [OR] = 1.6; 95\% CI = 1.4, 1.8) and late lactation (OR = 1.3; 95\% CI = 1.2, 1.5) than mid lactation, in cows with 3-4 (OR = 1.5; 95\% CI = 1.4, 1.7) and {\textgreater}4 parity number (OR = 2.9; 95\% CI = 2.6, 3.4) than those with 1-2 parity number. Previous history of mastitis, floor type, milking hygiene, and udder injury had also statistically significant effect on pooled prevalence of mastitis (P {\textless} 0.05). The present study reported that there is high prevalence of mastitis in dairy cows in Ethiopia, which could contribute to the low productivity in lactating cows. The statistically significant association of risk factors such as floor type, milking hygiene, and presence of udder injury with mastitis may suggest that dairy farmers can reduce the occurrence of the disease by improving their management practices.},

All clinical trials to date have examined the effects of oestrogen alone or oestrogen-progestin combination therapy. Experimental studies have suggested that progesterone, in its own right, is a potential neuroprotective agent following acute cerebral injury. We performed a systematic review of controlled animal studies that administered progesterone before, or after, acute cerebral injury and measured lesion volume. Relevant studies were found from searching PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. From 119 identified publications, data from 18 studies using 480 experimental subjects met specific criteria and were analysed using the Cochrane Review Manager software. Following cerebral ischaemia, a significant benefit of progesterone was observed regardless of the assigned study quality score (P = 0.0002) whereas, following traumatic brain injury (TBI) a significant benefit of progesterone was only observed in studies that obtained the highest quality score of 5 (P = 0.02). Progesterone reduced lesion volume in a dose-dependent manner following either cerebral ischaemia (P {\textless} 0.001) or TBI (P = 0.03) with the most effective progesterone dose varying according to experimental injury model used. Progesterone treatment was only effective at reducing lesion volume when administered immediately following (i.e. 0-2 h) cerebral ischaemia (P = 0.0008). No studies using models of cerebral ischaemia or TBI assessed efficacy when progesterone was administered at later than 6 h following the onset of cerebral injury. Limited data were available for different groups of animals according to age/hormonal status and the full dose-response relationship was not available in all experimental groups. Although this systematic review provides some supporting evidence for a neuroprotective role of progesterone following either cerebral ischaemia or TBI importantly it highlights areas which need further pre-clinical investigation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quality of life (QOL) is an important consideration in healthcare decision-making for pets with cancer. To determine the effect of disease and treatment on pet QOL, this important variable should be objectively measured as an outcome in veterinary cancer studies. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and methodology of QOL measurement in a sample of recently published reports of prospective studies evaluating cancer treatments in client-owned dogs and cats; to characterize reporting of QOL outcomes and to identify article characteristics associated with QOL measurement. METHODS: English-language reports of prospective studies of cancer treatments in dogs and cats published from 2008 to 2013 were identified using medical research databases combined with a hand-searching strategy. Data pertaining to general article characteristics and QOL measurement were abstracted and summarized. RESULTS: Reports of 144 eligible studies were identified. QOL was measured in 16 (11.1\%) studies, with 8 (5.6\%) reporting the results. All studies that measured QOL reported using unvalidated instruments, or did not report how QOL was assessed. Only 1 study provided sufficient information for QOL measurements to be replicated. Recently published articles (2011-2013) were significantly more likely to report measuring QOL, compared with earlier articles. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life of pets undergoing cancer treatment is largely unreported and cannot be meaningfully compared across treatments or disease states using the existing literature. Reliable, validated instruments are needed to facilitate the measurement and comparison of pet QOL in veterinary cancer research. Consistent reporting practices could improve transparency and interpretation of QOL results.},

	abstract = {Bat-borne viruses carry undeniable risks to the health of human beings and animals, and there is growing recognition of the need for a 'One Health' approach to understand their frequently complex spill-over routes. While domesticated animals can play central roles in major spill-over events of zoonotic bat-borne viruses, for example during the pig-amplified Malaysian Nipah virus outbreak of 1998-1999, the extent of their potential to act as bridging or amplifying species for these viruses has not been characterised systematically. This review aims to compile current knowledge on the role of domesticated animals as hosts of two types of bat-borne viruses, henipaviruses and filoviruses. A systematic literature search of these virus-host interactions in domesticated animals identified 72 relevant studies, which were categorised by year, location, design and type of evidence generated. The review then focusses on Africa as a case study, comparing research efforts in domesticated animals and bats with the distributions of documented human cases. Major gaps remain in our knowledge of the potential ability of domesticated animals to contract or spread these zoonoses. Closing these gaps will be necessary to fully evaluate and mitigate spill-over risks of these viruses, especially with global agricultural intensification.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically examine the evidence relating to the performance of rotational viscoelastic testing in companion animals, to develop assay guidelines, and to identify knowledge gaps. DESIGN: Multiple questions were considered within 5 parent domains, specifically system comparability, sample handling, assay activation and test protocol, definitions and data reporting, and nonstandard assays. Standardized, systematic evaluation of the literature was performed. Relevant articles were categorized according to level of evidence and assessed for quality. Consensus was developed regarding conclusions for application of concepts to clinical practice. SETTING: Academic and referral veterinary medical centers. RESULTS: Databases searched included Medline, Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux abstracts, and Google Scholar. Worksheets were prepared evaluating 28 questions across the 5 domains and generating 84 assay guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based guidelines for the performance of thromboelastography in companion animals were generated through this process. Some of these guidelines are well supported while others will benefit from additional evidence. Many knowledge gaps were identified and future work should be directed to address these gaps and to objectively evaluate the impact of these guidelines on assay comparability within and between centers.},

Methods: Systematic searches of databases identified 67 studies that met inclusion criteria. Each study was analysed and summarised in terms of (a) strategies used to evoke anxiety, (b) non-verbal behavioural indicators of anxiety and (c) physiological indicators of anxiety. Results: Eighteen strategies were used to evoke anxiety, 48 non-verbal behavioural indicators and 17 physiological indicators of anxiety were measured. Conclusions: A number of the strategies used with non-human primates, if modified carefully, could be considered in the ongoing effort to study anxiety in individuals with ASD. Potential applications to the assessment of anxiety in humans with ASD are discussed.},

Means of crown-rump length (CRL) and BW records, as well as means of calculated G index (GI, BW/CRL1.5), body mass index (BMI, BW/CRL2.0), and Ponderal index (PI, BW/CRL3.0) of 195 nontreated and 160 treated groups of lambs from 131 studies were investigated by ANOVA. the GI is a novel BW-body length index developed for sheep fetuses and newborn lambs. The analysis included the effects of study (n=131), treatment (n=38), average litter size (1 to 3), and days in pregnancy (120 d to lambing). The morphometric parameters were obtained on average on d 139 of gestation, when lambs in the nontreated groups averaged 0.50 m for CRL and 4.20 kg for BW. applying the different treatments caused substantial variation in fetal BW (from 2.5 to 4.9 kg), and somewhat less variation in fetal CRL (0.41 to 0.55 m), reflecting ovine fetal ability to adapt its growth to a variety of natural and experimental constraints. Some treatments affected (P{\textless}0.05) the fetal BW-body length relationship, as clearly reflected by the GI and BMI, but not by the PI. litter size and days in pregnancy had effects (P{\textless}0.05) on all variables. It was concluded that the severity of fetal intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) in the case of multifetus pregnancies is comparable with the IUGR effects caused by experimentally induced fetal growth-inhibiting interventions, and that GI may be superior to BMI and PI in detecting interference with ovine fetal body proportion.},

	abstract = {It is increasingly recognised that diabetic remission is possible in the cat. This systematic review, following Cochrane Collaboration (CC) guidelines, critically appraises the level of evidence on factors influencing remission rate and factors predicting remission. A systematic online, bibliographic search and reference list examination was conducted. A level of evidence was assigned to each identified article by five internists using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for follow-up, cohort, case-series and case-control studies, the CC's risk of bias tool for trials and the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group risk of bias criteria for before and after trials. Twenty-two studies were included in the review, assessing influence of pharmaceutical intervention (n = 14) and diet (n = 4), as well as diagnostic tests (n = 9) and feline patient characteristics (n = 5) as predictors of remission. The current level of evidence was found to be moderate to poor. Common sources of bias included lack of randomisation and blinding among trials, and many studies were affected by small sample size. Failure to provide criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes, or diabetic remission, and poor control of confounding factors were frequent causes of poor study design. Addressing these factors would significantly strengthen future research and ultimately allow meta-analyses to provide an excellent level of evidence. No single factor predicts remission and successful remission has been documented with a variety of insulin types and protocols. Dietary carbohydrate reduction might be beneficial, but requires further study. A lack of well-designed trials prevents reliable remission rate comparison. Factors associated with remission resemble those in human medicine and support the hypothesis that reversal of glucotoxicity is a major underlying mechanism for feline diabetic remission.},

In total we downloaded 1,125 abstracts, which were classified into the following categories: year of publication; environment of the study (e.g., zoo) or theoretical; area of knowledge (e.g., conservation in situ); number of experimental animals used; species; addresses of authors; taxonomic classification; publication language; journal name; number of citations received. Since 1990, there has been a rapid increase in the number of articles published in this area of animal welfare. One worrying result was that published articles were predominately of a theoretical nature (58.65\%, N=563). Most of the articles were published by authors either in Europe (47.43\%, N=480) or North America (37.65\%, N=381) and written in English (87.71\%, N=971). The majority of experimental studies were conducted with mammals (75.92\%, N=391), and had small sample sizes (N=7 for zoo-based studies). In terms of impact factor (IF), the journals in this study had a median factor equivalent to that for the area of biological sciences (median IF=1.013). Little knowledge cross-over from farm animal welfare was found (only four articles) in this study. In conclusion, zoo and wild animal welfare as a science may benefit from a greater interaction with farm animal welfare.},

However, these formulations should minimally impact the behavior of individuals and populations before a contraceptive is used for population manipulation, but these effects have received less attention. Potential side effects have been identified theoretically and we reviewed published studies that have investigated side effects on behavior and physiology of individuals or population-level effects, which provided mixed results. Physiological side effects were most prevalent. Most studies reported a lack of secondary effects, but were usually based on qualitative data or anecdotes. A meta-analysis on quantitative studies of side effects showed that secondary effects consistently occur across all categories and all contraceptive types. This contrasts with the qualitative studies, suggesting that anecdotal reports are insufficient to investigate secondary impacts of contraceptive treatment. We conclude that more research is needed to address fundamental questions about secondary effects of contraceptive treatment and experiments are fundamental to conclusions. In addition, researchers are missing a vital opportunity to use contraceptives as an experimental tool to test the influence of reproduction, sex and fertility on the behavior of wildlife species.},

Our objective was to identify, critically evaluate and synthesize published intervention research reporting treatment efficacy at the abattoir on \_E. coli\_ contamination of beef carcasses using systematic review (SR)-meta-analysis (MA) methodology to recommend effective practices and determine knowledge gaps. Four electronic bibliographic databases were searched for intervention studies in English. Two independent reviewers performed all SR steps. Risk of bias was assessed and separate random-effects MAs conducted on datasets. A stochastic simulation model using MA effect estimates evaluated combined effects of potable water carcass wash, steam or hot water pasteurization and a 24 h dry chill. The SR-MA included 36 citations (202 trials). Although 44 interventions were identified at nine stages of processing, MA was precluded for most due to small study numbers, high risk of bias and heterogeneity. Reduced odds of generic \_E. coli\_ carcass contamination demonstrated by MA: final carcass washing (OR 0.56, CI: 0.41-0.77), pasteurization (OR 0.09, CI: 0.06-0.14) and 24 h dry chilling (OR 0.17, CI: 0.11-0.24). Combining effects of potable water carcass wash, steam or hot water pasteurization and a 24 h dry chill, assuming no additional contamination and all variables constant, resulted in a reduced prevalence of 1.22\% (CI 0.17, 3.57). The predicted risk difference in carcass contamination was 14, 42 and 35 per 100 carcasses upon application of final wash, carcass pasteurization and 24 h dry chill, respectively. Existing research indicates that final wash, hot water or steam pasteurization, and dry chilling are beneficial for reducing the contamination of beef carcasses with generic \_E. coli\_ and potentially pathogenic strains.},

	abstract = {Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is an economically important disease of cattle and continues to be an intensely studied topic. However, literature summarizing the time between pathogen exposure and clinical signs, shedding, and seroconversion is minimal. A structured literature review of the published literature was performed to determine cattle responses (time from pathogen exposure to clinical signs, shedding, and seroconversion) in challenge models using common BRD viral and bacterial pathogens. After review a descriptive analysis of published studies using common BRD pathogen challenge studies was performed. Inclusion criteria were single pathogen challenge studies with no treatment or vaccination evaluating outcomes of interest: clinical signs, shedding, and seroconversion. Pathogens of interest included: bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), parainfluenza-3 virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, Mannheimia haemolytica, Mycoplasma bovis, Pastuerella multocida, and Histophilus somni. Thirty-five studies and 64 trials were included for analysis. The median days to the resolution of clinical signs after BVDV challenge was 15 and shedding was not detected on day 12 postchallenge. Resolution of BHV-1 shedding resolved on day 12 and clinical signs on day 12 postchallenge. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus ceased shedding on day 9 and median time to resolution of clinical signs was on day 12 postchallenge. M. haemolytica resolved clinical signs 8 days postchallenge. This literature review and descriptive analysis can serve as a resource to assist in designing challenge model studies and potentially aid in estimation of duration of clinical disease and shedding after natural pathogen exposure.},

	abstract = {Reliable detection of Coxiella burnetii is a critical point for the control of the spread of this zoonotic disease (Q fever), ruminants being considered as the main source for human infection as confirmed by the recent human outbreak in the Netherlands since 2007. Considering both public and animal health, providing consolidated prevalence data could be relevant within the decision process of public policy makers or producers organizations. The objective of this study was to conduct a critical review of the literature focused on the prevalence of C. burnetii infection at animal, herd and within-herd levels in cattle, goat and sheep. A qualitative assessment of the 69 selected publications, based on the analysis of the sampling frame and testing procedures, was also performed. While the number of publications increased recently, major methodological issues were still evidenced. These critical issues were related to (i) the absence of description of the sampling strategy and (ii) the lack of sensitivity of the testing procedure. The lack of well designed studies makes not possible to estimate accurately the current prevalence of the infection. Nevertheless, the literature review reported the detection of C. burnetii infection in the all 5 continents with a wide range whatever the species. The apparent prevalence was slightly higher in cattle (20.0\% and 37.7\% of mean apparent prevalence at animal and herd level respectively) than in small ruminants (around 15.0\% and 25\% respectively for animal and herd level in sheep and goat). The present conclusions and the current situation support the persistent need of conducting well designed studies, aiming at estimating the true prevalence of C. burnetii infection in the three main domestic ruminant species.},

	abstract = {Contradictory findings among scientific studies that address a particular issue may impede the conversion of science to management implementation. A systematic review of peer-reviewed studies to generate a single outcome may overcome this problem. The contentious topic of the impact that a megaherbivore such as the savanna elephant have for other species and their environment can benefit from such an approach. After some 68 years, 367 peer-reviewed papers covered the topic and 51 of these papers provided sufficient data to be included in a meta-analysis. We separated the direct impact that elephants had on trees and herbs from the indirect effects on other vertebrates, invertebrates, and soil properties. Elephants have an impact on tree structure and abundance but no overall negative cascading effects for species that share space with them. Primary productivity explained a small amount of variation of elephant impact on vegetation. Elephant numbers (density), study duration, rainfall, tree cover, and the presence of artificial water and fences failed to describe patterns of impact. We conclude that published information do not support the calls made for artificially manipulating elephant numbers to ameliorate elephant impact, and call for the management of space use by elephants to maintain savanna heterogeneity.},

Inadequate reporting of key aspects of experimental design may reduce the impact of studies and could act as a barrier to translation of research findings. Reporting of animal use must be as comprehensive as possible in order to take advantage of every study and every animal used. Animal models are essential to understanding and assessing new chemotherapy candidates for Chagas disease pathology, a widespread parasitic disease with few treatment options currently available. A systematic review was carried out to compare ARRIVE guidelines recommendations with information provided in publications of preclinical studies for new anti-Trypanosoma cruzi compounds. A total of 83 publications were reviewed. Before ARRIVE guidelines, 69\% of publications failed to report any macroenvironment information, compared to 57\% after ARRIVE publication. Similar proportions were observed when evaluating reporting of microenvironmental information (56\% vs. 61\%). Also, before ARRIVE guidelines publication, only 13\% of papers described animal gender, only 18\% specified microbiological status and 13\% reported randomized treatment assignment, among other essential information missing or incomplete. Unfortunately, publication of ARRIVE guidelines did not seem to enhance reporting quality, compared to papers appeared before ARRIVE publication. Our results suggest that there is a strong need for the scientific community to improve animal use description, animal models employed, transparent reporting and experiment design to facilitate its transfer and application to the affected human population. Full compliance with ARRIVE guidelines, or similar animal research reporting guidelines, would be an excellent start in this direction.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of protozoa concentration on methane emission from ruminants. A database was built from 59 publications reporting data from 76 in vivo experiments. The experiments included in the database recorded methane production and rumen protozoa concentration measured on the same groups of animals. Quantitative data such as diet chemical composition, rumen fermentation and microbial parameters, and qualitative information such as methane mitigation strategies were also collected. In the database, 31\% of the experiments reported a concomitant reduction of both protozoa concentration and methane emission (g/kg dry matter intake). Nearly all of these experiments tested lipids as methane mitigation strategies. By contrast, 21\% of the experiments reported a variation in methane emission without changes in protozoa numbers, indicating that methanogenesis is also regulated by other mechanisms not involving protozoa. Experiments that used chemical compounds as an antimethanogenic treatment belonged to this group. The relationship between methane emission and protozoa concentration was studied with a variance-covariance model, with experiment as a fixed effect. The experiments included in the analysis had a within-experiment variation of protozoa concentration higher than 5.3 log10 cells/ml corresponding to the average s.e.m. of the database for this variable. To detect potential interfering factors for the relationship, the influence of several qualitative and quantitative secondary factors was tested. This meta-analysis showed a significant linear relationship between methane emission and protozoa concentration: methane (g/kg dry matter intake)=-30.7+8.14xprotozoa (log10 cells/ml) with 28 experiments (91 treatments), residual mean square error=1.94 and adjusted R 2=0.90. The proportion of butyrate in the rumen positively influenced the least square means of this relationship.},

The aim of the systematic review reported here was to summarize and assess the clinical evidence for or against the effectiveness of acupuncture in veterinary medicine. Systematic searches were conducted on Medline, Embase, Amed, Cinahl, Japana Centra Revuo Medicina and Chikusan Bunken Kensaku. Hand-searches included conference proceedings, bibliographies, and contact with experts and veterinary acupuncture associations. There were no restrictions regarding the language of publication. All controlled clinical trials testing acupuncture in any condition of domestic animals were included. Studies using laboratory animals were excluded. Titles and abstracts of identified articles were read, and hard copies were obtained. Inclusion and exclusion of studies, data extraction, and validation were performed independently by two reviewers. Methodologic quality was evaluated by means of the Jadad score. Fourteen randomized controlled trials and 17 nonrandomized controlled trials met our criteria and were, therefore, included. The methodologic quality of these trials was variable but, on average, was low. For cutaneous pain and diarrhea, encouraging evidence exists that warrants further investigation in rigorous trials. Single studies reported some positive intergroup differences for spinal cord injury, Cushing's syndrome, lung function, hepatitis, and rumen acidosis. These trials require independent replication. On the basis of the findings of this systematic review, there is no compelling evidence to recommend or reject acupuncture for any condition in domestic animals. Some encouraging data do exist that warrant further investigation in independent rigorous trials.},

It has been postulated that there is a dearth of high-level evidence-based research results in veterinary medicine. Also, there is a marked variation in the quality of studies in veterinary and animal science. Post-partum uterine infections occur commonly in dairy cattle and are reported to have a negative impact on reproductive performance. A comprehensive literature search was conducted utilizing online databases revealing a total of 2723 references. After applying specific exclusion criteria, a total of 68 trials were eligible for further analysis. These articles were evaluated utilizing specific parameters listed in an evaluation form such as randomization and the involvement of control groups. The analysis revealed that more than half of the trials (51.5\%) were at least 20 years old. Furthermore, we found that about one third (36.8\%) of all trials were controlled and randomized, while 3 of those (4.4\%) were also blinded. Of those trials which calculated a calving-to-conception interval (n=30), 50\% of the authors claimed an improvement, which was statistically significant in 23.3\% of the cases. We conclude that there is a wide discrepancy between research results investigating the efficacy of PGF(2alpha).},

	abstract = {Acute puerperal metritis (APM) is an acute systemic illness with fever {\textgreater}/=39.5 degrees C and signs of toxemia due to an infection of the uterus occurring within 21 d after parturition. Because of the infectious nature of APM, antibiotics are considered beneficial for its treatment. Each use of an antimicrobial drug, however, is associated with selective pressure for the emergence of resistant bacteria. Hence, there is a significant need to encourage prudent use of antibiotics and alternative therapies to antibiotics. Therefore, the objective of this study was to systematically review the current literature on treatment of APM. A comprehensive and systematic literature search was conducted utilizing the PubMed and CAB Abstracts databases to identify literature focusing on the antibiotic therapy of puerperal metritis in the cow. After application of specific exclusion criteria, 21 publications comprising 23 trials remained for final evaluation. Data extraction revealed that the majority of the studies (n = 19) were attributable to the highest evidence level. Of 21 studies controlled, 11 had an untreated group and 3 a positive control group. The majority of the studies (n = 17) applied ceftiofur for the treatment of APM. Concerning the efficacy of ceftiofur, 7 studies observed clinical improvement, whereas none found improved reproductive performance. Fewer than half of the studies (n = 10) performed a bacteriological examination and only 4 implemented an antibiotic susceptibility test. Also, 3 studies (13.0\%) described a self-cure rate per se. Little attention was given to the issue of bacterial resistance (n = 3), the need for reducing the application of antibiotics (n = 2), or guidelines for prudent use of antibiotics (n = 1). Our findings demonstrate that implementation of bacteriological examinations, sensitivity testing, and determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations, as well as reporting and discussion of critical issues (e.g., self-cure rates, resistance, prudent drug use), were suboptimal. On the other hand, the quality of studies on the treatment of APM was good, as indicated by evidence level 1. Nevertheless, more high-quality research considering self-cure rates is necessary to address critical issues related to APM and crucial to the dairy industry, such as resistance, prudent use of antibiotics, animal welfare, and cost-benefit ratios.},

	abstract = {The objective of the conducted meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy of the treatment of bovine endometritis with PGF2alpha by statistical means. Postpartum uterine infections have a high prevalence and a very negative effect on reproductive performance in dairy cattle. Because of a wide discordance between research results, a meta-analysis of the efficacy of the treatment of bovine endometritis with PGF2alpha was conducted. A comprehensive literature search was performed using online databases to reveal a total of 2,307 references. In addition, 5 articles were retrieved by reviewing citations. After applying specific exclusion criteria and evaluating specific evidence parameters, 5 publications, comprising 6 trials, were eligible for being analyzed by means of meta-analysis. Data for each trial were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis software Review Manager (version 5.1; The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark). Estimated effect sizes of PGF2alpha were calculated on calving to first service and calving to conception interval. Prostaglandin F2alpha treatment of cows with chronic endometritis had a negative effect on both reproductive performance parameters. Heterogeneity was substantial for calving to first service and calving to conception interval [I(2) (measure of variation beyond chance)=100 and 87\%, respectively]; therefore, random-effects models were used. Sensitivity analysis as well as subgroup analysis showed that the performance of randomization was influential in modifying effect size of PGF2alpha treatment. The funnel plot illustrated a publication bias toward smaller studies that reported a prolonged calving to conception interval after a PGF2alpha treatment. We conclude that the investigation of this subject by means of meta-analysis did not reveal an improvement of reproductive performance of cows with endometritis after treatment with PGF2alpha. Furthermore, there is a shortage of comparable high quality studies investigating reproductive performance after PGF2alpha treatment of cows with chronic endometritis.},

Although several published studies have estimated the cure rate of IMI after DCT, variation among studies is great, which makes it difficult to conduct a proper economic evaluation of DCT. The objective of the present meta-analysis of existing peer-reviewed literature was to provide a summary quantification of quarter IMI cure based on DCT. A meta-analysis relative risk (RR) was calculated per intervention and pathogen group when at least 4 studies were available for analysis per comparison from the 22 selected studies, according to the selection criteria. Results of the meta-analysis were examined using publication bias tests. Blanket DCT with a 95\% confidence interval (CI) provided a 1.78 (1.51 to 2.10) times higher calculated cure rate from quarter IMI during the dry period up to 21 d postcalving, compared with no DCT. The RR of cure was similar when treatment was conducted for Streptococcus spp. IMI quarters compared with Staphylococcus spp. IMI quarters. The pooled RR with the 95\% CI were 1.83 (1.48 to 2.35) and 1.65 (1.38 to 1.96), respectively. There was no significant difference between cloxacillin and other DCT products in the cure of quarter IMI during the dry period up to 21 d postcalving. The pooled RR with the 95\% CI was 1.00 (0.92 to 1.09). Similarly, there was no significant difference between cloxacillin and other DCT products in the cure of quarter Staphylococcus spp. IMI. The pooled RR with the 95\% CI was 1.00 (0.96 to 1.06). The pooled RR with the 95\% CI of quarter IMI cure using selective DCT, compared with no DCT, was 1.76 (1.23 to 2.54).},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to estimate the preventive effect of various dry cow management measures against quarter new intramammary infections (IMI) during the dry period up to 21 d postcalving. Moreover, the potential publication bias was assessed in the studies selected for this analysis. The intervention measures were blanket dry cow therapy (BDCT), selective dry cow therapy (SDCT), cloxacillin compared with other dry cow therapy products, and teat sealant. A meta-analysis relative risk (RR) was calculated per intervention and pathogen group when enough studies were available from the 33 selected studies. Results of the meta-analyses were examined using publication bias tests. Blanket dry cow therapy showed significant protection against new IMI caused by Streptococcus spp. [the pooled RR was 0.39 (0.30 to 0.51)] but no protection was observed against coliform new IMI [the pooled RR was 0.95 (0.81 to 1.10)]. After correction for publication bias, it became doubtful whether DCT is protective against new Staphylococcus spp. IMI. Cloxacillin showed similar protection against new quarter IMI compared with other DCT products [the pooled RR was 1.09 (0.94 to 1.25)]. Selective dry cow therapy showed higher protection against new IMI compared with no DCT [the pooled RR was 0.51 (0.30 to 0.86)]. However, BDCT showed more protection when compared with SDCT [the pooled RR was 0.55 (0.37 to 0.80)], but the inference about whether BDCT is superior to SDCT was dependent on whether the selection criteria for SDCT was at the cow or quarter level. Internal teat sealants showed significant protection against new IMI during the dry period [the pooled RR was 0.39 (0.18 to 0.82)]. Publication bias should be taken into account when attempts are made to review literature in a meta-analysis.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the dependence of echocardiographic ratio indices (ERIs) on age, body weight (BW) and breed/study group using individually contributed and published summarized data in dogs. BACKGROUND: ERIs allow for narrow prediction intervals of M-mode echocardiographic measurements in generic adult dogs. Breed and age-specific differences have not been examined systematically using ERI methods. ANIMALS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Individual M-mode measurements were contributed by 15 published investigators from 661 dogs, allowing direct calculation of ERIs and summary statistics for each of these breed/study groups. M-mode ERI summary statistics were estimated from published summaries of 22 additional groups that included 527 adult and 36 growing dogs. Individual two-dimensional (2DE) left atrial (LA) and aortic root (Ao) measurements were contributed from 36 dogs. ERIs were analyzed for dependence on BW, breed/study group and age. RESULTS: The majority of variation among ERIs was due to differences in the breed or study technique with comparatively little dependence on BW. Age dependence of ERIs was seen in the early growth phases of young dogs, but expected values for each ERI became static long before maturity, roughly at 10-12 weeks of age. ERIs derived from individual 2DE LA and Ao measurements showed no significant dependence on BW. CONCLUSIONS: ERIs are well normalized for body size and may be useful for clinical evaluation of individuals, prediction of expected M-mode and 2DE cardiac dimensions, and investigation of age or breed-specific cardiac shape changes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Around 67 million pets are owned by households in the United Kingdom, and an increasing number of these are exotic animals. Approximately a third of pets are purchased through retail outlets or direct from breeders. A wide range of infections can be associated with companion animals. OBJECTIVES: This study uses a systematic literature review to describe the transmission of zoonotic disease in humans associated with a pet shop or other location selling pets (incidents of rabies tracebacks and zoonoses from pet food were excluded). DATA SOURCES: PubMed and EMBASE. RESULTS: Fifty seven separate case reports or incidents were described in the 82 papers that were identified by the systematic review. Summary information on each incident is included in this manuscript. The infections include bacterial, viral and fungal diseases and range in severity from mild to life threatening. Infections associated with birds and rodents were the most commonly reported. Over half of the reports describe incidents in the Americas, and three of these were outbreaks involving more than 50 cases. Many of the incidents identified relate to infections in pet shop employees. LIMITATIONS: This review may have been subject to publication bias, where unusual and unexpected zoonotic infections may be over-represented in peer-reviewed publications. It was also restricted to English-language articles so that pathogens that are more common in non-Western countries, or in more exotic animals not common in Europe and the Americas, may have been under-represented. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: A wide spectrum of zoonotic infections are acquired from pet shops. Salmonellosis and psittacosis were the most commonly documented diseases, however more unusual infections such as tularemia also appeared in the review. Given their potential to spread zoonotic infection, it is important that pet shops act to minimise the risk as far as possible.},

DESIGN: Standardized, systematic evaluation of the literature, categorization of relevant articles according to level of evidence and quality, and development of consensus on conclusions for application of the concepts to clinical practice. SETTING: Academic and referral veterinary medical centers. RESULTS: Databases searched included Medline, CAB abstracts, and Google Scholar. CONCLUSIONS: All 4 standard thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) variables should be universally reported, and the reporting of shear elastic modulus in addition to maximum amplitude (MA) is encouraged. There is insufficient evidence to support universal usage of the coagulation index at this time. The K value and clot formation time are the most variable of the 4 parameters, with alpha angle, MA, and maximum clot firmness generally the least variable. Individual studies should report sufficient data on patients and institutional controls to enable definitions of hypo- and hypercoagulability to be evaluated post-hoc, and it is recommended that all studies specifically report how these conditions were defined. In reporting data relating to fibrinolysis, the TEG variables LY30, LY60, CL30, CL60, and the ROTEM variables LI30, LI60, ML, LOT, and LT should be documented. Studies should report sufficient data on patients and controls to enable definitions of hyper- and hypofibrinolysis to be evaluated post-hoc, and we suggest that standard TEG/ROTEM assays may be unable to detect hypofibrinolysis in companion animals. We recommend that every center establish reference intervals, which are specific to either TEG or ROTEM. These reference intervals should be established using veterinary clinical pathology guidelines, standardized protocols, and a minimum of 40 healthy animals. There are currently insufficient data in companion animals to suggest a utility for Vcurve variables beyond that of standard TEG variables.},

	abstract = {Despite differences in focus, goals, and strategies between conservation biology and animal welfare, both are inextricably linked in many ways, and greater consideration of animal welfare, although important in its own right, also has considerable potential to contribute to conservation success. Nevertheless, animal welfare and animal ethics are not always considered explicitly within conservation practice. We systematically reviewed the recent scientific peer-reviewed and online gray literature on reintroductions of captive-bred and wild-caught animals (mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles) to quantify the occurrence of animal welfare issues. We considered monitoring that could be indicative of the animal's welfare status and supportive management actions that could improve animal welfare (regardless of whether the aim was explicitly animal-welfare orientated). Potential welfare issues (of variable nature and extent) were recorded in 67\% of 199 projects reviewed; the most common were mortality {\textgreater}50\%, dispersal or loss of animals, disease, and human conflict. Most ({\textgreater}70\%) projects monitored survival, 18\% assessed body condition, and 2\% monitored stress levels. Animal welfare, explicitly, was referred to in 6\% of projects. Supportive actions, most commonly use of on-site prerelease pens and provision of supplemental food or water, were implemented in 79\% of projects, although the extent and duration of support varied. Practitioners can address animal-welfare issues in reintroductions by considering the potential implications for individual animals at all stages of the release process using the decision tree presented. We urge practitioners to report potential animal-welfare issues, describe mitigation actions, and evaluate their efficacy to facilitate transparent evaluation of common moral dilemmas and to advance communal strategies for dealing with them. Currently, comparative mortality rates, health risks, postrelease stress, effectiveness of supportive measures, and behavior of individuals warrant further research to improve animal welfare in reintroductions and to increase success of such projects.},

Nevertheless, our knowledge of the impact of climate change on livestock infectious diseases is much less certain. Therefore, the aim of the article is to conduct a systematic review of the literature on the topic utilizing available retrospective data and information. Across a corpus of 175 formal publications, limited empirical evidence was offered to underpin many of the main arguments. The literature reviewed was highly polarized and often inconsistent regarding what the future may hold. Historical explorations were rare. However, identifying past drivers to livestock disease may not fully capture the extent that new and unknown drivers will influence future change. As such, our current predictive capacity is low. We offer a number of recommendations to strengthen this capacity in the coming years. We conclude that our current approach to research on the topic is limiting and unlikely to yield sufficient, actionable evidence to inform future praxis. Therefore, we argue for the creation of a reflexive, knowledge-based system, underpinned by a collective intelligence framework to support the drawing of inferences across the literature.},

Consequently, professionals working in human or in animal health do not always communicate findings related to these events with one another. Using the One Health concept of integration and collaboration among health disciplines, we systematically review the existing literature to discover where harmful cyanobacteria-associated animal illnesses and deaths have served as sentinel events to warn of potential human health risks. We find that illnesses or deaths among livestock, dogs and fish are all potentially useful as sentinel events for the presence of harmful cyanobacteria that may impact human health. We also describe ways to enhance the value of reports of cyanobacteria-associated illnesses and deaths in animals to protect human health. Efficient monitoring of environmental and animal health in a One Health collaborative framework can provide vital warnings of cyanobacteria-associated human health risks.},

Authors from the Collaborative Approach to Meta Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies (CAMARADES) collaboration recently found that these features protect against bias in animal stroke studies. We extended the scope the work from CAMARADES to include investigations of treatments for any condition. METHODS: We conducted an overview of systematic reviews. We searched Medline and Embase for systematic reviews of animal studies testing any intervention (against any control) and we included any disease area and outcome. We included reviews comparing randomized versus not randomized (but otherwise controlled), concealed versus unconcealed treatment allocation, or blinded versus unblinded outcome assessment. RESULTS: Thirty-one systematic reviews met our inclusion criteria: 20 investigated treatments for experimental stroke, 4 reviews investigated treatments for spinal cord diseases, while 1 review each investigated treatments for bone cancer, intracerebral hemorrhage, glioma, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and treatments used in emergency medicine. In our sample 29\% of studies reported randomization, 15\% of studies reported allocation concealment, and 35\% of studies reported blinded outcome assessment. We pooled the results in a meta-analysis, and in our primary analysis found that failure to randomize significantly increased effect sizes, whereas allocation concealment and blinding did not. In our secondary analyses we found that randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding reduced effect sizes, especially where outcomes were subjective. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the need for randomization, allocation concealment, and blind outcome assessment in animal research across a wide range of outcomes and disease areas. Since human studies are often justified based on results from animal studies, our results suggest that unduly biased animal studies should not be allowed to constitute part of the rationale for human trials.},

It identifies, tabulates and classifies relevant published work and was conducted using electronic reference databases (BIDS ISI, BIOSIS, MEDLINE and the CAB Abstracts CD-ROM). A total of 1373 unique references were obtained from 1981 to 2000, of which 914 were written in the English language. A written search protocol was designed to ensure transparency and repeatability. Pilot studies were undertaken to create search terms that minimised bias and ensured relevance. Electronic files of the search terms allow the database to be updated in future. A further 93 references were included from the most recent international conference on lameness giving a total of 1007 English language references. The systematic review process is described, including a method of classifying papers according to their study design and statistical analysis, and it is hoped that other veterinary researchers will conduct similar reviews in their fields. The compiled and classified references are available as a searchable database through the web-sitehttp://cattle-lameness.dhs.org/. The review may be used in several ways; to identify practical interventions to reduce lameness in dairy cows and to use the resultant web-site as the basis of a decision support system for farmers, veterinarians and advisors.},

	abstract = {Crop-raiding is a major source of conflict between people and wildlife globally, impacting local livelihoods and impeding conservation. Conflict mitigation strategies that target problematic wildlife behaviours such as crop-raiding are notoriously difficult to develop for large-bodied, cognitively complex species. Many crop-raiders are generalist feeders. In more ecologically specialised species crop-type selection is not random and evidence-based management requires a good understanding of species' ecology and crop feeding habits. Comprehensive species-wide studies of crop consumption by endangered wildlife are lacking but are important for managing human-wildlife conflict. We conducted a comprehensive literature search of crop feeding records by wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), a ripe-fruit specialist. We assessed quantitatively patterns of crop selection in relation to species-specific feeding behaviour, agricultural exposure, and crop availability. Crop consumption by chimpanzees is widespread in tropical Africa. Chimpanzees were recorded to eat a considerable range of cultivars (51 plant parts from 36 species). Crop part selection reflected a species-typical preference for fruit. Crops widely distributed in chimpanzee range countries were eaten at more sites than sparsely distributed crops. We identified 'high' and 'low' conflict crops according to their attractiveness to chimpanzees, taking account of their importance as cash crops and/or staple foods to people. Most (86\%) high conflict crops were fruits, compared to 13\% of low conflict crops. Some widely farmed cash or staple crops were seldom or never eaten by chimpanzees. Information about which crops are most frequently consumed and which are ignored has enormous potential for aiding on-the-ground stakeholders (i.e. farmers, wildlife managers, and conservation and agricultural extension practitioners) develop sustainable wildlife management schemes for ecologically specialised and protected species in anthropogenic habitats. However, the economic and subsistence needs of local people, and the crop-raiding behaviour of sympatric wildlife, must be considered when assessing suitability of particular crops for conflict prevention and mitigation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically examine the evidence on basic life support (BLS) in veterinary CPR and to determine knowledge gaps. DESIGN: Standardized, systematic evaluation of the literature, categorization of relevant articles according to level of evidence and quality, and development of consensus on conclusions for application of the concepts to clinical practice. Relevant questions were answered on a worksheet template and reviewed by the Reassessment Campaign on Veterinary Resuscitation (RECOVER) BLS domain members, by the RECOVER committee and opened for comments by veterinary professionals for 30 days. SETTING: Academia, referral practice, and general practice. RESULTS: Sixteen worksheets were prepared to evaluate techniques for chest compression and ventilation strategies as well as identification of cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA). Major recommendations arising from this evidence review include performing chest compressions at a rate of at least 100/min at a compression depth of one-third to half the width of the chest with minimal pauses, and early instigation of ventilation at a rate of 8-10 breaths/min in intubated patients, or using a 30:2 compression/ventilation ratio in nonintubated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although veterinary clinical trials are lacking, much of the experimental literature on BLS utilized canine models. The major conclusions from this analysis of the literature are the importance of early identification of CPA, and immediate initiation of BLS in these patients. Many knowledge gaps exist, most importantly in our understanding of the optimal hand placement and technique for chest compressions, warranting coordinated future studies targeted at questions of relevance to differences between veterinary species and humans.},

This study conducted a Bayesian meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of AI vaccines in chickens. We included both inactivated and recombinant fowlpox virus expressing H5 (rFPV-H5) vaccine studies that used specific-pathogen-free chickens where outcomes against the H5N1 or H5N2 AI viruses were measured. Vaccine efficacy was evaluated by protection from mortality, protection from morbidity, reductions in virus isolation from the respiratory tract, and reductions in virus isolation from the cloaca. The efficacies for homologous inactivated vaccines by those four outcomes were 92\% (95\% confidence interval 90\%-95\%), 94\% (91\%-96\%), 54\% (50\%-58\%), and 88\% (84\%-91\%), respectively.

Although those vaccines protect chickens from morbidity and mortality, virus shedding would be an important biosecurity issue for further AI endemic control.},

Six of seven papers indicated a benefit of long-term treatment over short-term treatment in terms of the reduction of clinical signs or lameness; one study showed no benefit. Fourteen papers evaluated safety with calculated experimental (adverse) event rates (EER) between 0 and 0.31, but there was no correlation between study length and EER (rs=-0.109, P=0.793). The balance of evidence for the efficacy of NSAIDs supports longer-term use of these agents for increased clinical effect.

	abstract = {This report aims to present data and expert knowledge on poverty and zoonoses hotspots to inform prioritization of study areas on the transmission of disease in emerging livestock systems in the developing world, where prevention of zoonotic disease might bring greatest benefit to poor people. The first chapter reviews the substantial literature on prioritizing disease and identifies prioritization criteria relevant to this study, namely: burden of human disease; impacts on livestock production and productivity; amenability to agricultural intervention; and, concern because of emergence or severity. This allowed the identification of 24 zoonoses of high importance to poor people, 13 of which were investigated in depth. The next chapter reviews current evidence on poverty and livestock, on livestock systems and their dynamics, and on zoonoses and how they are currently mapped. The map of poor livestock keepers is updated and an additional map based on subnational data is presented. Maps of livestock systems that are changing most rapidly in response to emerging markets are also presented, and vulnerability to climate change is described. The strengths and weaknesses of different maps are noted. The next chapter presents evidence from a systematic review of over 1000 studies on the prevalence of the 13 priority zoonoses in people and animals. It focuses on the endemic zoonoses that impose greatest burden and a 'top 20' list is given of geographical hotspots. Data on zoonoses are also extracted from the WHO Global Burden of Disease and the 'top 20' countries identified. A case study that compares our systematic review with an 'in-country review' focusing on grey literature and literature in a language other than English is included. Some of the challenges of the study and caution in interpreting the results are discussed. The next chapter updates the map of emerging disease events. For the first time, emerging zoonoses are mapped as distinct from other emerging disease events. The last chapter provides maps of regional agroecosystems and summarizes numbers of livestock, people and poor livestock keepers by system as well as the zoonoses context. It also draws some global conclusions from the study.},

Yet, there has been no attempt to summarize the published data on wild terrestrial animals to reveal general trends regarding the effects of pollution on oxidative stress. The main findings of this meta-analysis reveal that, as predicted, there is an overall increase in oxidative stress when exposed to pollution. This is mainly due to a weak overall increase of oxidative damages, although there is some variation across taxa. The reduced form of glutathione (GSH) and its associated enzymes are the most reliable biomarkers. This result is important when choosing biomarkers and when using less-invasive sampling of endangered species, or for longitudinal approaches. To be able to predict future population outcomes, possible treatments, but also evolutionary responses to a changing environment, a greater integration of biotic factors such as temperature, bioavailability of toxic elements, and species-specific responses are needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli O157 (EcO157) infection has been recognized as an important global public health concern. But information on the prevalence of EcO157 in cattle at the global and at the wider geographical levels is limited, if not absent. This is the first meta-analysis to investigate the point prevalence of EcO157 in cattle at the global level and to explore the factors contributing to variation in prevalence estimates. METHODS: Seven electronic databases- CAB Abstracts, PubMed, Biosis Citation Index, Medline, Web of Knowledge, Scirus and Scopus were searched for relevant publications from 1980 to 2012. A random effect meta-analysis model was used to produce the pooled estimates. The potential sources of between study heterogeneity were identified using meta-regression. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 140 studies consisting 220,427 cattle were included in the meta-analysis. The prevalence estimate of EcO157 in cattle at the global level was 5.68\% (95\% CI, 5.16-6.20). The random effects pooled prevalence estimates in Africa, Northern America, Oceania, Europe, Asia and Latin America-Caribbean were 31.20\% (95\% CI, 12.35-50.04), 7.35\% (95\% CI, 6.44-8.26), 6.85\% (95\% CI, 2.41-11.29), 5.15\% (95\% CI, 4.21-6.09), 4.69\% (95\% CI, 3.05-6.33) and 1.65\% (95\% CI, 0.77-2.53), respectively. Between studies heterogeneity was evidenced in most regions. World region (p{\textless}0.001), type of cattle (p{\textless}0.001) and to some extent, specimens (p = 0.074) as well as method of pre-enrichment (p = 0.110), were identified as factors for variation in the prevalence estimates of EcO157 in cattle. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of the organism seems to be higher in the African and Northern American regions. The important factors that might have influence in the estimates of EcO157 are type of cattle and kind of screening specimen. Their roles need to be determined and they should be properly handled in any survey to estimate the true prevalence of EcO157.},

	abstract = {The use of systems for pressure measurement between the rider's body and the back of the horse is a relatively new procedure. The size and transfer of the load inside the horse-pad-saddle-rider system can be assessed in various ways. This paper provides a review of literature published from 1994 to 2010 that discusses using pressure mapping systems for measuring the contact load between the horse and its rider. Literature was obtained using common scientific databases such as Web of Science, SCOPUS and PubMed entering the key words: "horse", "pressure", and "back". The first published studies aimed to verify sensor parameters and to minimize animal- and operator-induced errors. In order to obtain valid and reliable data, it is important to perform pressure measurements under highly standardized conditions. Moreover using properly established guidelines for calibrating and placing sensors is crucial for receiving valid data. Subsequent studies focused on the influence of various types of saddles, pads, blankets and adjustments of saddle fit on the loading of the horse's back. Results of these studies showed that using pressure mapping systems provide a useful evaluation of the load applied to the area of contact between the horse and rider. A properly fitted saddle with a pad can serve as a shock absorber. Literature findings suggest that improving the fit of a saddle by using a saddle pad needs to be individually adapted for each horse and rider. Considering the current status of literature on the use of pressure mapping systems in horseback riding future research should concentrate on using data obtained by biomechanical modelling of contact surfaces, including their interactions; on determining a "normal pattern" of pressure distribution on the equine back; and on finding a way to include individual parameters of the horse and its rider into the overall assessment.},

	abstract = {Historically, serological tests for finfish diseases have been underused when compared with their use in terrestrial animal health. For years the nonspecific immune response in fish was judged to make serology unreliable and inferior to the direct measurement of agent analytes. We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed publications that reported on the development, validation, or application of serological tests for finfish diseases. A total of 168 articles met the screening criteria; most of them were focused on salmonid pathogens (e.g., Aeromonas spp. and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus). Before the 1980s, most publications reported the use of agglutination tests, but our review indicates that enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has more recently become the dominant serological test. The main application of serological tests has been in the assessment of vaccine efficacy, with few applications for surveillance or demonstration of freedom from disease, despite the advantages of serological tests over direct detection at the population level. Nonlethal sampling, low cost, and postinfection persistence of antibodies make serological assays the test of choice in surveillance, especially of valuable broodstock. However, their adoption has been constrained by poor characterization and validation. The number of publications in our review reporting diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of serological tests in finfish was small (n = 7). Foreseeing a wider use of serological tests in the future for diagnostic end purposes, we offer recommendations for mitigating deficiencies in the development and evaluation of serological tests, including optimization, control of nonspecific reactions, informed cutoff points, diagnostic accuracy, and serological baseline studies. Achieving these goals will facilitate greater international recognition of serological testing in programs supporting aquatic animal health. Received March 21, 2016; accepted September 24, 2016.},

The possibility of its clinical use against other invasive mycoses, has aroused the interest of numerous investigators in evaluating its efficacy in different animal models. OBJECTIVES: To critically review the current data on the use of micafungin in the treatment of invasive mycoses in animal models. METHODS: We searched the PubMed/Medline data base (National Library of Medicine) from 2005 to 2008, both inclusive, on the use of micafungin in the experimental treatment of the fungal infection. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Seven, of a total of 18 articles reviewed, were done in animal models of candidiasis and six in animal models of pulmonary or SNC aspergillosis. Similarly to the other echinocandins, caspofungin and anidulafungin, micafungin seems to exert a fungicidal activity against Candida albicans and Candida glabrata and a fungistatic activity against Aspergillus fumigatus. The paradoxical effect observed in lung tissue the experimental caspofungin treatment of aspergillosis has not been seen in the case of micafungin. The available data demonstrate a higher efficacy of micafungin versus fluconazole in the experimental treatment of C. albicans infections caused by strains susceptible in vitro to both drugs. To improve the efficacy of micafungin in the treatment of C. glabrata and A. fumigatus infections, several authors have tested different combined therapies, the combination of micafungin with amphotericin B being that showed the best results.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the extent to which dietary tannin level is related to methane emissions from ruminants. Data from a total of 30 experiments comprising 171 treatments were entered in a database. In vitro batch culture and in vivo measurements were distinguished as experimental approaches. With any approach, methane declined when dietary tannins increased. The in vitro approach predicted the in vivo response quite accurately. However, in vitro, the response followed a quadratic response pattern (R(2) = 0.66; lower response with increasing tannin level), whereas in vivo, this decline was linear (R(2) = 0.29). This indicates that the in vitro batch culture is of limited accuracy for estimating effects at levels {\textgreater}100 g tannin/kg dry matter. The large variation in methane/digestible organic matter (OM) found at low tannin levels may explain contrasting literature reports. Methane reduction with tannins was associated with a reduced apparent digestion of OM, and especially fibre, but methane/apparently digestible OM declined also. The present findings are helpful as they identified an underlying general antimethanogenic effect of tannins across tannin sources and experimental conditions, thus allowing concentrating the search on sources with satisfactory palatability and low adverse effects on animal performance.},

	abstract = {Saponins have been considered as promising natural substances for mitigating methane emissions from ruminants. However, studies reported that addition of saponin-rich sources often arrived at contrasting results, i.e. either it decreased methane or it did not. The aim of the present study was to assess ruminal methane emissions through a meta-analytical approach of integrating related studies from published papers which described various levels of different saponin-rich sources being added to ruminant feed. A database was constructed from published literature reporting the addition of saponin-rich sources at various levels and then monitoring ruminal methane emissions in vitro. Accordingly, levels of saponin-rich source additions as well as different saponin sources were specified in the database. Apart from methane, other related rumen fermentation parameters were also included in the database, i.e. organic matter digestibility, gas production, pH, ammonia concentration, short-chain fatty acid profiles and protozoal count. A total of 23 studies comprised of 89 data points met the inclusion criteria. The data obtained were subsequently subjected to a statistical meta-analysis based on mixed model methodology. Accordingly, different studies were treated as random effects whereas levels of saponin-rich source additions or different saponin sources were considered as fixed effects. Model statistics used were p-value and root mean square error. Results showed that an addition of increasing levels of a saponin-rich source decreased methane emission per unit of substrate incubated as well as per unit of total gas produced (p{\textless}0.05). There was a decrease in acetate proportion (linear pattern; p{\textless}0.001) and an increase in propionate proportion (linear pattern; p{\textless}0.001) with increasing levels of saponin. Log protozoal count decreased (p{\textless}0.05) at higher saponin levels. Comparing between different saponin-rich sources, all saponin sources, i.e. quillaja, tea and yucca saponins produced less methane per unit of total gas than that of control (p{\textless}0.05). Although numerically the order of effectiveness of saponin-rich sources in mitigating methane was yucca {\textgreater} tea {\textgreater} quillaja, statistically they did not differ each other. It can be concluded that methane mitigating properties of saponins in the rumen are level- and source-dependent.},

Of 63 published studies, 16 describing three commercial vaccines fulfilled the criteria for the meta-analysis. Due to few studies with one of the vaccines (n=3), only two vaccines were included. Vaccinated pigs gained an average of 592g (S.E.=15) with Stellamune and 590g (S.E.=15) with Suvaxyne compared to non-vaccinated pigs that gained an average of 569g (S.E.=14)(P{\textless}0.01) when adjusted for age during the study.

	abstract = {Data implicating mucosal cytokines in the pathogenesis of canine inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are limited. The aims of the present study were to report new findings of intestinal cytokine expression in dogs with IBD and to compare these data with previous studies through meta-analysis. Cytokine mRNA abundance in intestinal biopsies collected prospectively was evaluated by using a semiquantitative RT-PCR technique. For meta-analysis, an electronic database search revealed 3 clinical trials, all of which were nonrandomized (type III) case series. Prospective analysis showed that the intestines of healthy dogs and those with IBD express numerous cytokines and that a proinflammatory expression profile is not a feature of small or large-intestinal IBD. The meta-analysis data included 158 dogs characterized as healthy (n = 45), diarrheic nonIBD dogs (n = 6), nonresponders (n = 2), small-intestinal IBD (n = 41), colonic IBD (n = 25), and chronic enteropathy (n = 39). German shepherd dogs were overrepresented in 3 of the 4 studies. Healthy dogs showed mRNA expression for most cytokines including IL2, IL4, IL5, IL10, IL12, IFNgamma, TNFalpha, and TGFbeta. Only IL12 mRNA expression was increased consistently in small-intestinal IBD, whereas IBD colitis lacked consistent patterns of expression. In summary, dogs with IBD fail to express a predominant Th1- or Th2 cytokine bias in inflamed mucosa. Heterogeneity of results among these studies might be explained by numerous factors including the method of mRNA quantification, stage of disease, and demographic differences in study populations.},

	abstract = {Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a major reason for antibiotic prescription in small animal practice. Optimal antibiotic treatment strategies have not been established for veterinary species, especially when considering duration of treatment, which is often considerably longer than for human patients with UTI. The aims of this study were (1) to identify and assess evidence related to the efficacy of antibiotic treatment in canine and feline UTIs; and (2) to compare the efficacy of short ({\textless}5 days) and standard ({\textgreater}/=7 days) duration of antibiotic treatment for canine uncomplicated UTI. An electronic literature search was conducted for publications to 1 May 2014. Fourteen peer-reviewed prospective and controlled studies were retrieved, 10 of which evaluated antibiotic treatment in dogs and four in cats. Of the 14 studies, seven were clinical trials and five of those were randomised controlled trials. Most (12/14) studies were not considered to contribute sufficient evidence to evaluate treatment strategies. There were no clinical studies examining the effect of duration of the same drug. Of the short duration regimens evaluated, the efficacy of 3 day antibiotic therapy with trimethoprim-sulphonamide (females only) or high-dose enrofloxacin in dogs with uncomplicated UTIs was supported by fair evidence, as these treatment strategies were non-inferior to medium duration (10-14 days) therapy with beta-lactam antimicrobials. In conclusion, there is little published evidence relating to antibiotic treatment of UTIs in dogs and cats. Well-designed clinical trials focusing on the duration of treatment are warranted to create evidence-based treatment protocols.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rabies still poses a significant human health problem throughout most of Africa, where the majority of the human cases results from dog bites. Mass dog vaccination is considered to be the most effective method to prevent rabies in humans. Our objective was to systematically review research articles on dog rabies parenteral vaccination coverage in Africa in relation to dog accessibility and vaccination cost recovery arrangement (i.e.free of charge or owner charged). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A systematic literature search was made in the databases of CAB abstracts (EBSCOhost and OvidSP), Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Medline (EBSCOhost and OvidSP) and AJOL (African Journal Online) for peer reviewed articles on 1) rabies control, 2) dog rabies vaccination coverage and 3) dog demography in Africa. Identified articles were subsequently screened and selected using predefined selection criteria like year of publication (viz. {\textgreater}/= 1990), type of study (cross sectional), objective(s) of the study (i.e. vaccination coverage rates, dog demographics and financial arrangements of vaccination costs), language of publication (English) and geographical focus (Africa). The selection process resulted in sixteen peer reviewed articles which were used to review dog demography and dog ownership status, and dog rabies vaccination coverage throughout Africa. The main review findings indicate that 1) the majority (up to 98.1\%) of dogs in African countries are owned (and as such accessible), 2) puppies younger than 3 months of age constitute a considerable proportion (up to 30\%) of the dog population and 3) male dogs are dominating in numbers (up to 3.6 times the female dog population). Dog rabies parenteral vaccination coverage was compared between "free of charge" and "owner charged" vaccination schemes by the technique of Meta-analysis. Results indicate that the rabies vaccination coverage following a free of charge vaccination scheme (68\%) is closer to the World Health Organization recommended coverage rate (70\%) than the achieved coverage rate in owner-charged dog rabies vaccination schemes (18\%). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Most dogs in Africa are owned and accessible for parenteral vaccination against rabies if the campaign is performed "free of charge".},

The study found several examples in which agricultural intensification and/or environmental change were associated with an increased risk of zoonotic disease emergence, driven by the impact of an expanding human population and changing human behavior on the environment. We conclude that the rate of future zoonotic disease emergence or reemergence will be closely linked to the evolution of the agriculture-environment nexus. However, available research inadequately addresses the complexity and interrelatedness of environmental, biological, economic, and social dimensions of zoonotic pathogen emergence, which significantly limits our ability to predict, prevent, and respond to zoonotic disease emergence.},

The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the quality of published literature in canine reproduction concerning the HOS test. Using two distinguished databases, 38 articles were detected and analysed subsequently according to various aspects, for example study design, population, semen sampling and implementation concerning the HOS test. Although there are numerous articles available, the diagnostic value of the HOS test remains ambiguous. Until now, neither a recognized test protocol nor reliable reference values have been defined. Most of the trials evaluated show serious methodological flaws and therefore do not permit drawing reliable conclusions. According to our results, approximately half of the studies (n = 20) included a sample size of five or less animals. None of the studies examined the inter- or intraobserver agreement for the HOS test. Further research is warranted including appropriate statistical methods and a sufficient number of animals to establish a standardized test protocol as well as reliable reference values. Most importantly, it is required to clarify a correlation between the HOS test and the fertilizing capacity to determine the diagnostic value of the HOS test.},

The modified vaccinia ankara virus-expressing antigen 85A (MVA85A) aims to boost BCG immunity. We evaluated the animal evidence supporting the testing of MVA85A in humans. METHODS: Our protocol included in vivo preclinical studies of the MVA85A booster with BCG compared with BCG alone, followed by a TB challenge. We used standard methods for systematic review of animal studies, and summarized mortality, measures of pathology and lung bacterial load. The comprehensive literature search was to September 2014. Two independent investigators assessed eligibility and performed data extraction. We assessed study quality and pooled bacteria load using random effect meta-analysis. FINDINGS: We included eight studies in 192 animals. Three experiments were in mice, two in guinea pigs, two in macaques and one in calves. Overall, study quality was low with no randomization, baseline comparability not described and blinding not reported. For animal death (including euthanasia due to severe morbidity), studies were underpowered, and overall no benefit demonstrated. No difference was shown for lung pathology measured on an ordinal scale or bacterial load. The largest mortality trial carried out in macaques had more deaths in the MVA85A vaccine group, and was published after a trial in South Africa had started recruiting children. CONCLUSIONS: This independent assessment of the animal data does not provide evidence to support efficacy of MVA85A as a BCG booster. More rigorous conduct and reporting of preclinical research are warranted, and we believe the results of studies should be publicly available before embarking on trials in humans, irrespective of the findings.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 'Pubmed' of the United States National Library of Medicine and 'Veterinary Science' of CAB International were searched for references relating sheep to alpha(2)-agonists. The bibliographies of retrieved articles were further scrutinized for pertinent references, and relevant articles were selected manually. RESULTS: Reports on the use of clonidine, xylazine, detomidine, romifidine, medetomidine and dexmedetomidine, MPV-2426 and ST-91 in sheep were found in the literature. Most of the studies described xylazine followed by medetomidine and clonidine. The literature on detomidine and romifidine in sheep was sparse. Reports included pharmacokinetic studies, evaluation of sedative, analgesic, and anaesthetic techniques with or without cardiovascular effects, and experimental investigations of adverse effects (mainly hypoxaemia) including the mechanisms of pulmonary oedema and impaired oxygenation after alpha(2)-agonist administration. CONCLUSIONS: A(2)-agonists are potent and effective analgesics in sheep. In combination with ketamine, they are frequently used for the induction and maintenance of anaesthesia, in this case analgesia is satisfactory. The degree of hypoxaemia which occurs with all commercially available alpha(2)-agonists is highly variable and depends on individual or breed-related factors; the most severe reactions occur after intravenous (IV) injection and during general anaesthesia. Clinical relevance Subclinical respiratory disease is common in sheep. Rapid IV injection of alpha(2)-agonists without supplementary oxygen should be avoided whenever hypoxaemia may be critical.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the unique pathophysiology of sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) and highlight the relevant aspects of the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Clinical Practice Guideline for Acute Kidney Injury that may apply to veterinary patients. DATA SOURCES: Electronic search of MEDLINE database. HUMAN DATA SYNTHESIS: Sepsis-induced AKI is diagnosed in up to 47\% of human ICU patients and is seen as a major public health concern associated with increased mortality and increased progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Consensus criteria for the definition and classification of AKI has allowed for accurate description of the epidemiology of patients with AKI. AKI develops from a complex relationship between the initial insult and activation of inflammation and coagulation. In contrast to the traditional view, clinical and experimental data dispute the role of renal ischemia-reperfusion in the development of sepsis-induced AKI. Renal tubular dysfunction with activation of the tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism appears to be a crucial contributor to sepsis-induced AKI. Furosemide and n-acetylcysteine (NAC) do not appear to be helpful in the treatment of AKI. Hydroxyethyl starches (HES), dopamine, and supraphysiological concentrations of chloride are harmful in patients with AKI. VETERINARY DATA SYNTHESIS: Community and hospital-acquired AKI is a significant factor affecting survival in critical ill patients. Sepsis-induced AKI occurs in 12\% of dogs with abdominal sepsis and is an important contributor to mortality. Early detection of AKI in hospitalized patients currently offers the best opportunity to improve patient outcome. The use of urinary biomarkers to diagnose early AKI should be evaluated in critical care patients. CONCLUSION: Veterinary clinical trials comparing treatment choices with the development of AKI are needed to make evidence-based recommendations for the prevention and treatment of AKI.},

Relevance screening identified 201 relevant studies that were subjected to methodological assessment. Of these studies, 159 were suitable for data extraction, 66 were presented in a number of MAs and 130 were examined in a meta-regression (MR). Fourteen different CE products were identified, 9 of them commercial products, and the most common route of administration was oral gavage (63.7\% of trials). Meta-analyses indicated that a number of CE products reduce Salmonella colonization in broilers, the most effective one being Preempt which was formerly known as CF-3. Five study characteristics (publication year, CE type, CE route, sample origin, and Salmonella serovar administered/recovered) and three methodological soundness characteristics (treatment assignment, intervention and laboratory methods description) were retained as statistically significant (p{\textless}0.05) in the final MR model. The MR analysis indicated that, undefined CE products outperformed all commercial products, except for: Preempt and Broilact((R)). Both were considered comparable to the undefined chicken source CE culture products in effectiveness. The administration of CE through spraying the chicks at the hatchery was determined to be just as effective as the oral gavage treatment, and more practical for farmers to administer. The results of this study could be useful in decision-making concerning the on-farm use of CE products in broiler chickens, and as inputs for risk assessments as the industry pushes for more antibiotic-free alternatives. Out of the various interventions to reduce Salmonella colonization in broilers on-farm, CE was the most studied; its inability to be licenced in certain countries and proof of consistent efficacy remains a barrier.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted using the results of 82 experiments (78 publications, 266 treatments) to investigate the importance of dietary C18 fatty acids (FA) and feeding regimen for milk C18 FA profile and apparent recovery of selected FA relative to intake of these FA or their precursors. Feeding treatments based on lipid-supplemented diets were excluded. Feeding regimens were defined as grazing [including partial and full-time grazing, at dietary concentrate proportions from 0 to 44\% dry matter (DM)], forage-based indoor feeding [{\textgreater}65\% forage of total DM intake (DMI)], and concentrate-based indoor feeding (forage DMI {\textless}/=65\% of DMI). Linoleic acid (LLA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), and total C18 FA proportions in milk fat increased linearly with the respective dietary FA content in all feeding regimens tested. This effect was highest in the forage-based indoor feeding. Slopes were lowest for the grazing regimens, especially regarding ALA and the sum of all C18 FA, whereas the intercepts of the prediction equations of milk ALA and total C18 FA proportions were highest for grazing regimens. This indicates that, in grazing cows, factors other than dietary FA contents determine the C18 FA composition of the milk fat. At equal dietary LLA contents, the type of feeding regimen showed no significant effect on LLA proportion in milk fat. Milk fat proportions of rumenic acid and vaccenic acid were positively related to the sum of dietary ALA and LLA contents. Grazing regimens led to the strongest enrichment of rumenic acid and vaccenic acid in milk fat. The apparent recovery of ALA, LLA, and total C18 FA (secreted, \% of intake), an estimate for transfer efficiency, decreased with increasing dietary content. This relationship followed a nonlinear decay function. When the dietary content of these FA exceeded a certain threshold (about 0.2, 0.8, and 2.8\% of DM for ALA, LLA, and total C18 FA, respectively) the recovery in milk remained constant at about 5, 10, and 82\% of the ingested ALA, LLA, and total C18 FA, respectively. At dietary proportions below 0.01\% ALA and 1.5\% total C18 FA of DM, their apparent recovery in milk fat exceeded 100\%. In conclusion, a general inverse relationship between dietary C18 FA and the corresponding apparent recovery in milk fat seems to exist. Within this frame, the effect of different types of feeding regimens on the eventual milk C18 FA profile varies. Among them, grazing pasture appears to provide the most variable properties.},

	abstract = {The present study aimed at investigating the effects of essential oils and their bioactive compounds (EOBC) on rumen fermentation in vivo as well as animal performance and feed efficiency in different ruminant species, using a meta-analysis approach. Ruminant species were classified into 3 classes consisting of beef cattle, dairy cattle, and small ruminants. Two datasets (i.e., rumen fermentation and animal performance) were constructed, according to the available dependent variables within each animal class, from 28 publications (34 experiments) comprising a total of 97 dietary treatments. In addition, changes in rumen fermentation parameters relative to controls (i.e., no EOBC supplementation) of all animal classes were computed. Data were statistically analyzed within each animal class to evaluate the EOBC dose effect, taking into account variations of other variables across experiments (e.g., diet, feeding duration). The dose effect of EOBC on relative changes in fermentation parameters were analyzed across all animal classes. The primary results were that EOBC at doses {\textless}0.75 g/kg diet DM acted as a potential methane inhibitor in the rumen as a result of decreased acetate to propionate ratio. These responses were more pronounced in beef cattle (methane, P = 0.001; acetate to propionate ratio, P = 0.005) than in small ruminants (methane, P = 0.068; acetate to propionate ratio, P = 0.056) and in dairy cattle (P {\textgreater} 0.05), respectively. The analysis of relative changes in rumen fermentation variables suggests that EOBC affected protozoa numbers (P {\textless} 0.001) but only high doses ({\textgreater}0.20 g/kg DM) of EOBC had an inhibitory effect on this variable whereas lower doses promoted the number. For performance data, because numbers of observations in beef cattle and small ruminants were small, only those of dairy cattle (DMI, milk yield and milk composition, and feed efficiency) were analyzed. The results revealed no effect of EOBC dose on most parameters, except increased milk protein percentage (P{\textless} 0.001) and content (P = 0.006). It appears that EOBC supplementation can enhance rumen fermentation in such a way (i.e., decreased acetate to propionate ratio) that may favor beef production. High doses of EOBC do not necessarily modify rumen fermentation or improve animal performance and feed efficiency. Furthermore, additional attention should be paid to diet composition and supplementation period when evaluating the effects of EOBC in ruminants.},

	abstract = {Although it is assumed that most mammals experience growth plate closure and cessation of bone growth soon after sexual maturity, bone growth in rats continues throughout their lifespan. The rat was compared to other laboratory animals to assess differences in the duration of bone growth and its relationship to age at sexual maturity and lifespan. We reviewed the literature from 1966 to March 1999 by searching MEDLINE and other databases. Growth closure times and age at sexual maturity were retrieved for the mouse, rabbit, dog, cat, sheep, cow, horse, nonhuman primates, and human. For all species, we calculated the ratios of: 1) age at growth plate closure to lifespan, 2) age at growth plate closure to age at sexual maturity, and 3) age at sexual maturity to average lifespan. The ratio of age at physis closure to the average lifespan was large for the rat (22 to 35) and showed some overlap with that of humans (17 to 25); this ratio was comparatively small in all other nonhuman species (range, 4 to 17). This finding indicates that bone growth continues in the rat for a greater proportion of their lifespan than does that in other species. The ratio of age at physis closure to age at sexual maturity was larger for the rat (5 to 6) than that for other species, indicating that bone growth continues much longer after sexual maturity in rats than in other animals. The ratio of age at sexual maturity to average lifespan was largest for humans and nonhuman primates (13 to 14), indicating the increased time to reach puberty versus that in other species. These differences are important for studies in which animal models are used in research involving bone growth.},

	abstract = {As the elderly population grows, so do the clinical and socioeconomic burdens of non-healing cutaneous wounds, the majority of which are seen among persons over 60 years of age. Studies of how aging effects cutaneous wound healing have become a priority. Human studies will always be the gold standard, but studies have ethical and practical hurdles. Choosing an animal model is dictated by costs and animal lifespan that preclude large animal use. Here we review the current literature on how aging effects cutaneous wound healing in small animal models and, when possible, to compare healing across studies. Using a literature search of MEDLINE/PubMed databases, studies were limited to those that utilized full-thickness wounds and compared the wound-healing parameters of wound closure, re-epithelialization, granulation tissue fill, and tensile strength between young and aged cohorts. Overall, wound closure, re-epithelialization, and granulation tissue fill were delayed or decreased with aging across different strains of mice and rats. Aging in mice was associated with lower tensile strength early in the wound healing process, but greater tensile strength later in the wound healing process. Similarly, aging in rats was associated with lower tensile strength early in the wound healing process, but no significant tensile strength difference between young and old rats later in healing wounds. From studies in New Zealand White rabbits, we found that re-epithelialization and granulation tissue fill were delayed or decreased overall with aging. While similarities and differences in key wound healing parameters were noted between different strains and species, the comparability across the studies was highly questionable, highlighted by wide variability in experimental design and reporting. In future studies, standardized experimental design and reporting would help to establish comparable study groups, and advance the overall knowledge base, facilitating the translatability of animal data to the human clinical condition.

A database of articles addressing the experimental infection with Coccidia in broilers was developed. These publications must present results of animal performance (weight gain, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio). The database was composed by 69 publications, totalling around 44 thousand animals. Meta-analysis followed three sequential analyses: graphical, correlation, and variance-covariance. The feed intake of the groups challenged by E. acervulina and E. tenella did not differ (P{\textgreater}0.05) to the control group. However, the feed intake in groups challenged by E. maxima and Pool showed an increase of 8\% and 5\% (P{\textless}0.05) in relation to the control group. Challenged groups presented a decrease (P{\textless}0.05) in weight gain compared with control groups. All challenged groups showed a reduction in weight gain, even when there was no reduction (P{\textless}0.05) in feed intake (adjustment through variance-covariance analysis). The feed intake variation in broilers infected with E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. tenella, or Pool showed a quadratic (P{\textless}0.05) influence over the variation in weight gain. In relation to the isolated effects, the challenges have an impact of less than 1\% over the variance in feed intake and weight gain. However, the magnitude of the effects varied with Eimeria species, animal age, sex, and genetic line. In general the age effect is superior to the challenge effect, showing that age at the challenge is important to determine the impact of Eimeria infection.},

METHODS: Databases (Pubmed, Veterinary Information Network) were searched for clinical studies on nonsurgical management of HD in dogs. The evidence in each study was reviewed and assigned a score (I-IV) based on previously reported levels of evidence. RESULTS: Fourteen articles were identified that met the inclusion criteria, including 3 Level IV, 4 Level III, and 7 Level II studies. Methods of nonsurgical management reviewed included: activity restrictions, weight management, acupuncture, modulation of joint disease by polysulfated glycosaminoglycans, mesenchymal stem cell therapy, and extra corporeal shock wave therapy. CONCLUSION: Weight management is an effective and important component of managing dogs with HD and associated osteoarthritis. Techniques that modulate the progression of joint disease may also be beneficial for treating dogs with HD. Further studies are needed to investigate other methods of managing HD such as hydrotherapy and physical rehabilitation.},

A meta-analytical approach was used to weigh the sample size used in each experiment, and account for the random effect of each as well as unequal variance among studies. A total of 20 recently conducted experiments with 354 treatments, each including one control (i.e., no BC supplementation), fulfilled the criteria for inclusion. Doses of BC supplementation varied from 0.03 to 500 mg/g dry matter (DM) of incubated diet. Contents of crude protein (CP) and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) of the incubated diets (DM basis) ranged from 139 to 189 g/kg and 160 to 420 g/kg, respectively. Results indicate that supplementation of BC linearly decreased (137.4 versus 116.5 mmol/L; P{\textless}0.05) concentration of total volatile fatty acids (VFA) and proportion of acetate (P{\textless}0.05). Also, the concentration of ammonia in the in vitro rumen fluid was lower with BC supplementation (22.9 versus 15.6 mg/dL; P{\textless}0.05). Analysis by backward elimination correlation analysis revealed that inclusion of the chemical composition of the incubated diet into the model with BC supplementation improved the accuracy of estimation of responses of fermentation variables. Thus, higher NDF and CP contents of the substrate and higher BC dosage were associated with lower concentrations of total VFA (r²=0.54), whereas both lower CP contents of the substrate and BC supplementation lowered the concentration of ammonia (r²=0.32). This analysis showed negative associations between BC supplementation and in vitro disappearance of DM and NDF, and positive correlations with dietary NDF content. In contrast, higher BC inclusion and lowering NDF content in the diet was accompanied with decreased in vitro CH₄ formation (r²=0.21). Results indicate that BC supplementation and chemical composition of the incubated diet are determining factors which impact responses of in vitro ruminal fermentation and degradation.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis investigation based on literature data was conducted to estimate the effect size of nutritional and animal factors on phosphorus (P) excretion in feces and concentrations of P in milk. Two data sets were created for statistical analysis: One to derive prediction equations for P in feces (25 studies; 130 treatments) and another for P in milk (19 studies; 94 treatments). Prediction equations were derived using mixed model regression analysis with a random effect for study, and equations were evaluated based on values for Bayesian information criterion (BIC), root mean square prediction error (RMSPE), and concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) statistics. In terms of RMSPE and CCC values, fecal P excretion was best predicted by P intake, where P in feces (g/d) = -3.8(+/-3.45) + 0.64(+/-0.038) x P intake (g/d) (RMSPE: 18.3\%, CCC: 0.869). However, significant effects of crude protein [g/kg of dry matter (DM)], neutral detergent fiber (g/kg of DM), and milk yield (kg/d) on fecal P excretion were also found. Despite a lack of improvement in terms of RMSPE and CCC values, these parameters may still explain part of the variation in fecal P excretion. For milk P, expressed as a fraction of P intake, the following equation had the highest CCC and the lowest RMSPE value: P in milk as a fraction of P intake (g/g) = 0.42(+/-0.065) + 0.23(+/-0.018) x feed efficiency (i.e., fat- and protein-corrected milk yield/dry matter intake) – 0.11(+/-0.0199) x P in feed (g/kg of DM) (RMSPE: 19.7\%; CCC: 0.761). Equations derived to predict fecal P as a fraction of P intake (g/g) or milk P content (g/kg) could not adequately explain the observed variation and did not perform well in terms of RMSPE and CCC values. Examination of the residuals showed that P balance was a seemingly confounding factor in some of the models. The results presented here can be used to estimate P in feces and milk based on commonly measured dietary and milk variables, but could also be used to guide development of mechanistic models on P metabolism in lactating dairy cattle. Factors to consider in future research and modeling efforts regarding efficiency of P use include the effects of dietary neutral detergent fiber, crude protein, starch, variation in P content of milk, and effects of P resorption from bone and body tissues during early lactation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Histopathology has initially been and is still used to diagnose infectious, degenerative or neoplastic diseases in humans or animals. In addition to qualitative diagnoses semiquantitative scoring of a lesion`s magnitude on an ordinal scale is a commonly demanded task for histopathologists. Multiparametric, semiquantitative scoring systems for mouse models histopathology are a common approach to handle these questions and to include histopathologic information in biomedical research. RESULTS: Inclusion criteria for scoring systems were a first description of a multiparametric, semiquantiative scoring systems which comprehensibly describe an approach to evaluate morphologic lesion. A comprehensive literature search using these criteria identified 153 originally designed semiquantitative scoring systems for the analysis of morphologic changes in mouse models covering almost all organs systems and a wide variety of disease models. Of these, colitis, experimental autoimmune encephalitis, lupus nephritis and collagen induced osteoarthritis colitis were the disease models with the largest number of different scoring systems. Closer analysis of the identified scoring systems revealed a lack of a rationale for the selection of the scoring parameters or a correlation between scoring parameter value and the magnitude of the clinical symptoms in most studies. CONCLUSION: Although a decision for a particular scoring system is clearly dependent on the respective scientific question this review gives an overview on currently available systems and may therefore allow for a better choice for the respective project.},

	abstract = {Clinicians and pathologists are sporadically asked by owners whether the taking of tumour biopsies may affect the behaviour of the tumour, including its potential to metastasise. Unfortunately, systematic studies on this subject are unavailable in veterinary medicine, and the aim of this study was to estimate the risk of adverse effects of biopsy taking on tumour progression in animals. A systematic review of veterinary and human case reports and clinical studies as well as experimental animal models of biopsy-induced tumour metastasis was undertaken. There were only two veterinary case reports of needle tract metastases (NTM) following the taking of needle biopsies from urogenital and pulmonary tumours. Seventeen experimental studies found a high incidence of NTM but only a rat osteosarcoma and a hamster squamous carcinoma model showed an increased incidence of distant or regional metastases after incision or excision biopsy. In human medicine, the occurrence of NTM has been reported after the taking of biopsies from mesotheliomas (15\%), melanomas (11\%) and gall bladder tumours (11\%), liver metastases of colon carcinomas (4\%) and mammary carcinomas (4\%) but an incidence of only {\textless}1\% for all other tumours. Circulating tumour cells increased immediately after the taking of biopsies from human squamous cell, prostate, breast and hepatocellular carcinomas. Although no increased risk of biopsy-induced distant metastasis has been reported for any type of tumour, this is inconclusive due to a lack of non-biopsied control groups in human studies. Reports of biopsy-induced metastasis in animal tumours indicate that the taking of transcutaneous biopsies from urogenital tumours may be associated with a risk of NTM. However, there is no evidence of a general increase in risk of distant metastases in any tumour type in people or animals. The overall risk therefore appears to be negligible when compared to the valuable information obtained from biopsies in veterinary practice.},

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of publications on E. coli as calf pathogens and the role of calves as reservoir have not been done so far. We reviewed studies between 1951 and 2013 reporting the presence of virulence associated factors (VAFs) in calf E. coli and extracted the following information: year(s) and country of sampling, animal number, health status, isolate number, VAF prevalence, serotypes, diagnostic methods, and biological assays. The prevalence of VAFs or E. coli pathotypes was compared between healthy and diarrheic animals and was analyzed for time courses. Together, 106 papers with 25,982 E. coli isolates from 27 countries tested for VAFs were included. F5, F17, and F41 fimbriae and heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) – VAFs of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) were significantly associated with calf diarrhea. On the contrary, ETEC VAF F4 fimbriae and heat-labile enterotoxin as well as enteropathogenic (EPEC), Shiga toxin-producing (STEC), and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) were not associated with diarrhea. The prevalence increased overtime for ST-positive isolates, but decreased for F5- and STEC-positive isolates. Our study provides useful information about the history of scientific investigations performed in this domain so far, and helps to define etiological agents of calf disease, and to evaluate calves as reservoir hosts for human pathogenic E. coli.},

	abstract = {The thermotolerant species of Campylobacter have become very important in public health, particularly as agents of infectious diarrhoea in human beings. Though the mechanism by which they cause disease is yet to be fully explained, they have been recognized as the leading cause of bacterial enteritis in both developed and developing countries. The organisms colonize different animal species without causing any symptoms of disease; and humans acquire infections through contact with or consumption of contaminated meat especially raw/undercooked poultry meat. The growing trend of antibiotic resistant Campylobacter isolates continues to pose significant public health challenges. In this review we present the available information generated in Tanzania about Campylobacter infections in humans and animals. We conducted a structured literature search of PUBMED and ScienceDirect electronic databases and identified 15 articles. Studies on humans reported Campylobacter infections in both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects; with higher prevalence in children under the age of five years. Studies on animals found colonization of both domestic and wild species. Among isolates, some demonstrated antimicrobial resistance. The available information for both human and animal Campylobacteriosis in the country is sparse. It however provides an insight of the bacteriological and epidemiological aspects of Campylobacter infections in the country and eventually creates more awareness on the need to develop control strategies. Since the organism is zoonotic its control strategies should adopt the "One Health" approach involving collaborative efforts from veterinary and human medicine.},

However, there is significant debate about how to evaluate the methodology and potential biases of the animal studies. There is no agreed upon approach, and a systematic evaluation of current best practices is lacking. OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review to identify and evaluate instruments for assessing risk of bias and/or other methodological criteria of animal studies. METHOD: We searched Medline (January 1966 – November 2011) to identify all relevant articles. We extracted data on risk of bias criteria (e.g. randomization, blinding, allocation concealment) and other study design features included in each assessment instrument. DISCUSSION: Thirty distinct instruments were identified with the total number of assessed risk of bias, methodological, and/or reporting criteria ranging from 2 to 25. The most common criteria assessed were randomization (25/30, 83\%), investigator blinding (23/30, 77\%) and sample size calculation (18/30, 60\%). In general, authors failed to empirically justify why these or other criteria were included. Nearly all (28/30, 93\%) instruments have not been rigorously tested for validity or reliability. CONCLUSION: Our review highlights a number of risk of bias assessment criteria that have been empirically tested for animal research including randomization, concealment of allocation, blinding and accounting for all animals. Additionally, there is a need for empirically testing additional methodological criteria, and assessing the validity and reliability of a standard risk of bias assessment instrument.},

	abstract = {The aim of this investigation was, through a meta-analysis, to review the published literature concerning the effect of PCV2 vaccination on the average daily weight gain (ADG) and on the mortality rate in pigs from weaning to slaughter. The review was restricted to studies investigating the effect of vaccines against PCV2 published from 2006 to 2008, identified using computerised literature databases. Only studies that met the following criteria were included: commercial vaccines were used, pigs or pens were assigned randomly to vaccination versus control groups in herds naturally infected with PCV2, and vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs were housed together. Furthermore, it was a requirement that sample size, age at vaccination, and production period were stated. The levels of ADG and mortality rate had to be comparable to those seen in modern intensive swine production. In total, 107 studies were identified; 70 were excluded because they did not fulfil the inclusion criteria and 13 were identical to results published elsewhere. A significant effect of PCV2 vaccination on ADG was found for pigs in all production phases. The largest increase in ADG was found for finishing pigs (41.5g) and nursery-finishing pigs (33.6g) with only 10.6g increase in the nursery pigs. Mortality rate was significantly reduced for finishing pigs (4.4\%) and nursery-finishing pigs (5.4\%), but not for nursery pigs (0.25\%). Herds negative for PRRS had a significantly larger increase in ADG compared to herds positive for PRRS. The PRRS status had no effect on mortality rate.},

	abstract = {Companion-animal relinquishment is a worldwide phenomenon that leaves companion animals homeless. Knowing why humans make the decision to end their relationship with a companion-animal can help in our understanding of this complex societal issue and can help to develop preventive strategies. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to summarize reasons why dogs are surrendered, and determine if certain study characteristics were associated with the reported proportions of reasons for surrender. Articles investigating one or more reasons for dog surrender were selected from the references of a published scoping review. Two reviewers assessed the titles and abstracts of these articles, identifying 39 relevant articles. From these, 21 articles were further excluded because of ineligible study design, insufficient data available for calculating a proportion, or no data available for dogs. Data were extracted from 18 articles and meta-analysis was conducted on articles investigating reasons for dog surrender to a shelter (n=9) or dog surrender for euthanasia (n=5). Three studies were excluded from meta-analysis because they were duplicate populations. Other reasons for excluding studies from meta-analysis were, (1) the study only investigated reasons for dog re-relinquishment (n=2) and (2) the study sample size was {\textless}10 (n=1). Two articles investigated reasons for both dog surrender to a shelter and dog surrender for euthanasia. Results of meta-analysis found owner health/illness as a reason for dog surrender to a shelter had an overall estimate of 4.6\% (95\% CI: 4.1\%, 5.2\%). For all other identified reasons for surrender there was significant variation in methodology among studies preventing further meta-analysis. Univariable meta-regression was conducted to explore sources of variation among these studies. Country was identified as a significant source of variation (p{\textless}0.01) among studies reporting behavioural problems as a reason for dog surrender for euthanasia. The overall estimate for studies from Australia was 10\% (95\% CI: 8.0\%, 12.0\%; I2=15.5\%), compared to 16\% (95\% CI: 15.0\%, 18.0\%; I2=20.2\%) for studies from other countries.

Peer-reviewed studies reporting treatment of predominantly chondrodystrophic dogs with disc extrusion with loss of ambulation with either hemilaminectomy or conservative treatment (rest, analgesics and anti-inflammatories) were evaluated in a systematic review of the literature. Generally, the level of evidence available was low with no controlled studies and only case series available. In the meta-analysis, there was a clear trend to a greater proportion of dogs recovering and returning faster to ambulation for dogs treated with hemilaminectomy than for conservatively treated dogs. The mean proportions that recovered for neurological grades 3, 4 and 5 were 93, 93 and 61\% for those treated with hemilaminectomy, and 79, 62 and 10\% for those treated conservatively (Grade 3 – non-ambulatory paraparetic dogs; grade 4 – paraplegic dogs with intact deep pain perception; grade 5 – paraplegic dogs without intact deep pain perception). Due to the use of case series, these results represent between-study comparisons, thereby increasing the risk of selection bias and other biases.

	abstract = {Although in dairy cows the mammary gland (MG) is the major net user of essential AA (EAA) supply, milk protein synthesis from absorbed EAA is not a straightforward process. Early studies identified 2 groups of EAA based on different pattern of mammary utilization: group 1 [Met, Phe (+Tyr), Trp], where MG uptake was similar to secretion in milk protein, and group 2 (Arg, Ile, Leu, Lys, Thr, and Val), where uptake exceeded milk protein output. This review examines the validity of this classification under variable protein supply through a meta-analysis, with the outcomes then explained with studies in which the fates of individual EAA were monitored using isotope approaches. For the meta-analysis, the Fick principle, based on stoichiometric transfer of Phe+Tyr uptake to milk protein, was used to estimate mammary plasma flow across all studies. This approach was judged acceptable because doubling Phe supply did not result in mammary oxidation of Phe+Tyr and either limited or no contribution of peptides to Phe and Tyr mammary supply could be detected. The AA content of proteins synthesized by the MG was estimated from milk protein composition, and the uptake-to-output ratio (U:O) for individual AA was re-calculated based on these assumptions. Analysis of individual samples by isotopic dilution resulted in reduced variance compared with analysis on pooled samples performed with an AA analyzer. Globally, the U:O of His and Met is maintained close to unity under variable protein supply. The group 2 AA could be subdivided. First, the U:O for group "2v" AA (Ile, Leu, Val, and Lys) is greater than 1 and varied with protein supply. Accordingly, the increased U:O of Leu, induced by duodenal casein infusion, led to extra-mammary Leu oxidation. Decreasing Lys supply decreased Lys U:O and the associated transfer of N to non-EAA, mainly to Glx, Asx, Ser, and Ala. Second, the U:O of group "2nv" AA, Arg and Thr, does not vary with protein supply. The Arg U:O averages 2.5, whereas the Thr U:O, albeit averaging 1.2, does not differ from unity. Excess of both these AA is probably directed toward the synthesis of non-EAA rather than energy supply. Overall, the ability of the MG to use excess EAA-N supply offers alternative sources of N and C for energy provision, lactose synthesis and non-EAA synthesis. The latter function spares dietary non-EAA for other necessary processes, such as gluconeogenesis and energy supply, in other tissues to support lactation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bovine cysticercosis in Europe has been known for centuries but the data showing the occurrence of this zoonosis are scarce. The aim of this paper is to review and present the current knowledge on bovine cysticercosis in Europe. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of studies published between 1990 and November 2014. Qualitative and quantitative data on prevalence, risk factors, burden and interventions were extracted and analysed. RESULTS: Reports on prevalence were available for 23 European countries, mostly from western and central Europe; for a few of these only data before 1990 were available. Prevalence based on meat inspection was generally low (below 6.2 \% in 95 \% of the records) and varied between and within countries. Serology and detailed meat inspection provided a higher prevalence range (0.41-14 \%). Only few studies analysing risk factors were identified. Reported factors related to access to pastures and risky waters, dairy production and uncontrolled human defecation in the proximity of the farm among others. Only one estimate of the economic impact of the disease could be identified. Recommended interventions were focused on increasing diagnostic tests sensitivity or the application of risk based surveillance strategies. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of complete and updated data on most countries, especially in eastern Europe. Further risk factor studies might be needed together with estimates on the burden of the disease in all European countries. Risk-based interventions are being encouraged but current data are limited to guide this approach.},

Little research has documented the structure and effectiveness of such initiatives. This systematic review aimed to assess current published research pertaining to accessible health care, community-based veterinary medicine, and the use of community medicine in teaching programs. The review was an in-depth literature search identifying 51 publications relevant to the importance, benefits, drawbacks, and use of low-price and community clinics in underserved communities. These articles identified commonly discussed barriers to care that may prevent underserved clientele from seeking veterinary care. Five barriers were identified including the cost of veterinary care, accessibility of care, problems with or lack of veterinarian-client communication, culture/language, and lack of client education. The review also identified a need for additional research regarding evidence of effectiveness and efficiency in community medicine initiatives.},

Thirty-four original, peer-reviewed publications were identified for inclusion. Six molecular epidemiology studies supported the transfer of resistance via whole bacterium transmission (WBT), which was best characterized among poultry in the Netherlands. Thirteen molecular epidemiology studies supported transmission of resistance via mobile genetic elements, which demonstrated greater diversity of geography and host FPA. Seventeen molecular epidemiology studies did not support WBT and two did not support mobile genetic element-mediated transmission. Four observational epidemiology studies were consistent with zoonotic transmission. Overall, there is evidence that a proportion of human extraintestinal ESCR-EC infections originate from FPAs. Poultry, in particular, is probably a source, but the quantitative and geographical extent of the problem is unclear and requires further investigation.},

	abstract = {Studies used to evaluate effects of dietary intervention on fertility may be subject to confounding because modification of one nutritional input requires a change in at least one other input. Meta-analytical modeling allows examination of a main intervention for a series of studies, but also an examination of a series of related effects through use of meta-regression. Effects of dietary crude protein (CP) on fertility were examined using this approach. We obtained 21 studies containing 32 comparisons that had pregnancy or conception data and met the eligibility criteria for meta-analysis of randomized controlled experiments providing information on diets used. Publications that contained data on prospective, randomized controlled experiments examining effects of dietary CP, either concentrations or degradability, or effects of a specific feed ingredient intervention on fertility were identified. Details on dietary formulation and diet intake were extracted from the publications, as were measures of urea in blood or plasma. Estimated fixed and random effects relative risks showed that risk of conception was lower in cows fed higher CP or more degradable CP diets (fixed effect (Mantel-Haenszel Relative Risk)=0.91 (95\% CI 0.84-0.98); \_P\_=0.019). This effect was homogenous (\_I\_²=0) and not influenced by difference in blood urea N, duration of intervention, breed, parity, milk production or type of diet delivery. Significant associations among CP components of the diet and carbohydrate fractions supported the hypothesized potential for confounding, but only the amount of soluble CP eaten was a significant meta-regression covariate that reduced risk of conception. There was no evidence that the significant reduction in fiber or non-fiber carbohydrate (NFC) fractions of the diets associated with increased concentration of CP, soluble CP or rumen degradable fractions or soyabean products content of the diet influenced conception rates. Results support findings of experiments showing that increased intake of soluble CP reduced conception rates, and provides strong evidence that increased concentrations of CP or increased degradability of CP, within the ranges evaluated in the studies contributing to this meta-analysis, reduce the risk of conception in lactating dairy cattle.},

	abstract = {Data from 137 published trials involving 2,545 calvings were analyzed using random effects normal logistic regression models to identify risk factors for clinical hypocalcemia in dairy cows. The aim of the study was to examine which form, if any, of the dietary cation anion difference (DCAD) equation provided the best estimate of milk fever risk and to clarify roles of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus concentrations of prepartum diets in the pathogenesis of milk fever. Two statistically equivalent and biologically plausible models were developed that predict incidence of milk fever. These models were validated using data from 37 trials excluded from the original data used to generate the models; missing variables were replaced with mean values from the analyzed data. The preferred models differed slightly; Model 1 included prepartum DCAD, and Model 2 included prepartum dietary concentrations of potassium and sulfur alone, but not sodium and chloride. Other factors, included in both models were prepartum dietary concentrations of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus; days exposed to the prepartum diet; and breed. Jersey cows were at 2.25 times higher risk of milk fever than Holstein cows in Model 1. The results support the DCAD theory of greater risk of milk fever with higher prepartum dietary DCAD (odds ratio = 1.015). The only DCAD equation supported in statistical analyses was (Na(+) + K(+)) – (Cl(-) + S(2-)). This finding highlights the difference between developing equations to predict DCAD and those to predict milk fever. The results support a hypothesis of a quadratic role for Ca in the pathogenesis of milk fever (model 1, odds ratio = 0.131; Model 2, odds ratio = 0.115). Milk fever risk was highest with a prepartum dietary concentration of 1.35\% calcium. Increasing prepartum dietary magnesium concentrations had the largest effect on decreasing incidence of milk fever in both Model 1 (odds ratio = 0.006) and Model 2 (odds ratio = 0.001). Increasing dietary phosphorus concentrations prepartum increased the risk of milk fever (Model 1, odds ratio = 6.376; Model 2, odds ratio = 9.872). The models presented provide the basis for the formulation of diets to reduce the risk of milk fever and strongly support the need to evaluate macro mineral nutrition apart from DCAD of the diet.},

	abstract = {Objectives of this study were to critically review randomized controlled trials, evaluate the effectiveness of supplementation with biotin on milk yield and composition and hoof health in lactating dairy cows, explore sources of heterogeneity among studies, and evaluate publication bias. Quantitative assessments can increase the statistical power with which we study the effect of treatments, such as biotin, on outcomes. A total of 9 papers, with 6 production and 3 hoof health studies, met the eligibility criteria for meta-analysis. Eight studies evaluated various hoof lesions in biotin-supplemented cows that did not meet the inclusion criteria. Eleven comparisons were made of milk production responses to biotin treatment. Data extracted included the number of cows in control and treatment groups, measures of variance of responses (standard error or standard deviation) and P-values. Other data obtained included the duration of treatment before and after calving, parity, breed of cow, type and dose of biotin, delivery method of supplementation, and types of diets. Biotin increased milk production by 1.29 kg per head per day (95\% confidence interval=0.35 to 2.18 kg) with no evidence of heterogeneity (I(2)=0.0\%). Treatment did not affect milk fat or protein percentages, and a trend to increase fat and protein yields was observed. Milk production and composition results were not influenced by duration of treatment before calving, parity, or diet type. Assessment of biotin supplementation on hoof health indicated that more studies had improved rather than negative or neutral outcomes. The effect of biotin treatment on milk production was relatively large and the effects on fat and protein yields, although not significant, were consistent in direction and magnitude with the milk response. The hoof health responses to biotin should encourage further studies to more effectively define the nature of these responses using consistent criteria for examination of hoof conditions and lameness.},

We conducted a comprehensive literature search and study assessment using PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Scirus, and CAB and identification of other studies from reference lists in papers and searches. Searches were based on the key words: zilpaterol, zilmax, ractopamine, optaflexx, cattle and beef. Studies from theses obtained were included. Data were extracted from more than 50 comparisons for both agents and analysed using meta-analysis and meta-regression. Both agents markedly increased weight gain, hot carcase weight and longissimus muscle area and increased the efficiency of gain:feed. These effects were particularly large for ZH, however, fat thickness was decreased by ZH, but not RAC. Zilpaterol also markedly increased WBSF by 1.2 standard deviations and more than 0.8 kg, while RAC increased WBSF by 0.43 standard deviations and 0.2 kg. There is evidence in the ZH studies, in particular, of profound re-partitioning of nutrients from fat to protein depots.

	abstract = {This review has a focus on understandings of horn structure, the digital fat pad and associations between ruminal acidosis and lameness. While there is an abundance of basic studies, particularly those examining putative mechanisms influencing risk of lameness and observational field studies, there are relatively few randomised controlled intervention studies. Consequently, the strength of the evidence for some interventions is not high. While there is evidence that increased grain feeding and increased ratios of non-fibre carbohydrates to neutral detergent fibre are associated with increased lameness, evidence for starch effects, per se, on laminitis is limited. There is strong evidence that fructans and glucose increase lactic acid production and laminitis. There is a need for more studies on the role of protein and risk of lameness. Histamine, endotoxin and lactic acid are either present in feed or generated in the rumen; can be absorbed; and have caused laminitis when injected. These provide potential links between ruminal acidosis and laminitis, but may not be the sole agents involved, and there are risks that these agents and other vasoactive agents pose that may be influenced by gut lesions. The important role of lipids in hoof wall integrity and in the digital hoof pad support understandings that trace elements and vitamins involved in pathways that control and limit oxidative damage may be important to hoof health. Further, associations between digital fat pad depth and body condition score suggest that dietary precursors for fats including preformed lipids in the diet and those derived from short chained fats may influence lameness. There is evidence that biotin reduces the risk of lameness, but there is a need for more consistent studies to identify which forms of lameness are reduced. Monensin and organic trace element complexes have reduced lameness in some studies, but the results are not consistently significant and more studies are needed to evaluate responses, especially effects on specific hoof conditions. The well-established effects of mineral nutrition on bone health were briefly examined, as were the effects of toxins. There is considerable scope for well-designed studies to evaluate the complex interactions among nutrients and the various forms of lameness.},

We conducted a systematic review of literature data linking water salinity and prevalence of the infection during the continental phase of Anguilla anguilla and A. rostrata. Overall, we showed a significant negative relationship across all sites (r[sub:S]=-0.42, n=77). In order to limit the effect of confounding factors (e.g. variable latitudes and parasite introduction dates), we performed a meta-analysis on the correlation coefficients calculated from data within studies (restricted period and area) and revealed a stronger negative relationship (r⁻=-0.75, n=13). Finally, using our long-term monitoring in a French Mediterranean lagoon, we documented a step decrease in both parasite prevalence and induced swimbladder pathologies in response to increased salinity values. Salinity effects manifested with an apparent threshold value around 15 per mil and are readily appreciable in young-of-the-year eels. To date, managing around water salinity parameters remains one of the best options to control the ever-expanding infection (both in aquaculture and in the wild) and to improve the quality of future spawners en route to the Sargasso Sea.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Risk of mortality in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI) in cats and dogs remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the incidence of mortality in cats and dogs with AKI based on etiology (i.e. infectious versus non-infectious; receiving dialysis versus conservative treatment). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and LILACS were searched up to July 2016. Articles were deemed eligible if they were case series studies evaluating the incidence of all-cause mortality in cats and dogs with AKI, regardless of etiology or the nature of treatment. RESULTS: Eighteen case series involving 1,201animalsproved eligible. The pooled proportions for overall mortality were: cats53.1\% [95\% CI 0.475, 0.586; I2 = 11,9\%, p = 0.3352]; dogs 45.0\% [95\% CI 0.33, 0.58; I2 = 91.5\%, P {\textless} 0.0001]. A non-significant increase in overall mortality risk was found among dialysed animals relative to those managed with conservative treatment, independent of animal type and the etiology of their AKI. The pooled proportions for overall mortality according to etiology, regardless of treatment type, were: AKI due infectious etiology for cats and dogs, 19.2\% [95\% CI 0.134, 0.258; I2 = 37.7\%, P = 0.0982]; AKI due non-infectious etiology for cats and dogs, 59.9\% [95\% CI 0.532, 0.663; I2 = 51.0\%, P = 0.0211]. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest higher rates of overall mortality in cats and dogs with AKI due to non-infectious etiologies relative to infectious etiologies, and showed non-significant differences in terms of higher rates associated with dialysis compared to conservative management. Further investigations regarding optimal time to initiate dialysis and the development of clinical models to prognosticate the course of disease and guide optimal treatment initiation for less severe cases of AKI in cats and dogs is warranted.},

	abstract = {A recent shortage of prepackaged heparinized saline (HS) syringes has led to the question of whether or not normal saline (NS) can be used to both flush and lock IV catheters in large animal medicine (LAM). Moreover, several known medication incompatibilities exist with IV heparin administration. This is of particular concern in veterinary medicine where limited to no compatibility data exists between "veterinary only" (non-Food and Drug Administration approved) medications and heparin. Most of the literature on this subject is in human medicine where flushing of peripheral IV lines (PIVL) is done safely and effectively with NS. The jugular lines inserted in LAM have characteristics that are more similar to PIVLs versus most central venous access devices used in human patients. In addition, LAM catheters are of larger diameter than those typically used in human medicine thereby reducing the risk of occlusion. Based on the data evaluated, flushing and locking all LAM catheters with of NS is a reasonable alternative method for maintaining IV patency and eliminating problems associated with medication-related incompatibilities or shortages of prepackaged HS syringes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Trypanosomosis is a haemoprotozoan disease, mostly transmitted by the tsetse fly (Glossina spp.), it causes severe disease in humans and animals in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The disease results in loss of livestock and agricultural productivity with severe socio-economic impacts. In Ethiopia, bovine trypanosomosis is widely distributed in western and south-western parts of the country. It is estimated that some 10 to 14 million heads of cattle in Ethiopia are exposed to the risk of trypanosomosis. METHODS: This study describes the prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis in Ethiopia through a meta-analysis. A comprehensive search was conducted on PubMed and non-PubMed indexed articles were also incorporated based on expert suggestion. Eligible studies were selected by using inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pooled prevalence was estimated by random effect model. Publication bias and the variation in prevalence estimates attributed to heterogeneity were also assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies with relevant prevalence data were identified and included in the analysis. The apparent prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis varied from 1.38 to 17.15 \%. The pooled estimate of bovine trypanosomosis prevalence across studies for the entire period was 8.12 \% (95 \% CI: 6.88; 9.35), ranging from 10.27 \% (95 \% CI: 7.34; 13.20) in the late 1990s and early 2000s, to 6.81 \% (95 \% CI: 5.00; 8.62) after 2010. Sub-analysis by region revealed wide variations in prevalence. The highest estimated regional prevalence was 13.30 \% (95 \% CI: 7.73; 18.88) in Benishangul Gumuz Regional state. A high degree of heterogeneity was observed in most pooled estimates and even after sub-group analysis. The visual inspection of the funnel plot and the Egger's regression asymmetry coefficient [b = 2.18] (95 \% CI = -1.09, 5.46; p {\textgreater} 0.05) did not suggest the presence of publication bias. T. congolense and T. vivax were reported to be the predominant causative agents. From the total positive animals, 45.5 and 44.3 \% of the infections are accounted to T. congolense and T. vivax, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The meta-analysis showed a significant reduction in prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis in recent years, but the reduction is not to the lowest necessary level. Since T. vivax is reported to be one of the most important trypanosome species involved, efforts should also be made to control the mechanical transmission by biting flies.},

	abstract = {The objective of the present study was to optimizing the dietary forage NDF (FNDF) and rumen degradable starch (RDS) content and ratios by using the meta-analysis in dairy cows. We collected 39 peered review manuscripts, which were related to FNDF or RDS content on rumen health and milk performance in dairy cows. In this study, we adopted FNDF to RDS ratio (CBI[sub:R]) or their intake difference (CBI[sub:D]) as carbohydrate balance indexes (CBI), and evaluated their regression relationship to the ruminal pH, fermentation characteristics, milk fat and feed efficiency. The results revealed that the CBI[sub:R] and CBI[sub:D] showed strong linear or quadratic correlation with the dependent variables. Dietary CBI[sub:R] and CBI[sub:D] above 1. 28 or 1.09 kg.d⁻¹ could minimize the risk of subacute ruminal acidosis, respectively. To obtain appropriate feed efficiency ({\textgreater}=1.5), milk fat ({\textgreater}=3.5\%) and acetate to propionate ratio (2.2:1-3:1) in dairy cows, the CBI[sub:D] and CBI[sub:R] should be set in the range of -0.42-0.99 kg.d⁻¹ and 0.93-1.30, respectively. In this study, the appropriate CBI[sub:D] and CBI[sub:R] ranges were calculated based on meta-analysis, the CBI[sub:D] and CBI[sub:R] can reflect the change of rumen health and performance of dairy cow.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is becoming a serious epidemic worldwide. Recently, studies have shown that people in contact with livestock may have a greater chance of MRSA carriage. We aimed to establish the prevalence of MRSA among people in contact with livestock and review the factors influencing MRSA carriage. METHODS: We systematically examined published epidemiologic studies on MRSA prevalence in people in contact with livestock using Pubmed, Medline, Embase, Ovid, and the Cochrane Library. Prevalence estimates were pooled using a random-effects model. Study heterogeneity was assessed using Q statistics and quantified with I2 statistics. RESULTS: Thirty-three eligible studies were included in this systematic review. Prevalence of MRSA ranged from 0.0\%-85.8\%. The pooled prevalence estimate of MRSA was 14.2\% (95\% confidence interval, 9.1\%-20.1\%) for people in contact with livestock. Substantial heterogeneity in eligible studies was noted (chi2 = 1,025; P {\textless} .001; I2 = 96.9\%). Subgroup analysis showed the prevalence of MRSA was high in people from Europe (15.9\%), farmers (18.2\%), and by longitudinal study design (38.9\%). Animal contact and intensity of animal contact were associated with increased risk of MRSA carriage. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that there may be transmission of MRSA between animals and humans.},

	abstract = {During the last 17 years, considerable advancements have been achieved in the production of pigs, transgenic and non-transgenic, by methods of somatic cell nuclear transfer, in vitro fertilisation, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, microinjection and sperm-mediated gene transfer by artificial insemination. Therefore, a review of the overall efficiency for the developmental competence of embryos produced by these in vitro methods would be useful in order to obtain a more thorough overview of this growing area with respect to its development and present status. In this review a meta-analysis was used to analyse data collected from all published articles with a focus on zygotes and embryos for transfer, pregnancy, full-term development and piglets born. It was generally concluded that an increasing level of in vitro manipulation of porcine embryos decreased the overall efficiency for production of piglets. The techniques of nuclear transfer have been developed markedly through the increasing number of studies performed, and the results have become more stable. Prolonged in vitro culture period did not lead to any negative effect on nuclear transfer embryos after their transfer and it resulted in a similar or even higher litter size. More complete information is needed in future scientific articles about these in vitro manipulation techniques to establish a more solid basis for the evaluation of their status and to reveal and further investigate any eventual problems.},

A total of 53 studies that measured GHG emissions from swine operations were included in the analyses. Results showed that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) approaches were effective in estimating the overall CH4 and N2O emission levels from swine operations, but the variation of the measured emissions is not adequately captured. An overestimation by the IPCC approaches for CH4 emissions was observed for swine buildings with pit systems in European studies and the average percentage relative difference (PRD) between the measured and the IPCC values is -21.1\%. The observed CH4 emissions from lagoons were lower than the IPCC estimated values and the average PRD is -33.9\%. In North American studies the observed N2O emission factors for swine buildings with pit systems were significantly lower than the IPCC default values, while in European studies they were significantly higher than the IPCC default values. The measured CH4 and N2O emissions were significantly affected by stage of production (P = 0.05 and {\textless} 0.01, respectively) and geographic regions (P = 0.04 and 0.02, respectively). The IPCC approaches were effective in simulating the effect of temperature on CH4 emissions from outdoor slurry storage facilities, while they could overestimate CH4 emissions from lagoons at low temperatures. The CH4 emissions from pits inside swine buildings were not significantly affected by average ambient temperatures. A positive relationship between diet CP content and CH4 emissions was confirmed in the meta-analysis. The obtained knowledge can be helpful in efforts to improve estimation of GHG emissions from swine operations.},

Data from abattoirs could provide benchmarks for welfare indicators at a national level, as well as demonstrating how these change over time. Additionally, feedback could be provided to farmers and regulatory authorities to help improve welfare and identify high or low standards for quality assurance or risk-based inspections. A systematic review of the scientific literature was conducted, which identified 48 animal-based indicators of sheep welfare that were categorised by the Five Freedoms. Their validity as measures of welfare and feasibility for use in abattoirs were evaluated as potential measures of prior sheep welfare on the farm of origin, at market, or during transportation to the abattoir. A total of 19 indicators were considered valid, of which nine were considered theoretically feasible for assessing sheep welfare at abattoirs; these were body cleanliness, carcass bruising, diarrhoea, skin lesions, skin irritation, castration, ear notching, tail docking and animals recorded as 'obviously sick'. Further investigation of these indicators is required to test their reliability and repeatability in abattoirs. Novel welfare indicators are needed to assess short-term hunger and thirst, prior normal behaviour and long-term fear and distress.},

The feed system, confined and do not confined, were superior to the greasing system. The Continental \_Bos taurus\_ genotypes presented bigger AOL values, British \_Bos taurus\_ presented bigger EGC values, and \_Bos indicus\_ presented intermediate values.

	abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of body condition score (BCS) at parturition and at first AI, and of body condition change during the early lactation period on the variables pregnancy rate at first AI and number of days open in dairy cattle. Inclusion criteria for the publications were: comparison of at least two groups of animals of different categories of BCS or change (independent variables) and consideration of pregnancy rate at first AI or number of days open (dependent variables). Fifteen papers were selected and 23 excluded. Data corresponding to 7733 cows from 11 studies described in 10 papers were included in the analysis of pregnancy rate at first AI, and those derived from 4529 cows from 11 studies described in 10 papers were used to analyze effects on the number of days open. Analyses were stratified according to study design and milk production characteristics. We defined low, intermediate and high categories of BCS for values lower than 2.5, from 2.5 to 3.5, or higher than 3.5, respectively. The categories of body condition change were increase (gain in score), slight loss (0-0.5 point loss), moderate loss (0.6-1 point loss), and severe loss (over 1 unit loss). Intermediate body condition at parturition and at first AI, and a slight loss during the early lactation period were used as reference categories. The effects of body condition on the variable pregnancy rate at first AI were highly heterogeneous, while all the studies considering the number of days open presented homogeneous results. A clear association between body condition category and pregnancy rate at first AI was detected only when the effect of a low score at parturition was analyzed: pregnancy rate at first AI significantly decreased by about 10\% in cows delivering in poor condition. Animals with a high BCS at parturition showed a significant reduction in the number of days open of 5.8 or 11.7 when compared with animals with an intermediate or low body condition, respectively. In animals in the high body condition category at first AI, the variable days open showed a significant drop of 11.9 or 24.1, compared to animals in the intermediate or low categories, respectively. A severe loss in score during early lactation was related to a significant (10.6) increase in the number of days open, while a slight or moderate body condition change, either loss or gain in score, was not significantly related to the variable days open. We found that the number of days open was a good indicator of the effects of BCS or change in score on reproductive performance in dairy cattle. The variable pregnancy rate at first AI, however, yielded heterogeneous results among studies.},

	abstract = {Animal welfare has become an important subject of public, economic and political concern, leading to the need to validate indicators that are feasible to use at abattoirs. A systematic review was carried out, which identified 72 cattle welfare indicators (CWI) that were classified into four categories (physiological, morphometric, behavioral and meat quality). Their validity and feasibility for use in abattoirs were evaluated as potential measures of cattle welfare during transportation to the abattoir and at the abattoir itself. Several highly valid indicators were identified that are useful to assess welfare at abattoirs, including body condition score, human-animal interactions, vocalizations, falling, carcass bruising, and meat pH. In addition, some intermediate valid indicators are useful and should be investigated further. Information along the food chain could be used systematically to provide a basis for a more-risk-based meat inspection. An integrated system based on the use of key indicators defined for each inspection step with the setting of alarm thresholds could be implemented.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic threats, such as collisions with man-made structures, vehicles, poisoning and predation by domestic pets, combine to kill billions of wildlife annually. Free-ranging domestic cats have been introduced globally and have contributed to multiple wildlife extinctions on islands. The magnitude of mortality they cause in mainland areas remains speculative, with large-scale estimates based on non-systematic analyses and little consideration of scientific data. Here we conduct a systematic review and quantitatively estimate mortality caused by cats in the United States. We estimate that free-ranging domestic cats kill 1.4-3.7 billion birds and 6.9-20.7 billion mammals annually. Un-owned cats, as opposed to owned pets, cause the majority of this mortality. Our findings suggest that free-ranging cats cause substantially greater wildlife mortality than previously thought and are likely the single greatest source of anthropogenic mortality for US birds and mammals. Scientifically sound conservation and policy intervention is needed to reduce this impact.},

	abstract = {Based on results of cell studies and animal experiments, clinical trials with Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) were performed, which finally did not demonstrate a beneficial effect on outcome of wound healing. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the evidence from cell studies and animal experiments with respect to wound healing was unequivocally in favour of LLLT, which would imply that these models might be adequate to predict treatment response in patients, or that the data of cell studies and animal experiments were inconclusive, which would mean that the clinical trials were based on insufficient evidence. We performed a systematic review of cell studies and animal experiment with LLLT on wound healing. Manuscripts were identified by searching Medline, Embase, and SPIE (the International Society for Optical Engineering). We assessed whether studies showed a beneficial effect of active treatment or not. The effect size was expressed in standardised mean difference [(SMD) the mean outcome measure of the treatment group minus the mean outcome measure of the control group, divided by the pooled standard deviation of these measurements]. In-depth analyses were performed on (1) studies in which inflicted wounds on animals were irradiated and evaluated; (2) studies with primary outcome measures on dimensions with direct reference to wound healing (ranging from acceleration of wound closure to epithelialisation, but excluding surrogate dimensions with regard to wound healing; in this case: tensile strength); (3) animal studies with 'true controls'; (4) studies in which animals functioned as their 'own controls' and (5) studies with the highest methodological quality score. The 36 included studies contained 49 outcome parameters of which 30 reported a positive effect of laser irradiation and 19 did not. Eleven studies presented exact data about the effect of active treatment and controls. The pooled effect size (SMD) over 22 outcome measures of these studies was – 1.05 (95\% Cl: – 1.67 to – 0.43) in favour of LLLT. Methodological quality of the studies was poor. In-depth analysis of studies showed no significant pooled effect size in studies with highest methodological quality scores [0.06 (95\% CI:- 0.42 to 0.53)]. Summarising the data of cell studies and animal experiments, reviewed in this manuscript, these studies failed to show unequivocal evidence to substantiate the decision for trials with LLLT in a large number of patients. In fact, there were no differences between the results of these experiments and clinical studies. Remarkably, we found that (almost from the introduction on) animal experiments and clinical studies that address the biological effects of LLLT on wound healing, ran simultaneously, rather than in sequence. We conclude that this type of phototherapy should not be considered a valuable (adjuvant) treatment for this selected, generally therapy-refractory condition in humans.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that the widespread use of neonicotinoid insecticides threatens bees, but research on this topic has been surrounded by controversy. In order to synthesize which research approaches have been used to examine the effect of neonicotinoids on bees and to identify knowledge gaps, we systematically reviewed research on this subject that was available on the Web of Science and PubMed in June 2015. Most of the 216 primary research studies were conducted in Europe or North America (82\%), involved the neonicotinoid imidacloprid (78\%), and concerned the western honey bee Apis mellifera (75\%). Thus, little seems to be known about neonicotinoids and bees in areas outside Europe and North America. Furthermore, because there is considerable variation in ecological traits among bee taxa, studies on honey bees are not likely to fully predict impacts of neonicotinoids on other species. Studies on crops were dominated by seed-treated maize, oilseed rape (canola) and sunflower, whereas less is known about potential side effects on bees from the use of other application methods on insect pollinated fruit and vegetable crops, or on lawns and ornamental plants. Laboratory approaches were most common, and we suggest that their capability to infer real-world consequences are improved when combined with information from field studies about realistic exposures to neonicotinoids. Studies using field approaches often examined only bee exposure to neonicotinoids and more field studies are needed that measure impacts of exposure. Most studies measured effects on individual bees. We suggest that effects on the individual bee should be linked to both mechanisms at the sub-individual level and also to the consequences for the colony and wider bee populations. As bees are increasingly facing multiple interacting pressures future research needs to clarify the role of neonicotinoids in relative to other drivers of bee declines.},

	issn = {1361-6137},
	doi = {10.1002/14651858.CD012818.pub2},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adequate nutrients early in life promote cognitive development and are critical for proper growth and functioning. The effect of individual nutrients consumed through food is often not the same as consuming the same nutrients in supplementary form due to 'food synergy', the biological and chemical interrelations that occur between nutrients. Animal-source foods, such as eggs, meat, fish, and dairy, are energy dense and contain multiple micronutrients and essential fatty acids with high bioavailability. The benefits of animal-source foods may include higher food synergy relative to fortified foods as well as decreasing dependence on external suppliers of fortified foods. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of animal-source foods compared to any other feeding interventions or no intervention in improving growth and developmental outcomes in children aged 6 to 59 months. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, 18 other databases, and three trials registers up to August 2018. We also contacted authors and known experts in the field for assistance in identifying ongoing or unpublished data, and searched the reference lists of included studies and reviews, and websites of relevant organizations, for other studies that may not have been captured by our electronic searches. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials and quasi-randomized controlled trials of any duration, where children between 5 months and 59 months (6 years) of age were provided with an animal-source food (e.g. consumption of milk, meat, or eggs), prepared with any cooking method, compared with any intervention or no intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility using prespecified criteria, extracted data, assessed risk of bias, and graded the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: Study characteristicsWe included 6 studies that analyzed data from 3036 children aged 5 to 50 months. The studies were conducted in China, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, Guatemala, Pakistan, the USA, and Zambia, and lasted between 5 and 12 months. Three studies were funded, in part, by government entities; one study was supported by a nonprofit organization. Two studies did not report a funding source.Three studies compared the effects of feeding an animal-source food with a fortified (iron or iron and zinc), or unfortified cereal; two used a control group with no intervention; one compared a meat-based diet to a dairy-based diet. The types of animal-source foods tested included yogurt, eggs, cheese, lyophilized (freeze-dried) beef product, ground and frozen pork, puréed and jarred beef with gravy or pork, and powdered whey protein.We judged four studies to be at unclear risk of bias overall; three studies because they were funded by an industry with a plausible interest in the outcome of the intervention; and one study because there was insufficient information to assess five of the seven bias 'Risk of bias' domains. We judged two of the six studies to be at high risk of bias overall; one study because there was significant baseline imbalance in length-for-age z scores (LAZ) between groups and evidence of selective reporting; the other study because there there was both a significant baseline imbalance in LAZ and weight-for-age z scores (WAZ) between groups, and a large-scale social media campaign that may have influenced care received at home in the control group.Key resultsAnimal-source foods versus cereal-based foods or no interventionFive studies (2972 children) measured change in linear growth with either height-for-age z scores (HAZ) or LAZ. Three studies (592 children) reported a significant increase in HAZ and LAZ in the intervention group compared to the control group. Two studies (2380 children) reported a decline in LAZ in both groups. In one study (1062 children) there was no difference between the groups in the rate of decline; in the other (1318 children) the decrease in LAZ was significantly smaller in the intervention group.Five studies (2972 children) measured weight gain using WAZ. Three studies (592 children) reported a significant increase in WAZ in the intervention group compared to the control group. In two studies (2380 children), WAZ decreased in both groups. In one of these studies (1318 children), the decrease in the intervention group was significantly smaller than in the control group. In the other study (1062 children), there was no difference between the groups.Three studies (1612 children) reported impacts on all-cause morbidity, but metrics were inconsistent between studies. One study with yogurt (402 children) reported a significant reduction in duration and incidence of diarrhea and upper respiratory infections in the intervention group. One study with eggs (148 children) reported a significant increase in the incidence of diarrhea in the intervention group, but this may have been due to cultural associations with eggs and gastrointestional problems. There were no other significant differences in fever, respiratory infections, or skin conditions between groups. The third study (1062 children) found no differences between intervention and control groups across morbidity measures.No studies reported data on anemia.Meat-based diet versus dairy-based dietOne study (64 children) measured change in LAZ and WAZ in infants fed either a meat-based diet or dairy-based diet. There was a significant increase in LAZ among infants consuming the meat-based diet and a significant decrease in LAZ among infants consuming a dairy-based diet. WAZ increased in both groups, with no significant difference between groups.The study did not assess all-cause morbidity or anemia.Quality of the evidenceWe rated the quality of the evidence as very low overall due to baseline imbalances between intervention and control groups, high heterogeneity in meta-analysis, and imprecision due to wide confidence intervals and inconsistent direction of effects. We have little confidence in the results; further research is likely to change the estimate of magnitude and direction of treatment effect. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Given the limited quality of the evidence, we are uncertain of the effects of the provision of animal-source food versus cereal products or no intervention on the growth or development of children. More adequately powered trials with deliberately selected animal-source foods are needed.},

	abstract = {Bovine trypanosomiasis is a disease of cattle. In sub-Saharan Africa, the disease mean prevalence estimates are unknown in most endemic countries. We therefore performed a meta-analysis with the aim of estimating national mean prevalence of bovine trypanosomiasis in endemic countries across sub-Saharan Africa. Relevant articles reporting bovine trypanosomiasis prevalence were retrieved through systematic literature search and scanning of articles reference-lists. Eligibility criteria included that articles reported sample size, prevalence, and diagnostic technique adopted. Overall, data from 180 eligible articles from 19 countries satisfied the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of prevalence data based on the random-effects model resulted in an overall mean prevalence of 15.10\% (95\% CI: 13.22-17.08). National prevalence estimates were generally high except those of Benin and Senegal where estimates ranked below 10.00\%. Significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 98.75\%. p = {\textless}0.0001) was noted between studies, and univariate meta-regression analysis identified choice of diagnostic method being major contributor to observed heterogeneity (R(2) = 36.37\%); while country of study (R(2) = 9.57\%) and sample size (R(2) = 3.47\%) had marginal effect on heterogeneity. In spite of past and ongoing control activities, bovine trypanosomiasis remains highly prevalent in most endemic sub-Saharan African countries. Nevertheless, dearth of epidemiological data in some countries and the use of less sensitive diagnostic tools limit reliable estimation of the disease prevalence. Therefore, there is the need to intensify efforts in aspects of surveillance and increased application of molecular diagnostic tool(s) across endemic locations as this would raise the chances of achieving a near-accurate estimate of the disease prevalence which is the first step to attempting eradication.},

	abstract = {The appraisal of the disease burden of African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) in some livestock at country level could invite a re-evaluation of trypanosomiasis-control strategy. This study thus estimates small ruminant and porcine trypanosomiasis prevalence in sub-Saharan African countries. It also describes Trypanosoma species prevalence in small ruminants and pigs and attempts identification of factors explaining between-study variations in prevalence. Articles reporting animal trypanosomiasis prevalence in sheep, goats, and pigs in countries within sub-Saharan Africa were retrieved from different databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, and African Journal Online) and reference lists of relevant literatures. A total of 85 articles from 13 countries published between 1986 and 2018 were included in the analysis. Overall random-effects meta-analytic mean prevalence estimates were: 7.67\% (95\% CI: 5.22-10.49), 5.84\% (95\% CI: 3.81-8.23), and 19.46\% (95\% CI: 14.61-24.80) respectively, for sheep, goats, and pigs with substantial heterogeneity (I(2) = {\textgreater}95.00\%. p {\textless} 0.0001) noted between studies. Ovine, caprine, and porcine prevalence were highest in Tanzania (91.67\%. 95\% CI: 76.50-99.84), Equatorial Guinea (27\%. 95\% CI: 0-81.09), and Cameroon (47\%. 95\% CI: 29.67-66.06), respectively. Trypanosoma brucei s. l., T. vivax, and T. congolense were the most prevalent in the livestock. Trypanosoma brucei subspecies (T. b. gambiense and T. b. rhodesiense) occurred in all three livestock being mostly prevalent in pigs. Country of study was a significant predictor of trypanosomiasis prevalence in each livestock in addition to time and sample size for caprine hosts, diagnostic technique for both caprine and ovine hosts, and sample size for porcine hosts. The pattern of animal trypanosomiasis prevalence in the studied livestock reflects their susceptibility to trypanosomal infections and tsetse fly host feeding preferences. In conclusion, sheep, goats, and especially pigs are reservoirs of human infective trypanosomes in sub-Saharan Africa; consequently, their inclusion in sleeping sickness control programmes could enhance the goal of the disease elimination.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since Muybridge's 'horse in motion', researchers in the equine movement analysis field continue to improve objective analysis and performance monitoring while ensuring representative data capture. However, subjective evaluation remains the primary method of equine gait analysis in the applied setting, despite evidence highlighting the unreliability of this approach. OBJECTIVES: To map research trends, limitations and opportunities across the diverse equine gait analysis literature. STUDY DESIGN: Joanna Briggs Institute and Cochrane systematic scoping review. METHODS: Search terms were chosen based on the 'PICO' framework and included keywords such as: Equine, Gait, Kinematics and Analysis. Studies were excluded based on predetermined criteria by two independent researchers. Data were extracted from 510 articles from 1978 to 2018. RESULTS: Insights derived from movement analysis appear to be driven by tool availability. Observational research (42.9\%) was the most popular study design. Use of wearable technology as a primary research tool is established within the field, accounting for 13.5\% of studies. Analysis of limitations identified 17.8\% of studies citing challenges to the transferability of research results. Restricted sample size appears to be an underlying contributor to many of the limitations identified. In terms of research opportunities, advances in intervention studies were called for (10.4\% of studies) in the following three areas; clinical, rehabilitative exercise and performance/training. MAIN LIMITATIONS: This review was confined to research in the English language. CONCLUSIONS: Standardised research reporting may alleviate sample size issues by facilitating data pooling, database creation and meta-analyses. Large holistic data collections and application frameworks based on wearable technologies are not reflected in the current equine gait analysis literature and thus represent an interesting opportunity for this field. Progress and lessons learned from the human field of movement analysis can be useful in supporting this potential development.},

We aimed to assess whether the newly created models reproduce the full spectrum of human COVID-19. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, as well as BioRxiv and MedRxiv preprint servers for original research published in English from January 1 to May 20, 2020. We used the search terms (COVID-19) OR (SARS-CoV-2) AND (animal models), (hamsters), (nonhuman primates), (macaques), (rodent), (mice), (rats), (ferrets), (rabbits), (cats), and (dogs). Inclusion criteria were the establishment of animal models of COVID-19 as an endpoint. Other inclusion criteria were assessment of prophylaxis, therapies, or vaccines, using animal models of COVID-19. RESULT: Thirteen peer-reviewed studies and 14 preprints met the inclusion criteria. The animals used were nonhuman primates (n = 13), mice (n = 7), ferrets (n = 4), hamsters (n = 4), and cats (n = 1). All animals supported high viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract associated with mild clinical manifestations, lung pathology, and full recovery. Older animals displayed relatively more severe illness than the younger ones. No animal models developed hypoxemic respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction, culminating in death. All species elicited a specific IgG antibodies response to the spike proteins, which were protective against a second exposure. Transient systemic inflammation was observed occasionally in nonhuman primates, hamsters, and mice. Notably, none of the animals unveiled a cytokine storm or coagulopathy. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the animal models of COVID-19 recapitulated mild pattern of human COVID-19 with full recovery phenotype. No severe illness associated with mortality was observed, suggesting a wide gap between COVID-19 in humans and animal models.},

	abstract = {Studies have reported that exposure to pet therapy (PT) can reduce physiological and subjective stress and anxiety levels. The aim of this meta-analysis is to examine the efficacy of PT as a method for reducing physiological stress levels (blood pressure and heart rate) and subjective stress and anxiety scores (self-reported stress/anxiety). Further, we examined the effects of sample characteristics and modifications to the PT (different age groups and health status of participants across samples, whether a stressor was present, and individual versus group PT) as potential moderators of the relationship between PT and stress reactivity. Our searches incorporated articles published from May 2017 and earlier in PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and PubMed. This meta-analysis included 28 articles with 34 independent samples and contained a total of 1,310 participants. Using a random effects model, we determined that significant differences occurred in heart rate, self-reported anxiety, and self-reported stress after PT exposure compared with before PT. However, we did not detect significant differences in blood pressure after PT. Sample characteristics and modifications to the PT significantly moderated the effect of PT on stress responses. Our results suggest that PT can be an effective program for reducing stress reactivity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alzheimer disease (AD) initially presents with cognitive decline that affects the affected individual's daily activities. Cognitive decline reversal represents an important medical need, where Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE-5Is) might play a role. AIM: This systematic review was performed to verify the efficacy of PDE-5Is in preventing cognitive impairment and to elucidate the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Preclinical animal studies assessing the efficacy of PDE-5Is in preventing cognitive impairment and pathological changes by measuring Aβ-42 β42 and p-Tau were included in the analysis. CAMARADES Checklist was used to assess study quality. Further, various signaling pathways in different studies were examined. RESULTS AND OUTCOMES: Data of behavioral tests were extracted and a meta-analysis was conducted. Fifteen animal trials met the inclusion criteria, and all reported the prevention of cognitive deficits by PDE-5Is in Alzheimer's disease. A significant effect of PDE-5Is in increasing the time spent in the target quadrant was reported in four of seven studies using the water maze. Four studies showed significant improvement in contextual fear memory freezing time, and three studies showed improvement in the 14 unit maze number of errors. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive decline in preclinical AD finds tauopathy has a more impact than Aβ-42. This systematic review showed that PDE-5 inhibitors might help prevent cognitive impairment in AD, and while its mechanism of action is non-related to Aβ-42, it might include decrease p-Tau, increase CREB and BDNF or suppressing apoptosis and inflammation. However, the efficacy of PDE-5 inhibitors in preventing cognitive impairment remains unclear due to various limitations, such as the small number of included studies, the high risk of bias, the lack of an integrated study design, and low reporting quality.},

	abstract = {Scrub typhus, caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi, is an important and neglected vector-borne zoonotic disease with an expanding known distribution. The ecology of the disease is complex and poorly understood, impairing discussion of public health interventions. To highlight what we know and the themes of our ignorance, we conducted a systematic review of all studies investigating the pathogen in vectors and non-human hosts. A total of 276 articles in 7 languages were included, with 793 study sites across 30 countries. There was no time restriction for article inclusion, with the oldest published in 1924. Seventy-six potential vector species and 234 vertebrate host species were tested, accounting for over one million trombiculid mites ('chiggers') and 83,000 vertebrates. The proportion of O. tsutsugamushi positivity was recorded for different categories of laboratory test and host species. Vector and host collection sites were geocoded and mapped. Ecological data associated with these sites were summarised. A further 145 articles encompassing general themes of scrub typhus ecology were reviewed. These topics range from the life-cycle to transmission, habitats, seasonality and human risks. Important gaps in our understanding are highlighted together with possible tools to begin to unravel these. Many of the data reported are highly variable and inconsistent and minimum data reporting standards are proposed. With more recent reports of human Orientia sp. infection in the Middle East and South America and enormous advances in research technology over recent decades, this comprehensive review provides a detailed summary of work investigating this pathogen in vectors and non-human hosts and updates current understanding of the complex ecology of scrub typhus. A better understanding of scrub typhus ecology has important relevance to ongoing research into improving diagnostics, developing vaccines and identifying useful public health interventions to reduce the burden of the disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Resting endoscopy has commonly been used as a method to predict laryngeal function at exercise. OBJECTIVES: To perform a meta-analysis to determine the sensitivity and specificity of resting laryngeal endoscopy to predict clinical recurrent laryngeal neuropathy at exercise. STUDY DESIGN: Meta-analysis. METHODS: Manuscripts were included if data were available for both resting and exercising airway function on all or a subset of horses. Normal resting endoscopy was defined as laryngeal grades 1 or 2 on a 4-/7-point scale or 1, 2 or 3 on a 5-point scale and normal dynamic endoscopy as a dynamic laryngeal grade A. RESULTS: Twelve studies including 1827 horses were evaluated. A small proportion of horses with grade 1 or grade 2 laryngeal function at rest, 3.5 and 11.9\%, respectively, were identified as having abnormal laryngeal function at exercise. Within the horses with grade 3 laryngeal function at rest, 16\% were classified as grade A, 26.4\% as grade B and 57.6\% as grade C at exercise. Worsening subgrades within resting grade 3 demonstrated an increasing proportion of complete or partial paralysis at exercise. The sensitivity and specificity of resting endoscopy was 74.4 and 95.1\%, respectively, and the positive and negative predictive values were 85.6 and 90.5\% respectively. MAIN LIMITATIONS: Use of two separate grading systems for evaluating resting laryngeal function. Other forms of dynamic airway collapse were not evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Resting endoscopy is sensitive and highly specific for predicting laryngeal function at exercise. Dynamic endoscopy is important to assess multiple causes of airway collapse.},

AIM: To systematically review the literature on milk feed osmolality and adverse gastrointestinal events in newborn and low birthweight infants and animals. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, CAB Abstracts, Current Contents, BIOSIS Previews and SciSearch were searched from inception to May 2018 to identify potentially relevant studies. INCLUSION CRITERIA: randomised controlled or observational studies of newborn and low birthweight infants or animals investigating the effects of milk-based feeds with different osmolalities. Only full-text, English-language papers were included. RESULTS: Ten human and six animal studies met the inclusion criteria. Of human studies, seven reported no differences in adverse events with varying feed osmolalities; one reported delayed gastric emptying with feed osmolarity of 539 mOsm/L compared with lower levels; one reported higher necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) incidence with feed osmolarity of 650 mOsm/L compared with 359 mOsm/L; one found higher NEC incidence with the lowest feed osmolality (326 mOsm/kg compared with 385 mOsm/kg). Of animal studies, two reported delayed gastric emptying with feed osmolarity {\textgreater}624 mOsm/L, one reported decreased survival due to dehydration with dietary osmolarities ≥765 mOsmol/L and none reported increased NEC incidence with differing feed osmolalities. No clear mechanisms were found, and diet composition differences limited the interpretations regarding the independent impact of osmolality. CONCLUSIONS: There is no consistent evidence that differences in feed osmolality in the range 300-500 mOsm/kg are associated with adverse gastrointestinal symptoms in neonates.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many lung diseases. Preclinical studies suggest that mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) conditioned media (CdM) can attenuate inflammation. Our aim was threefold: (1) summarize the existing animal literature evaluating CdM as a therapeutic agent for pediatric/adult lung disease, (2) quantify the effects of CdM on inflammation, and (3) compare inflammatory effects of CdM to MSCs. METHODS: Adhering to the Systematic Review Protocol for Animal Intervention Studies, a systematic search of English articles was performed in five databases. Meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed to generate random effect size using standardized mean difference (SMD). RESULTS: A total of 10 studies met inclusion. Lung diseases included bronchopulmonary dysplasia, asthma, pulmonary hypertension, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. CdM decreased inflammatory cells (1.02 SMD, 95\% CI 0.86, 1.18) and cytokines (0.71 SMD, 95\% CI 0.59, 0.84). The strongest effect for inflammatory cells was in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (3.74 SMD, 95\% CI 3.13, 4.36) while pulmonary hypertension had the greatest reduction in inflammatory cytokine expression (1.44 SMD, 95\% CI 1.18, 1.71). Overall, CdM and MSCs had similar anti-inflammatory effects. CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis of animal models recapitulating lung disease, CdM improved inflammation and had an effect size comparable to MSCs.

Although limited, murine models represent a promising attempt in order to gain knowledge in this field. Objective: A systematic review and meta-analysis examining various treatment protocols was conducted in order to determine the impact of exercise on tumor growth in rodents. Methods: PubMed, Google scholar and System for information on Gray literature in Europe were screened from inception to October 2017. Risk of bias within individual studies was assessed using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation risk of bias rating tool for human and animal trials. The effect of exercise on tumor growth over and above non-exercise control was pooled using random-effects model. Subgroup analyses were conducted to identify potential moderators. Results: The quality of the included 17 articles ranged between "probably low" and "high risk of bias." A significant reduction in tumor growth in exercising animals compared to controls was detected (Hedges' g = -0.40; 95\% CI -0.66 to -0.14, p {\textless} 0.01) with between-study heterogeneity (τ(2) = 0.217, I (2) = 70.28\%, p {\textless} 0.001). The heterogeneity was partially explained by three moderators representing the in-between group differences of "maximum daily exercise" R (2) = 33\% (p {\textless} 0.01), "type of cancer administration" R (2) = 28\% (p {\textless} 0.05), and "training initiation" R (2) = 27\% (p {\textless} 0.05). Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that physical exercise leads to reduction of tumor size in rodents. Since "maximum daily exercise" was found to have at least modest impact on tumor growth, more clinical trials investigating dose-response relationships are needed.},

	abstract = {Zoonotic pathogens constitute the major source (60.3\%) of emerging infectious diseases. Previous studies have investigated the prevalence of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) among wild animal species, but comprehensive data are needed to assess the role that these animals have in the transmission of STEC infections to the human population via faecal contamination of the environment, agri-food or water chain. Due to the nature of these microorganisms in which this human-animal-environment interface plays a relevant role on the disease's dynamics, a "One Health" approach is needed to prevent and control the worldwide spread. The aim of this study was to review the published research on the prevalence of STEC in wildlife. The search was performed using several online databases consisting of three blocks of specific search terms covering pathogen, type of study and population. Two reviewers applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to screening and eligibility phases. Two hundred and twenty-five abstracts were screened for relevance, and 72 were included for data analysis. Most studies (77.8\%) investigated the prevalence of STEC in ruminants and urban birds. Their role in transmitting the pathogen to humans, other animals and the agri-food chain is potentiated by the peculiar biological characteristics in ruminants and improved adaptation of urban birds to urban environments. The popularity of convenience and voluntary response sampling may be due to the lack of human-made boundaries on the wild animal species' habitat and having some samples from hunted-harvested animals. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review on STEC prevalence in wild animal species from studies conducted across the globe. We recommend that future research includes and compares samples from varying origins (i.e., human, animal, environment and food) and applies a "One Health" approach to the emerging challenges that STEC poses to public health.},

	abstract = {Arboviruses represent a significant burden to public health and local economies due to their ability to cause unpredictable and widespread epidemics. To maximize early detection of arbovirus emergence in non-endemic areas, surveillance efforts should target areas where circulation is most likely. However, identifying such hotspots of potential emergence is a major challenge. The ecological conditions leading to arbovirus outbreaks are shaped by complex interactions between the virus, its vertebrate hosts, arthropod vector, and abiotic environment that are often poorly understood. Here, we systematically review the ecological risk factors associated with the circulation of six arboviruses that are of considerable concern to northwestern Europe. These include three mosquito-borne viruses (Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Rift Valley fever virus) and three tick-borne viruses (Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and louping-ill virus). We consider both intrinsic (e.g. vector and reservoir host competence) and extrinsic (e.g. temperature, precipitation, host densities, land use) risk factors, identify current knowledge gaps, and discuss future directions. Our systematic review provides baseline information for the identification of regions and habitats that have suitable ecological conditions for endemic circulation, and therefore may be used to target early warning surveillance programs aimed at detecting multi-virus and/or arbovirus emergence.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: We have performed a systematic search to summarize the role of statins for preventing and treating severe preeclampsia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine whether pravastatin is a useful and safe alternative for treating preeclampsia during pregnancy. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic MEDLINE (PubMed) search was performed (1979 to June 2017), which was restricted to articles published in English, using the relevant key words of "statins," "pregnancy," "preeclampsia," "obstetrical antiphospholipid syndrome," and "teratogenicity." RESULTS: The initial search provided 296 articles. Finally, 146 articles were related to the use of statins during pregnancy, regarding their effect on the fetus and the treatment of preeclampsia. Ten studies were related to in vitro studies, 25 in animals, and 24 in humans (13 case report series and 11 cohort studies). We found 84 studies on reviews of such guidelines on cardiovascular disease (35 studies), use of statins in the antiphospholipid syndrome (25 studies), statin's specific use during pregnancy (13 studies), or preeclampsia treatment (11 studies). CONCLUSIONS: Although the studies are of poor quality, the rate of major congenital abnormalities in the newborn exposed to statins during pregnancy is no higher than the expected when compared with overall risk population. The review shows a potential beneficial role of statins in preventing and treating severe preeclampsia that needs to be evaluated through well-designed clinical trials. RELEVANCE: This update could influence positively the clinical practice, giving an alternative therapy for clinicians who treat preeclampsia, particularly in severe cases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: West Nile Virus (WNV), a member of the genus Flavivirus, is one of the most widely distributed arboviruses in the world. Despite some evidence for circulation of WNV in countries summarized by the World Health Organization as the Eastern Mediterrian Regional Office (EMRO), comprehensive knowledge about its epidemiology remains largely unknown. This study aims to provide a concise review of the published literature on WNV infections in the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office of WHO (EMRO). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A systematic review of WNV prevalence studies on humans, animals and vectors in the EMRO region was performed by searching: Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, PubMed, Embase and Google Scholar. Finally, 77 citations were included, comprising 35 seroprevalence studies on general population (24460 individuals), 15 prevalence studies among patients (3439 individuals), 22 seroprevalence studies among animals (10309 animals), and 9 studies on vectors (184242 vector species). Of the 22 countries in this region, five had no data on WNV infection among different populations. These countries include Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Syria and Somalia. On the other hand, among countries with available data, WNV-specific antibodies were detected in the general population of all investigated countries including Djibouti (0.3-60\%), Egypt (1-61\%), Iran (0-30\%), Iraq (11.6-15.1\%), Jordan (8\%), Lebanon (0.5-1\%), Libya (2.3\%), Morocco (0-18.8\%), Pakistan (0.6-65.0\%), Sudan (2.2-47\%), and Tunisia (4.3-31.1\%). WNV RNA were also detected in patient populations of Iran (1.2\%), Pakistan (33.3\%), and Tunisia (5.3\% -15.9\%). WNV-specific antibodies were also detected in a wide range of animal species. The highest seropositivity rate was observed among equids (100\% in Morocco) and dogs (96\% in Morocco). The highest seroprevalence among birds was seen in Tunisia (23\%). In addition, WNV infection was detected in mosquitoes (Culex, and Aedes) and ticks (Argas reflexus hermanni). The primary vector of WNV (Culex pipiens s.l.) was detected in Djibouti, Egypt, Iran and Tunisia, and in mosquitoes of all these countries, WNV was demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: This first systematic regional assessment of WNV prevalence provides evidence to support the circulation of WNV in the EMRO region as nearly all studies showed evidence of WNV infection in human as well as animal/vector populations. These findings highlight the need for continued prevention and control strategies and the collection of epidemiologic data for WNV epidemic status, especially in countries that lack reliable surveillance systems.},

	abstract = {AIM OF THE REVIEW: Animal models are essential in advancing resuscitation research but are susceptible to various biases compromising internal validity, which may explain unsuccessful transition to human clinical trials. This study aimed to assess risk of bias in animal studies of cardiac arrest. DATA SOURCES: This study was based on a previous systematic review of all animal cardiac arrest studies published between March 8, 2011 and March 8, 2016 in PubMed and EMBASE. For this study, we focused on interventional studies and selected a random sample of 50 pig and 50 rat studies. We used a modified version of the SYRCLE's risk of bias tool for animal studies. Bias assessment was performed by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: 92\% of pig studies and 88\% of rat studies used randomization to assign interventions, but the methodology was unknown or insufficiently reported in 60\% and 68\% of the studies, respectively. Correct timing of randomization was lacking or unclear in over half of the studies. 40\% of pig studies and 28\% of rat studies reported insufficient baseline characteristics. When possible, blinding was not performed/reported in 68\% of rat studies and 31\% of pig studies. Blinding of outcome assessors was missing or inadequately reported in 65\% of pig studies and 60\% of rat studies. 80\% of all studies lacked a sample size calculation, while 60\% of pig and 80\% of rat studies omitted a specified primary outcome. CONCLUSION: This study indicates insufficient reporting and methodological shortcomings in animal models of cardiac arrest.},

	abstract = {Toxocariasis is a neglected tropical disease of humans. Although many studies have indicated or shown that environmental contamination with Toxocara species eggs is a major risk factor for toxocariasis in humans, there has been no comprehensive analysis of published data or information. Here, we conducted the first systematic review and meta-analysis of current literature to assess the global prevalence of Toxocara eggs in public places (including beaches, parks and playgrounds). We conducted searches of the PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Science Direct databases for relevant studies published until 20 April 2018, and assessed the prevalence rates of Toxocara eggs in public places. We used the random effects model to calculate pooled prevalence estimates, with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs), and analysed data in relation to WHO geographical regions. Subgroup analysis and meta-regressions regarding the geographical and environmental variables were also performed. Of 2384 publications identified, 109 studies that tested 42,797 soil samples in 40 countries were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled global prevalence of Toxocara eggs in public places was 21\% (95\% CI, 16-27\%; 13,895/42,797). The estimated prevalence rates in the different WHO regions ranged from 13\% to 35\%: Western Pacific (35\%; 95\% CI, 15-58\%), Africa (27\%; 95\% CI, 11-47\%), South America (25\%; 95\% CI, 13-33\%), South-East Asia (21\%; 95\% CI, 3-49\%), Middle East and North Africa (18\%; 95\% CI, 11-24\%), Europe (18\%; 95\% CI, 14-22\%), and North and Central Americas (13\%; 95\% CI, 8-23\%). A high prevalence was significantly associated with high geographical longitude (P = 0.04), low latitude (P = 0.02) and high relative environmental humidity (P = 0.04). This meta-analysis of data from published records indicates that public places are often heavily contaminated with eggs of Toxocara.

In recent years, consume fishes and shrimps has increased in Iran, and several study about heavy metals content in fishes and shrimps from Persian Gulf were carried out to check their food safety. The aims of these systematic reviews and meta-analysis was to summarize the evidence on the relation of the intakes of Arsenic (As) and lead (Pb) levels, based on the origin and sub-groups of shrimp species consumed, Hence that we can estimate the risk of oral cancer induced by Pb and As in these groups of shrimp from the persian gulf. We carried out a search of all suitable studies published between 1995 and 2017 in Scopus, Science Direct, PubMed and Web of Science databases. Since the heterogeneity among studied was significant, we used the random effect model (REM) to perform meta-analysis of data. Data were obtained from 9 articles (14 studies), with 511 samples, and it was reported that pooled levels of As and Pb in the muscle shrimps were 1.37 (95\% CI: 0.66-2.08 mg/kg d.w.) and 0.58 (95\% CI: 0.33-0.82 mg/kg d.w.), respectively. This pooled levels in muscle shrimps were higher than safe dose reported on Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization guidelines (FAO/WHO). The rank order of shrimps species based on As was Panulirus homarus {\textgreater} Penaeus semisulcatus and for the Pb levels was Litopenaeus vannamei {\textgreater} Panulirus homarus {\textgreater} Fenneropenaeus indicus {\textgreater} Metapenaeus affinis. The lowest and highest risk levels of oral cancer, divided by consumers age groups, were respectively 45-54 (6.94E-04) and 15-24 (8.42E-04) for the Pb, and 45-54 (2.87E-01) and 15-24 (3.51E-01) for arsenic. Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR) of Pb and As was higher than 10-4 and 10-3, respectively. All groups (age) of consumers are subject to the cancer risk of due to the consumption of shrimps contaminated by Pb and As, therefore, should be started a control plan for the reduction of the heavy metal bioaccumulation levels in shrimps of the Persian Gulf coupled to a capillary food safety communication.},

The pooled concentration of PHEs in fillet trout fishes was meta-analyzed using a random-effect model (REM) and following the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks was calculated using the Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) method. The meta-analysis of 42 articles (43 data report) revealed that a sort of PHEs in fillet trout was 19,996.64 μg/kg ww for Fe; 1834.75 μg/kg ww for Co; 772.21 μg/kg ww for Cu; 335.78 μg/kg ww for Ni; 290.46 μg/kg ww for Se; 226.20for Cr; 178.11 μg/kg ww for Pb; 77.40 μg/kg ww for Hg; 19.40 μg/kg ww for Cd; and 3.66 μg/kg ww for inorganic As. The non-carcinogenic risk assessment indicated that the lowest and highest hazard index (HI) in the adults was Pakistan (0.0012) and Turkey (0.2388), respectively, and in children was Pakistan (0.0057) and Turkey (1.114), respectively. The non-carcinogenic risk was acceptable for adult consumers in all countries (HI {\textgreater} 1 value) but non-carcinogenic risk for children was not acceptable in Turkey.

Many countries are trying to reduce the use of animals; thus, alternative techniques, such as ex vivo tests, in vitro assays, and ex uteri embryos, are used. Toxicological assays using zebrafish embryos are an advantageous technique because they are transparent, have rapid embryonic development, and do not require invasive techniques. This paper comprehensively reviews how toxicity testing with plant products is conducted in zebrafish embryos. The search terms zebra fish, Danio rerio, zebrafish, zebra danio, Brachydanio rerio, zebrafish, and embryos were used to search for English-language articles in PUBMED, SCOPUS, and WEB OF SCIENCE. Twelve articles on plant product toxicity studies using zebrafish were selected for reading and analysis. After analyzing the articles and comparing with results in mammals, it was possible to prove the similarity among the results and thus corroborate the further development of zebrafish as a valid tool in toxicity tests.},

We added five records from the reference list of the fully-read articles and seven suggested by the expert. Twelve articles were excluded. In the end, 18 studies were considered for this systematic review. Ten studies were conducted with green banana flour and eight with the green banana pulp/biomass. Most of the GB health benefits studied were related to the gastrointestinal symptoms/diseases, followed by the glycemic/insulin metabolism, weight control, and renal and liver complications associated to diabetes. Only one study did not confirm the health benefit proposed. It is necessary to standardize the GB dose/effect to different age groups and different health effects considering the GB variety and ripeness level. Further studies are necessary to present better detailing of GB product and their health effects considering all the raw-material characteristics.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Simple obesity has become a global risk to health of human beings. Acupuncture, as one of traditional Chinese medicine therapies, has been widely used in obesity treatment in recent years. However, the individual heterogeneity which makes acupuncture's efficiency unstable leads to some controversy. So more evidence-based results are necessary to judge the effectiveness of acupuncture in treatment of simple obesity. Compared with clinical trials, animal experiments are controllable, and the underlying mechanism is more likely to be explored. Last but not the least, more and more experimental studies on acupuncture for animal obesity have been published. Therefore, we conducted the systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating simple obesity in animal experiments. METHODS: Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) on acupuncture for simple obesity animal models were searched from six databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, CNKI, VIP, WanFang Date, and CMB from inception to February 2017 and updated on April 12, 2019. RevMan 5.3 software was used for meta-analysis. Treatment effects were summarized as relative risk (RR) and Standard mean difference (SMD) with 95\% of confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 108 trials involving 5731 rats were included. Meta-analysis showed that acupuncture had better effect on reducing weight (SMD -2.60, 95\%CI: -2.93 to -2.26, p{\textless}0.00001) and Lee's index (SMD -2.62, 95\%CI:-3.18 to -2.06, p{\textless}0.00001) compared with control group. However, the methodological quality of included studies was generally poor. Details of blinding were not reported in most studies. In spite of high heterogeneity being observed on the merged data, sensitivity analysis using the leave-one-out approach, subgroup analysis based on different acupuncture techniques, and rat strains and meta-regression all failed to find the sources of heterogeneity. The asymmetric funnel plot suggested publication bias. Besides, adverse events were not reported in any reports. CONCLUSIONS: Our review provided positive evidence of acupuncture for simple obesity. Unfortunately, none of the firm conclusions can be drawn due to methodological flaws, high heterogeneity, and publication bias. More high-quality trials are needed in future to get objective conclusions.},

	abstract = {The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize the available knowledge on the seroprevalence of T. gondii in roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and red deer (Cervus elaphus) in Europe. A computerized literature search of electronic databases (PubMed and CAB abstracts) was performed along with hand searches of library resources for relevant papers, books, abstracts and conference proceedings. A random-effect model was employed to calculate pooled seroprevalence estimates with 95\% confidence intervals, and I(2) statistic was used to assess heterogeneity. Further, moderator analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of geographical area on the seroprevalence in roe deer. From a total of 190 studies initially identified, 16 and 8 articles were included for roe deer and red deer, respectively. These comprise 3,913 roe deer and 2,913 red deer from different European countries. The pooled seroprevalence was estimated to be 29\% (95\% CI: 23\%-35\%) in roe deer and 15\% (95\% CI: 10\%-20\%) in red deer. High heterogeneity was detected in the seroprevalence data within each species. In roe deer, the pooled seroprevalence estimate was significantly different according to geographical area with 40\% (95\% CI: 31\%-49\%) in Western Europe, 31\% (95\% CI: 21\%-43\%) in Northern Europe, 27\% (95\% CI: 15\%-41\%) in Eastern Europe and 21\% (95\% CI: 14\%-28\%) in Southern Europe. The present study indicates a moderate exposure to T. gondii in roe deer and red deer in Europe, with very high prevalence in Western Europe. Our results highlight the significant risk associated to the consumption of venison, encouraging proper handling and cooking of game meat to prevent toxoplasmosis in humans.},

To this end, we systematically reviewed the serotonergic agents used for the treatment of LIDs in a 6-hydroxydopamine model of Parkinson's disease in rats. We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, and Proquest for entries no later than March 2018, and restricted the search to publications on serotonergic agents used for the treatment of LIDs in hemiparkinsonian rats. The initial search yielded 447 citations, of which 49 articles and one conference paper met our inclusion criteria. The results revealed ten different categories of serotonergic agents, including but not limited to 5-HT(1A/B)R agonists, 5-HT(2A)R antagonists, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), all of which improved LIDs without imposing considerable adverse effects. Although there is promising evidence regarding the role of these agents in relieving LIDs in hemiparkinsonian rats, further studies are needed for the enlightenment of hidden aspect of these molecules in terms of mechanisms and outcomes. Given this, improving the quality of the pre-clinical studies and designing appropriate clinical trials will help fill the bench-to-bedside gap.},

	abstract = {To tackle antimicrobial resistance, it is vital that farmers' and veterinarians' antimicrobial use behaviors and attitudes toward resistance are understood so that we can identify how beliefs and motives influence practices. Current literature details qualitative and quantitative research that explores the knowledge, attitudes and perceptions of dairy farmers and veterinarians with respect to antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial practices, and the reported findings are varied and conflicting. Our objective was to conduct a systematic review to assess the evidence and knowledge gaps in the published literature. We identified articles via database searches of Embase, Medline, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science; we limited findings to published articles available in English with no publication year restrictions. Article screening was conducted at 3 levels: title, abstract, and full text. Of the 349 articles identified, 35 were retained for systematic review. Transparency of reporting was assessed for each study using the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) framework. Quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme qualitative checklist. Findings relating to dairy farmers' and veterinarians' knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions on antimicrobial resistance and practices were thematically analyzed. The comprehensiveness of reporting was variable: studies reported 5 to 26 of the 32 COREQ checklist items. Five key themes emerged from the data: knowledge and awareness of antimicrobial resistance; factors influencing farmer and veterinarian decision-making; perceived barriers and facilitators to reduced antimicrobial use; perceived responsibility for antimicrobial resistance; and the role of the farmer and veterinarian relationship in reducing antimicrobial use. Awareness of prudent antimicrobial use was not uniform between studies. Many factors influence farmers' and veterinarians' decisions to use antimicrobials, including animal welfare and available resources. The farmer-veterinarian relationship is a potential barrier or facilitator of reduced antimicrobial use, depending on the perceived relationship dynamic. Encouraging collaboration between farmers and veterinarians could lead to shared responsibility for reducing antimicrobial use. This review provided a coherent picture of what is currently known and identified gaps in the current knowledge to inform future behavioral intervention research. Increased knowledge, skill development, resources, engagement, and further research to address the gaps we identified are the main recommendations to effectively overcome barriers, elicit appropriate behavior change, and achieve reduced antimicrobial use in dairy cattle.},

Treatment with therapeutic hypothermia reduced adverse outcomes from 60 to 45\%. Additional strategies are urgently needed to further improve the outcome for these neonates. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is a potential neuroprotective target. This article reviews the evidence of neuroprotection by nitric oxide (NO) synthesis inhibition in animal models. METHODS: Literature search using the EMBASE, Medline, Cochrane, and PubMed databases. Studies comparing NOS inhibition to placebo, with neuroprotective outcome measures, in relevant animal models were included. Methodologic quality of the included studies was assessed. RESULTS: 26 studies were included using non-selective or selective NOS inhibition in rat, piglet, sheep, or rabbit animal models. A large variety in outcome measures was reported. Outcome measures were grouped as histological, biological, or neurobehavioral. Both non-selective and selective inhibitors show neuroprotective properties in one or more outcome measures. Methodologic quality was either low or moderate for all studies. CONCLUSION: Inhibition of NO synthesis is a promising strategy for additional neuroprotection. In humans, intervention can only take place after the onset of the hypoxic-ischemic event. Therefore, combined inhibition of neuronal and inducible NOS seems the most likely candidate for human clinical trials. Future studies should determine its safety and effectiveness in neonates, as well as a potential sex-specific neuroprotective effect. Researchers should strive to improve methodologic quality of animal intervention studies by using a systematic approach in conducting and reporting of these studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Stem/progenitor cell-mediated pulpal regeneration could represent a promising therapeutic alternative in the field of clinical endodontics. AIM: The present study aimed to systematically assess and meta-analyse dental pulpal tissue regeneration, pulpal vitality and apical healing after the transplantation of stem/progenitor cells versus no transplantation. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL and EMBASE were searched up to January 2019 for animal experiments and human trials evaluating the pulpal transplantation of stem/progenitor cells. Cross-referencing and hand search were additionally performed. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTIONS: Based on randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs), conducted in animals or humans, the effect of the transplantation of stem/progenitor cells compared to no transplantation on pulpal tissue regeneration, pulpal vitality and apical healing was examined. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: The primary outcome was histologically determined pulpal tissue regeneration, whilst pulpal vitality and apical healing were secondary outcomes. The SYstematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) guidelines and the revised Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB 2.0) were used for risk-of-bias assessment. Pooled standardized differences in means (SDM) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) were calculated using random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: From 2834 identified articles, eight animal experiments (82 animals with 336 experimental pulpal defects) and one human trial (40 humans with 40 pulpal defects) were included. Risk of bias of most animal studies was high, whilst the human trial revealed 'some concerns'. Stem/progenitor cell-transplanted pulps demonstrated significantly increased pulpal tissue regeneration compared with controls (SDM [95\%CI]: 6.29 [3.78-8.80]). LIMITATIONS: Data on pulpal vitality and apical healing were sparse and inconsistent. Heterogeneity across studies was substantial, publication bias was present, and mainly indirect, surrogate outcome measures were applied. The overall strength of evidence was very low. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS OF KEY FINDINGS: The transplanation of stem/progenitor cells shows promise for pulp regeneration, whilst clinical routine application is still not in reach. Further investigations, employing a comprehensive set of outcomes including those demonstrating functional pulp regeneration relevant for patient-centred care, are required.},

All the articles were deeply studied for cell types, scaffold types and animal models used along with study design and results. Five types of cells were used for in vitro while seven types of cells were used for in vivo studies. Three types of animal models were used for scaffold implantation purpose. Moreover, different types of scaffolds either seeded with cells or supplemented with various factors were explored and discussed in detail.

METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify relevant studies on honey used as an alternative treatment of gastric ulcer cause by NSAIDs. A comprehensive search was conducted in Medline, SCOPUS, and Ebscohost. The main criteria used were articles published in English and using NSAIDs-induced gastric ulcer in rat's model and those reporting the effectiveness of honey. RESULTS: Articles published between 2001 and 2014 were identified to be relevant in studies related to the inclusion criteria. The literature search found 30 potential and closely related articles in this review, but only 5 articles were taken which meet the criteria needed to be fulfilled. CONCLUSIONS: All studies in this review reported the efficacy of honey for gastric ulcer based on its antioxidant and cytoprotective activities. Most of the studies conducted used different types of honey at various doses on rats. Future studies should be conducted to identify the appropriate dose for humans to achieve similar gastroprotective effects.},

In the present study, the efficiency of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation in the treatment of UI was evaluated. METHODS: Combinations of the key words 'mesenchymal stem cells', 'MSCs', 'urinary incontinence', 'urethral sphincter' and 'involuntary urination' were searched in PubMed and Science Direct databases. Following application of exclusion criteria to the 1946 papers obtained and review and duplicate articles were removed, 23 articles were considered further. The search was limited to the animal model studies. RESULTS: The data obtained from the evaluation of different studies indicated that the injected MSCs play an important role in the neovascularization and the recovery of muscle cells in UI models through the paracrine process. CONCLUSION: The obtained data suggested that further trials are needed to be focused on clinical phase of MSC therapy on the patients affected by UI.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Tube thoracostomy is frequently used in thoracic trauma patients. However, there is no consensus on whether low pressure suction or water seal is the optimal method of tube management. Against this background, we performed a systematic review of studies comparing suction and water seal management of chest tubes placed for traumatic chest injuries in adults. Evaluated outcomes are duration of chest tube treatment, length of stay in hospital, incidence of persistent air leak, clotted hemothorax, and the need for (re-)interventions. METHODS: A systematic literature search according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines was performed. Included studies were evaluated according to the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias, and according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines for assessing the quality of evidence. RESULTS: After assessment of 120 identified studies, three RCT's (randomized controlled trials) were included in this review and meta-analysis. A favorable effect of suction was found for duration of chest tube treatment [MD (mean difference) - 3.38 days, P = 0.005], length of stay in hospital (MD -3.90 days, P = 0.0003), and the incidence of persistent air leak [OR (odds ratio) 0.27, P = 0.001]. No significant difference was found for the incidence of clotted hemothorax and (re-)interventions. The quality of evidence according to GRADE was low, except for persistent air leak (moderate). CONCLUSIONS: Suction seems to have a positive effect on duration of chest tube treatment, length of stay in hospital and persistent air leakage in chest trauma. However, available data was limited and the quality of evidence was (very) low to moderate according to GRADE.},

	abstract = {PROBLEM: Psychological and symptom disturbances seriously affect hospitalized children's subjective experiences of hospitalization and their prognosis. We systematically reviewed the effects of animal-assisted therapy (AAT) on pain, anxiety, depression, stress, blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR) in hospitalized children and teenagers. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using the English-language electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Clinical Trials, Science Direct, EBSCOhost, Open Grey and Google Scholar, and the Chinese databases CNKI, Sinomed, Vip, and WanFang. These databases were searched through July 15, 2020. SAMPLE: Eight studies, including four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and four quasi-experimental studies were included, with a total of 348 participants. RESULTS: Hospitalized children and teenagers with AAT had less pain (standardized mean difference = -0.49; 95\% confidence interval [CI], -0.77 to -0.22; P {\textless} 0.001), lower systolic blood pressure (mean difference [MD] = -4.85; 95\% CI, -9.50 to -0.21; P(=) 0.04), higher diastolic blood pressure (MD = 4.95; 95\% CI, 1.90 to 8.00; P(= 0.001)) than controls, while there was no significant difference in depression, anxiety, stress, or HR. CONCLUSION: As an adjuvant to traditional treatment, AAT was beneficial for controlling pain and BP in hospitalized children and teenagers. IMPLICATION: AAT may be an effective strategy for relieving pain and controlling BP in hospitalized children and teenagers, especially those with cancer. High-quality RCTs conducted or supported by nurses on the effects of AAT are needed.},

Titles and abstracts were screened by two of the authors independently. A total of 22 studies was included in the analysis. The definition of GOR implied the presence of fluids not reaching the mouth or nose in the oesophagus in all studies. Most studies considered a change in pH using oesophageal pH meters as the sole method of assessment. Calibration of the pH probe was inconsistently reported. The position of the tip of the oesophageal probe was inconsistent and not always precisely described. The correct positioning in the intended location was verified in a limited number of studies. Some studies considered that GOR had happened for changes in pH below 4.0 or above 7.5 while others considered that GOR had happened when the pH dropped below 4.0 only. Some studies stated that the pH change had to be sustained for a minimum period of time (20 or 30 s) whereas others did not mention any duration. The variability of definitions and methods of assessment of GOR in anaesthetized dogs precludes meaningful comparison of the findings. Re-evaluation and uniformization of the methods appear necessary.},

	abstract = {Wind energy is a key component of climate action strategies aimed at reducing our dependence on fossil fuels. Despite providing environmental benefits, there are increasing concerns surrounding the impact of wind farms on wildlife, with research indicating that effects on wildlife can be highly variable between species, regions, and sites. In light of this variability and the accelerating growth of the wind energy sector globally, a comprehensive understanding of wind farm effects on wildlife and ease of access to this knowledge are pivotal to inform best practice if wind energy is to become a truly sustainable source of energy. This review evaluates interactions between a globally distributed bird genus (harriers, Circus sp.) and wind farms to assess broader patterns in wildlife-wind energy knowledge accessibility and bias. A systematic review of grey and peer-reviewed literature across two multidisciplinary and two field-specific databases in two languages (English and Spanish) yielded 235 relevant sources, covering 12 harrier species and 31 countries. Findings indicate that harriers are considered to have high sensitivity to wind farms, with greatest impacts expected from habitat effects rather than from turbine collisions. In the broader wildlife-wind energy context, this study underscores (i) the predominance of grey literature and of sources solely documenting species-wind farm overlaps; (ii) limitations in grey literature availability and peer-reviewed publication accessibility; (iii) lack of standardized research and monitoring practices; and (iv) evidence of language, taxonomic, and geographic bias in literature sources. Overall, findings demonstrate that limited accessibility to wildlife-wind energy knowledge risks widening the research-implementation gap. Widespread implementation of open practices that allow researchers and practitioners to build on existing knowledge (e.g. national and international online repositories and databases, knowledge sharing and collaborative initiatives, open access publications) is crucial if ongoing wind energy development efforts are to be successfully aligned with conservation priorities.},

The purpose of this review was to critically elucidate the efficacy of these nutraceutical therapies in delaying the progression of osteoarthritis, evaluating their impact on the synovial knee joint tissues and biochemical markers in preclinical studies by systematically reviewing the last two decades of peer-reviewed publications on experimental osteoarthritis. Three databases (PubMed, Scopus and, Web of Science) were screened for eligible studies. Twenty-two articles were included in the review. Preclinical studies showed a great heterogeneity among the experimental designs and their outcomes. Generally, the evaluated nutraceuticals, alone or in combination, did not seem to prevent the subchondral bone changes, the synovial inflammation or the osteophyte formation. However, further experimental studies may be needed to evaluate their effect at those levels. Regarding the cartilage status and biomarkers, positive responses were identified in approximately half of the evaluated articles. Furthermore, beneficial effects were associated with the pre-emptive administrations, higher doses and, multimodality approaches with some combined therapies. However, additional studies in the long term and with good quality and systematic design are required.},

	abstract = {Bovine respiratory disease complex (BRD) is a worldwide multifactorial infectious disease. Antimicrobials are commonly used for treating BRD because bacteria are often involved. The clinical diagnosis of BRD is a challenge, especially in adult dairy cows, where information on this syndrome is scant. Having a definition based on consistent and reliable clinical signs would improve the accuracy of BRD diagnosis and could help to develop an optimal treatment approach by an early detection. The aim of this scoping review was to review clinical signs that could be recognized by producers in dairy cattle suffering from naturally occurring infectious respiratory disease, as reported in the literature. A review of the literature was performed for articles published between January 1, 1990 and January 1, 2020. The search of literature in English, French, and Italian languages included 2 different databases (Pubmed, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/; CAB abstract, https://www.cabi.org/publishing-products/cab-abstracts/). Clinical signs were categorized as follows: (1) "general manifestations of disease," which included behavioral changes or fever; (2) "alterations in respiratory function," which included clinical signs specifically associated with the respiratory tract examination; and (3) "clinical signs of other body systems," which included clinical signs related to other systems such as diarrhea or subcutaneous emphysema. The focus of the review was on clinical signs that could be monitored by animal handlers and producers. A total of 1,067 titles were screened, and 23 studies were finally included. The most common general clinical signs were increased body temperature (reported in 83\% of studies, n = 19), change in feed intake (26\%, n = 6), altered mentation (22\%, n = 5), and decreased milk production (17\%, n = 4). The alterations in respiratory function noted were nasal discharge (74\%, n = 17), cough (65\%, n = 15), altered respiratory dynamic or dyspnea (61\%, n = 14), increased respiratory rate (43\%, n = 10), and ocular discharge or lacrimation (30\%, n = 7). The clinical signs associated with infectious respiratory disease reported in the 23 studies generally lacked a clear description of what constitutes a deviation from normality (0-50\% of studies clearly reported what was considered normal versus abnormal depending on the clinical signs). This limitation prevented any comparison between studies that apparently reported the same "clinical sign," but possibly referred to a different assessment and definition of what was considered normal versus abnormal. Therefore, the definition of clinical signs in a repeatable way with validated interobserver agreement to determine the optimal combination for the diagnosis of BRD in dairy cows is needed. This could lead to a more judicious use of antimicrobials for respiratory disease in adult dairy cows.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) is a severe and progressive disease of pulmonary arterioles. This pathology is characterized by elevation of the pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary arterial pressure, leading to right heart failure and death. Studies have demonstrated that resveratrol possesses a protective effect on the mechanisms related to the genesis of the PAH-induced by different models. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the dose-related effects of resveratrol in different models of pulmonary arterial hypertension. METHODS: To identify eligible papers, we performed a systematic literature search on Scielo, Pub- Med, and Scholar Google. The research was limited to articles written in English in the last 10 years. We used the following descriptors to search: Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension and Resveratrol, OR Resveratrol, and Animal models of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension, OR Resveratrol, and in vitro models of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension. RESULTS: 1724 studies were identified through the descriptors used, fifty-five studies with different models of pulmonary arterial hypertension were selected for the full review, forty-four were excluded after application of exclusion and inclusion criteria, totalizing eleven studies included in this systematic review. CONCLUSION: The results showed that resveratrol, at low and high doses, protects in a dosedependent manner against the development of PAH induced through monocrotaline, normoxia and hypoxia models. In addition to having chemopreventive, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiproliferative properties. In the case of PAH-related myocardial injury, resveratrol protects cells from apoptosis, thus working as an antiapoptotic agent.},

However, it is not known whether these models are also comparable regarding drug response in quantitative terms (effect size). To investigate the extent of these differences, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of approved drugs in these models. We searched on PubMed and Embase on July 3, 2019 for studies including either model, a monotherapy arm with an EMA/FDA approved drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, HbA1c assessment and a control group. Studies aimed at diabetes prevention or with surgical interventions were excluded. We calculated the Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) to compare effect sizes (HbA1c reduction) per drug and drug class across models. We included a risk of bias assessment for all included publications. A total of 121 publications met our inclusion criteria. For drugs with more than two comparisons, both models predicted the direction of the effect regarding HbA1c levels. There were no differences between the db/db mouse and ZDF rat, except for exenatide (P = 0.02) and GLP-1 agonists (P = 0.03) in which a larger effect size was calculated in the ZDF rat. Our results indicate the differences between the db/db mouse and ZDF rat are not relevant for preliminary efficacy testing. This methodology can be used to further differentiate between animal models used for the same indication, facilitating the selection of models more likely to predict human response.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Clinicians utilize lipid emulsion to treat local anesthetic toxicity and non-local anesthetic toxicities, a practice supported by animal experimentation and clinical experience. Prior meta-analysis confirmed a mortality benefit of lipid emulsion in animal models of local anesthetic toxicity but the benefit of lipid emulsion in models of non-local anesthetic toxicity remains unanswered. Further, swine suffer an anaphylactoid reaction from lipid emulsions calling into question their role as a model system to study lipid, so we examined swine and non-swine dependent outcomes in models of intravenous lipid emulsion. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the use of lipid emulsion therapy in animal models of cardiac toxicity. We quantified mortality using a random-effects odds-ratio method. Secondary outcomes included survival in the following subgroups: local-anesthetic systemic toxicity, non-local anesthetic toxicity, swine-based models, and non-swine models (e.g., rat, rabbit and dog). We assessed for heterogeneity with Cochran's Q and I(2). We examined bias with Egger's test \& funnel plot analysis. RESULTS: Of 2784 references screened, 58 met criteria for inclusion. Treatment with lipid emulsion reduced chance of death in all models of toxicity with an odds ratio of death of 0.26 (95\% CI 0.16-0.44, Z-5.21, p {\textless} 0.00001, Cohen's-d = 0.72, n = 60). Secondary outcomes confirmed a reduced chance of death in models of local anesthetic toxicity (OR 0.16 \{95\% CI 0.1-0.33\}) and non-local anesthetic toxicity (OR 0.43 \{95\% CI 0.22-0.83\}). Heterogeneity (Cochran's Q 132 \{df = 59, p {\textless} 0.01\}, I (2) = 0.55) arose primarily from animal-model and disappeared (I (2) {\textless} = 0.12) when we analyzed swine and non-swine subgroups independently. Swine only benefited in models of local anesthetic toxicity (OR 0.28 \{95\% CI 0.11-0.7\}, p = 0.0033) whereas non-swine models experienced a homogeneous benefit across all toxins (OR 0.1 \{95\% CI 0.06-0.16\}, p {\textless} 0.00001). Egger's test identified risk of bias with outliers on funnel plot analysis. DISCUSSION: Lipid emulsion therapy reduces mortality in animal models of toxicity. Heterogeneity arises from the animal-model used. Swine only benefit in models of local anesthetic toxicity, potentially due to lipid dose, experimental design or swine's anaphylactoid reaction to lipid. Outlier analysis reinforced the need for appropriate dosing of lipid emulsion along with airway management and chest compressions in the setting of cardiac arrest.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) has become a widely used technique for the rapid and accurate identification of bacteria, mycobacteria and certain fungal pathogens in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Thus far, only few attempts have been made to apply the technique in clinical parasitology, particularly regarding helminth identification. METHODS: We systematically reviewed the scientific literature on studies pertaining to MALDI-TOF MS as a diagnostic technique for helminths (cestodes, nematodes and trematodes) of medical and veterinary importance. Readily available electronic databases (i.e. PubMed/MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Google Scholar) were searched from inception to 10 October 2018, without restriction on year of publication or language. The titles and abstracts of studies were screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers. Relevant articles were read in full and included in the systematic review. RESULTS: A total of 84 peer-reviewed articles were considered for the final analysis. Most papers reported on the application of MALDI-TOF for the study of Caenorhabditis elegans, and the technique was primarily used for identification of specific proteins rather than entire pathogens. Since 2015, a small number of studies documented the successful use of MALDI-TOF MS for species-specific identification of nematodes of human and veterinary importance, such as Trichinella spp. and Dirofilaria spp. However, the quality of available data and the number of examined helminth samples was low. CONCLUSIONS: Data on the use of MALDI-TOF MS for the diagnosis of helminths are scarce, but recent evidence suggests a potential role for a reliable identification of nematodes. Future research should explore the diagnostic accuracy of MALDI-TOF MS for identification of (i) adult helminths, larvae and eggs shed in faecal samples; and (ii) helminth-related proteins that are detectable in serum or body fluids of infected individuals.},

With a high mutation rate and frequent recombination, enteroviruses are noted to evolve and change over time. Given the evidence that human enteroviruses are commonly found in other mammalian species and that some human and animal enteroviruses are genetically similar, it is possible that enzootic enteroviruses may also be infecting human populations. We conducted a systematic review of the English and Chinese literature published between 2007 and 2017 to examine evidence that enteroviruses may be zoonotic. Of the 2704 articles screened for inclusion, 16 articles were included in the final review. The review of these articles yielded considerable molecular evidence of zooanthroponosis transmission, particularly among non-human primates. While there were more limited instances of anthropozoonosis transmission, the available data support the biological plausibility of cross-species transmission and the need to conduct periodic surveillance at the human-animal interface.},

	abstract = {The skin and its microbiota serve as physical barriers to prevent invasion of pathogens. Skin damage can be a consequence of illness, surgery, and burns. The most effective wound management strategy is to prevent infections, promote healing, and prevent excess scarring. It is well established that probiotics can aid in skin healing by stimulating the production of immune cells, and they also exhibit antagonistic effects against pathogens via competitive exclusion of pathogens. Our aim was to conduct a review of recent literature on the efficacy of using probiotics against pathogens that cause wound infections. In this integrative review, we searched through the literature published in the international following databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, and Scopus using the search terms "probiotic" AND "wound infection." During a comprehensive review and critique of the selected research, fourteen in vitro studies, 8 animal studies, and 19 clinical studies were found. Two of these in vitro studies also included animal studies, yielding a total of 39 articles for inclusion in the review. The most commonly used probiotics for all studies were well-known strains of the species Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. All in vitro studies showed successful inhibition of chosen skin or wound pathogens by the selected probiotics. Within the animal studies on mice, rats, and rabbits, probiotics showed strong opportunities for counteracting wound infections. Most clinical studies showed slight or statistically significant lower incidence of surgical site infections, foot ulcer infection, or burn infections for patients using probiotics. Several of these studies also indicated a statistically significant wound healing effect for the probiotic groups. This review indicates that exogenous and oral application of probiotics has shown reduction in wound infections, especially when used as an adjuvant to antibiotic therapy, and therefore the potential use of probiotics in this field remains worthy of further studies, perhaps focused more on typical skin inhabitants as next-generation probiotics with high potential.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to blacklegged ticks Ixodes scapularis that transmit pathogens is thought to occur peri-domestically. However, the locations where people most frequently encounter infected ticks are not well characterized, leading to mixed messages from public health officials about where risk is highest. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on spatial risk factors for tick-borne disease and tick bites in eastern North America. We examined three scales: the residential yard, the neighborhood surrounding (but not including) the yard, and outside the neighborhood. Nineteen eligible studies represented 2741 cases of tick-borne illness and 1447 tick bites. Using random effects models, we derived pooled odds ratio (OR) estimates. RESULTS: The meta-analysis revealed significant disease risk factors at the scale of the yard (OR 2.60 95\% CI 1.96 - 3.46), the neighborhood (OR 4.08 95\% CI 2.49 - 6.68), and outside the neighborhood (OR 2.03 95\% CI 1.59 - 2.59). Although significant risk exists at each scale, neighborhood scale risk factors best explained disease exposure. Analysis of variance revealed risk at the neighborhood scale was 57\% greater than risk at the yard scale and 101\% greater than risk outside the neighborhood. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis emphasizes the importance of understanding and reducing tick-borne disease risk at the neighborhood scale. Risk-reducing interventions applied at each scale could be effective, but interventions applied at the neighborhood scale are most likely to protect human health.

No human vaccines are currently available, and both diagnosis and treatment are sometimes ineffectual, leading to advocacy for self-directed preventative measures. These recommendations are widely communicated to the public, but there is limited evidence for their efficacy. We undertook a systematic review and mixed-effects meta-regression analysis of factors purported to increase or decrease risk of black-legged tick bites and tick-borne disease. Published articles used in the study spanned the years 1984-2018. Variables associated with increased probability of tick-borne disease, with odds ratios significantly greater than 1, included deer abundance, high density of nymph-stage black-legged ticks, landscapes with interspersed herbaceous and forested habitat, low human population density, gardens, cat ownership, and race. Contrary to recommendations, use of landscape-related tick control measures, such as clearing brush, trimming branches, and having a dry barrier between lawn and woods, tended to increase risk. Pet ownership increased bite risk. Bite risk was highest for children aged 5 years or less, with a secondary peak in persons aged 50-70 years. Although some widely disseminated recommendations are supported by the research analyzed, others require further evaluation. Additional research is also needed to understand the mechanisms underlying significant relationships.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The α2 agonists, dexmedetomidine and clonidine, are used as sedative drugs during critical illness. These drugs may have anti-inflammatory effects, which might be relevant to critical illness, but a systematic review of published literature has not been published. We reviewed animal and human studies relevant to critical illness to summarise the evidence for an anti-inflammatory effect from α2 agonists. METHODS: We searched PubMed, the Cochrane library, and Medline. Animal and human studies published in English were included. Broad search terms were used: dexmedetomidine or clonidine, sepsis, and inflammation. Reference lists were screened for additional publications. Titles and abstracts were screened independently by two reviewers and full-text articles obtained for potentially eligible studies. Data extraction used a bespoke template given study diversity, and quality assessment was qualitative. RESULTS: Study diversity meant meta-analysis was not feasible so descriptive synthesis was undertaken. We identified 30 animal studies (caecal ligation/puncture (9), lipopolysaccharide (14), acute lung injury (5), and ischaemia-reperfusion syndrome (5)), and 9 human studies. Most animal (26 dexmedetomidine, 4 clonidine) and all human studies used dexmedetomidine. In animal studies, α2 agonists reduced serum and/or tissue TNFα (20 studies), IL-6 (17 studies), IL-1β (7 studies), NFκB (6 studies), TLR4 (6 studies), and a range of other mediators. Timing and doses varied widely, but in many cases were not directly relevant to human sedation use. In human studies, dexmedetomidine reduced CRP (4 studies), TNFα (5 studies), IL-6 (6 studies), IL-1β (3 studies), and altered several other mediators. Most studies were small and low quality. No studies related effects to clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: Evidence supports potential anti-inflammatory effects from α2 agonists, but the relevance to clinically important outcomes is uncertain. Further work should explore whether dose relationships with inflammation and clinical outcomes are present which might be separate from sedation-mediated effects.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Component-resolved diagnostics (CRD) are promising tools for diagnosing food allergy, offering the potential to determine specific phenotypes and to develop patient-tailored risk profiles. Nevertheless, the diagnostic accuracy of these tests varies across studies; thus, their clinical utility remains unclear. Therefore, we synthesized the evidence from studies investigating the diagnostic accuracy, risk assessment ability, and cost-effectiveness of CRD for food allergy. METHODS: We systematically searched 10 electronic databases and four clinical trial registries for studies published from January 2000 to February 2017. The quality of included studies was assessed using QUADAS-2. Due to heterogeneity, we narratively synthesized the evidence. RESULTS: Eleven studies met inclusion criteria, altogether recruiting 1098 participants. The food allergies investigated were cow's milk, hen's egg, peanut, hazelnut, and shrimp. The components with the highest diagnostic accuracy for each allergen, along with their sensitivity-specificity pairs, were as follows: Bos d 4 for cow's milk (62.0\% and 87.5\%), Gal d 1 for hen's egg (84.2\% and 89.8\% for heated egg, and 60.6\% and 97.1\% for raw egg), Ara h 6 for peanut (94.9\% and 95.1\%), Cor a 14 for hazelnut (100\% and 93.8\%), and Lit v 1 for shrimp (82.8\% and 56.3\%) allergy. CONCLUSION: Selected components of cow's milk, hen's egg, peanut, hazelnut, and shrimp allergen showed high specificity, but lower sensitivity. However, few studies exist for each component, and studies vary widely regarding the cutoff values used, making it challenging to synthesize findings across studies. Further research is needed to determine clinically appropriate cutoff values, risk assessment abilities, and cost-effectiveness of CRD approaches.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The concept of anaesthesia-related neonatal neurotoxicity originated in neonatal rodent models, yet prospective clinical studies have largely not supported this concern. OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency and magnitude of hypercarbia, hypoxia and death in rodent models of neonatal anaesthetic toxicity and neurodevelopmental delay. DESIGN: Systematic review of published rodent studies of neonatal anaesthesia neurotoxicity. We documented anaesthetic, route, dose, frequency and duration of exposures. We further report ventilation method, documentation of adequacy of ventilation [arterial blood gas (ABG), other], mortality and the reporting of mortality. DATA SOURCES: A PubMed literature search from 2003 to 2017 was conducted to identify studies on neurotoxicity in neonatal rodent models. ELIGIBILITY: Studies were included when at least one group of animals fell within the postnatal age range of 3 to 15 days. Only English language original studies published as full-length articles in peer reviewed journals were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: One hundred and three manuscripts were included. Ninety-eight percent of studies were conducted using spontaneous ventilation (101/103), with ABG monitoring used in only 33\% of studies and visual monitoring alone for respiratory distress or cyanosis was employed in 60\%. Of the 33\% who reported ABG results, there were widely divergent values, with most reporting modest-to-severe hypercarbia. Mortality (median 11\%, range of 0 to 40\%), which infers severe hypoxia, was documented in only 36/103 (35\%) reports. CONCLUSION: Hypoxia and hypercarbia have known apoptotic effects on developing brains. Hence, the inadequate control of hypercarbia and hypoxia in neonatal rodent models of anaesthetic exposure during spontaneous ventilation suggests that the evidence for developmental delay and neurotoxicity attributed to anaesthesia may not be valid in humans.},

The key questions posed were: To what extent can current scientific knowledge inform a sensor-based approach to welfare evaluations? And, how might this knowledge shape development of commercial monitoring systems? These questions were explored through retrospective classification of published sensor applications using The Five Domains (FD) Model as a framework for animal welfare assessment. A total of 71 studies were reviewed. The results indicate studies specifically evaluating the use of sensors for welfare assessment are limited, though many experiments could still be related to some aspect of welfare. The assessment of sensor utilisation revealed the greatest proportion of applications within the 'Behaviour' Domain (90.1\%; n=64), and the lowest within the 'Health' (25.4\%; n=18) and 'Mental state' Domains (25.4\%; n=18). The review also highlights how different sensor types (location, motion or physiological) differ in their applicability for welfare assessment. This paper is the first to classify published sensor applications using the FD Model as a framework and highlights the potential for sensor technology in sheep welfare monitoring. The results suggest that any attempt to create a commercial sensor-based system for objective welfare assessment will require the integration of more than one sensor type, particularly if multiple Domains are to be addressed.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12931-019-1267-8},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: While porcine seems to be superior to bovine surfactants in terms of respiratory outcomes, it is unclear if a surfactant can improve extra-pulmonary outcomes in preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome and if there is any physiopathological/biological mechanism linking surfactant therapy to these outcomes. We aim to fill these knowledge gaps. METHODS: Systematic and pragmatic review coupled with meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of bovine or porcine surfactants administered to treat RDS in preterm neonates; common extra-pulmonary neonatal intensive care outcomes were considered. As additional analysis, animal or human translational studies about mechanisms linking surfactant replacement to extra-pulmonary neonatal outcomes were also systematically reviewed. RESULTS: Porcine surfactant is associated with lower incidence of patent ductus arteriosus (OR:0.655; 95\%CI:0.460-0.931); p = 0.018; 12 trials; 1472 patients); prenatal steroids (coeff.:-0.009, 95\%CI:-0.03-0.009, p = 0.323) and gestational age (coeff.:0.079, 95\%CI:-0.18-0.34, p = 0.554) did not influence this effect size. No significant differences were found between porcine and bovine surfactants on neonatal intensive care unit length of stay (mean difference (days):-2.977; 95\%CI:-6.659-0.705; p = 0.113; 8 trials; 855 patients), intra-ventricular hemorrhage of any grade (OR:0.860; 95\%CI:0.648-1.139); p = 0.293; 15 trials; 1703 patients), severe intra-ventricular hemorrhage (OR:0.852; 95\%CI:0.624-1.163); p = 0.313; 15 trials; 1672 patients), necrotizing entero-colitis (OR:1.190; 95\%CI:0.785-1.803); p = 0.412; 9 trials; 1097 patients) and retinopathy of prematurity (OR:0.801; 95\%CI:0.480-1.337); p = 0.396; 10 trials; 962 patients). CONCLUSIONS: Physiopathological mechanisms explaining the effect of surfactant have been found for patent ductus arteriosus only, while they are lacking for all other endpoints. Porcine surfactant is associated with lower incidence of PDA than bovine surfactants. As there are no differences in terms of other extra-pulmonary outcomes and no physiopathological plausibility, these endpoints should not be used in future trials.

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review. SAMPLE: English-language articles describing soft tissue and oncologic surgeries in client-owned dogs and cats published in peer-reviewed journals from 2013 to 2016. METHODS: CAB, AGRICOLA, and MEDLINE databases were searched for eligible articles. Article characteristics relevant to complications were abstracted and summarized, including reported events, definitions, criteria used to classify events according to severity and time frame, and relevant citations. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-one articles involving 10 522 animals were included. Canine retrospective case series of dogs predominated. Ninety-two percent of articles mentioned complications in study results, but only 7.3\% defined the term complication. Articles commonly described complications according to time frame and severity, but terminology and classification criteria were highly variable, conflicting between studies, or not provided. Most (58\%) reported complications could have been graded with a published veterinary adverse event classification scheme, although common intraoperative complications were notable exceptions. CONCLUSION: Definitions and criteria used to classify and report soft tissue and oncologic surgical complications are often absent, incomplete, or contradictory among studies. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Lack of consistent terminology contributes to inadequate communication of important information about surgical complications. Standardization of terminology and consistency in severity scoring will improve comparative evaluation of clinical research results.},

	abstract = {Reduced bull fertility imposes economic losses in bovine herds. Specifically, testicular and spermatic traits are important indicators of reproductive efficiency. Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified genomic regions associated with these fertility traits. The aims of this study were as follows: 1) to perform a systematic review of GWAS results for spermatic and testicular traits in cattle and 2) to identify key functional candidate genes for these traits. The identification of functional candidate genes was performed using a systems biology approach, where genes shared between traits and studies were evaluated by a guilt by association gene prioritization (GUILDify and ToppGene software) in order to identify the best functional candidates. These candidate genes were integrated and analyzed in order to identify overlapping patterns among traits and breeds. Results showed that GWAS for testicular-related traits have been developed for beef breeds only, whereas the majority of GWAS for spermatic-related traits were conducted using dairy breeds. When comparing traits measured within the same study, the highest number of genes shared between different traits was observed, indicating a high impact of the population genetic structure and environmental effects. Several chromosomal regions were enriched for functional candidate genes associated with fertility traits. Moreover, multiple functional candidate genes were enriched for markers in a species-specific basis, taurine (Bos taurus) or indicine (Bos indicus). For the different candidate regions identified in the GWAS in the literature, functional candidate genes were detected as follows: B. Taurus chromosome X (BTX) (TEX11, IRAK, CDK16, ATP7A, ATRX, HDAC6, FMR1, L1CAM, MECP2, etc.), BTA17 (TRPV4 and DYNLL1), and BTA14 (MOS, FABP5, ZFPM2). These genes are responsible for regulating important metabolic pathways or biological processes associated with fertility, such as progression of spermatogenesis, control of ciliary activity, development of Sertoli cells, DNA integrity in spermatozoa, and homeostasis of testicular cells. This study represents the first systematic review on male fertility traits in cattle using a system biology approach to identify key candidate genes for these traits.},

	abstract = {Cats are one of the world's most populous companion animals, yet little is known about how the home environment is adapted relative to their needs. Outdoor access is thought to be beneficial for both the physical and mental wellbeing of cats, yet as urbanisation increases, reducing owner access to outdoor spaces, an increasing number of cats are kept strictly indoors. The impact of an indoor lifestyle on feline behaviour and welfare is little explored and poorly understood. This study used a systematic review to assess scientifically validated knowledge concerning social and physical environments and their implications for indoor cats. A total of 61 papers were analysed. Only n=21 papers directly addressed at-home indoor scenarios with the remainder consisting of shelter/cattery (n=27) or laboratory (n=16) (some papers explored multiple environments). Across studies there was little evidence of rigour or systematically controlled approaches. Methods frequently used were cat-stress-scores (CSS) and ethograms, neither of which were consistently standardised, substantially reducing the ability to compare findings among studies. Numerous studies explored similar variables (i.e. provision of hiding space (n=9)) yielding little additional knowledge. Measures of welfare and behaviour were often assessed using single parameters in controlled environments. Although this may be useful and applicable to cat experiences within shelters, catteries and laboratories, the findings do not necessarily translate to dynamic and variable household environments. Major findings include the benefits of enrichment such as hiding boxes and vertical resting spaces, as often recommended by veterinarians and feline charities. However, other advice provided, such as the provision of feeding enrichment for psychological welfare, although not necessarily disputed, appears to be scientifically untested. Additionally, despite the social environment being likely to have a substantial effect on cat welfare, it is particularly under-studied in the home, especially in terms of its complexity (e.g. presence of young children or dogs). Overall, the review identified substantial gaps relative to cat experiences and welfare in multifactorial home environments. Understanding the impact of indoor lifestyles and promoting mechanisms to minimise any negative impacts whilst promoting positive ones, remains an important, yet underexplored, area of research.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasmosis, caused by the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii, is an important disease with worldwide distribution. Infection can occur from ingesting raw or undercooked infected meat, and among food animal species, pork is known to be one of the main sources of meat-borne infection. Here, we present results of the first systematic review and meta-analysis on the global T. gondii seroprevalence in pigs. PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and EMBASE databases were comprehensively searched for relevant studies published between January 1, 1990 and October 25, 2018. We used a random effects model to calculate pooled seroprevalence estimates with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) and analyzed data from five continents. We also conducted subgroup and meta-regression analyses to evaluate the effects of geographical and climate variables on pooled seroprevalence rates. Among 1542 publications identified, 148 studies containing 150 datasets were included in the meta-analysis, and comprised 148,092 pigs from 47 countries. The pooled global T. gondii seroprevalence in pigs was estimated to be 19\% (95\%CI, 17-22\%; 23,696/148,092), with the lowest seroprevalence in Europe (13\%; 10-15\%) and highest seroprevalence in Africa (25\%; 17-34\%) and North America (25\%; 19-33\%). The seropositivity rates in Asia and South America regions were (21\%, 16-26\%) and (23\%; 17-30\%), respectively. A significantly higher T. gondii seroprevalence was associated with higher mean annual temperature and lower geographical latitude. The presence of cats on farms was identified as a potential risk factor for T. gondii seropositivity (OR, 1.41; 95\%CI, 1.00-2.02). Our findings highlight the importance of pigs as a possible source of human T. gondii infections.},

METHODS: English and French published articles indexed in EBSCOhost, PubMed, Web of Science, and African Journals Online were retrieved, with searches being conducted up to August, 2015. Data were pooled and meta-analysis performed using a random-effects model, and the results are described as event rates. RESULTS: According to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 17 articles out of the 852 retrieved were eligible for the qualitative and quantitative analysis. The studies included were mainly conducted in Nigeria, with Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Campylobacter spp. being the main bacteria. The pooled estimates showed high level of antibiotic resistance (ABR) (86\%; p {\textless} 0.001) and multidrug resistance (73\%; p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that ABR is substantively prevalent and poses a serious threat for food safety and security in Africa. These findings shed light on areas for future research concerning antibiotic-resistant and multidrug-resistant bacteria in food animals as etiological agents of infectious diseases in humans. They further yielded some interesting findings on the burden of ABR that could be useful in developing measures to contain this threat in the farm-to-plate continuum in Africa.},

	abstract = {A bibliometric analysis was undertaken to chart the development of animal welfare (AW) science as a whole, and of the individuals, organisations and countries that have had most academic impact to date. Publication data were collected from the Web of Science for the year range 1968-2017 and by-hand pre-processing of the data was undertaken to identify reviews and original research articles on AW. VOSviewer was used to create bibliometric networks. There has been a 13.3\% annual growth in AW publications in the last 50 years with Animal Welfare and Applied Animal Behaviour Science the most frequent publishers of AW publications. Farm animals continue to dominate the subject of AW research and comparison of network visualisations for five key species suggested possible gaps in the research, such as relatively little emphasis on emotion research for some farm animals and little research on inherited disorders in dogs. However, keyword analysis indicated a recent broadening of AW findings to include other international contexts, such as conservation and sustainability. Highly cited review articles were grouped into five clusters with affective state (ie emotions, moods) and fish welfare the most recent topics. Almost all core authors of original research articles study farm animals, though in the last ten years other topics, such as consumer attitudes and wildlife, have emerged as highly cited areas of original research articles. Network analysis of organisations revealed the University of Bristol, UK as the main publisher of original research articles. Citation analysis indicated that many low-cited articles were originating from Germany and were published in German journals, suggesting that many worthwhile results and opinions on AW may be being missed by other researchers due to a language barrier. Several limitations of bibliometric analysis to generate an overview of AW science were identified, including the challenge of how to search and extract all the relevant publications in this discipline. In conclusion, animal welfare science is still in an exponential phase of growth which will bring opportunities, such as for the publication of new journals, but also challenges. The insights generated by this study suggest bibliometric analysis to be a useful addition to other approaches investigating the trends and concepts of animal welfare.},

	abstract = {Histological grading systems remain cornerstones in the prognosis of canine cutaneous mast cell tumours (MCTs), but the distinct biological behaviour of each tumour often necessitates the use of complementary markers. Although a plethora of immunohistochemical markers have been proposed as prognostic factors, few are presently applied in routine diagnosis. This systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to establish which immunohistochemical markers have verifiable prognostic value for cutaneous MCTs in dogs. A Boolean search of five databases identified 200 articles for screening, of which 73 were selected for full-text assessment and 24 ultimately included in the systematic review. Odds Ratio (OR) was adopted as the summary measure for subsequent meta-analysis but only 15 articles, relating to the immunomarkers Ki-67 (9), KIT (5), and BAX (2), provided either a value for OR or sufficient data to calculate this statistic. Meta-analysis verified that canine cutaneous MCTs with elevated expression of Ki-67 or BAX, as well aberrant immuno-expression of KIT, showed an increased odds of death, with respective OR values of 11.2 (95\% CI 6.3-20.0; p {\textless} .01), 9.9 (95\% CI 1.3-73.6; p = .03), and 4.1 (95\% CI 1.1-15.3; p = .03). Despite KIT, Ki67, and BAX arise as suitable prognostic factor for canine MCTs, this study highlighted the lack of important clinical and statistical data in many published articles, rendering it impossible to complete the meta-analysis of several potentially valuable immunohistochemical markers.},

We identified 14 studies: 8 that evaluated propofol, 5 that evaluated fentanyl, and 2 that evaluated midazolam. All studies suffered from significant limitations, including: small sample size, and heterogeneous design and measurement techniques. In general, there was no significant change seen in CBF/cerebrovascular response to administration of propofol, fentanyl, or midazolam during experiments where PCO(2) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were controlled. This review highlights the current knowledge gap surrounding the impact of commonly utilized sedative drugs in TBI care.

Healthy animals and those undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in CBF with NE administration. However, animal models and human patients with acquired brain injury had varied responses in CBF to NE administration. The animal models indicate an increase in cerebral vasoconstriction with NE administration through the alpha receptors in vessels.

Subsequent to the primary mechanical damage, progressive secondary damage further exacerbates the functional deficit. Demyelination may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SCI. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) are considered a candidate cellular treatment approach for SCI attributable to their unique potential. Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of OPC transplantation in rat models with traumatic thoracic SCI, and 17 studies (20 experiments, 402 rats) were identified. The Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan (BBB) locomotor rating score, latency and amplitude of motor evoked potential (MEP), percentage of myelinated axons, and cavity size were used as outcome measurements. The pooled results of the meta-analysis in different subgroups (based on cell dose or sex) both suggested that the BBB score of the OPC group was significantly improved compared to that of the control group 2, 4, and 8 weeks after transplantation. Whereas the amplitude of MEP was not significantly different, the latency of MEP was significantly shorter compared to that of the control group 4 weeks after transplantation. The percentage of myelinated axons increased significantly in the OPC group compared to that of the control group after OPC transplantation. Area measurements across groups revealed a significant reduction in cavity size in the OPC-treated groups compared to the control group. In conclusion, OPC transplantation provided considerable beneficial effects after traumatic SCI.},

	abstract = {Background: Dingoes and wild-living dogs in Australia, which include feral domestic dogs and dingo-dog hybrids, play a role as reservoirs of disease. In the case of an exotic disease incursion-such as rabies-these reservoirs could be a threat to the health of humans, domestic animals and other wildlife in Australia. Disease spread models are needed to explore this impact and develop mitigation strategies for responding to an incursion. Our study aim was to describe relevant information from the literature, using a scoping review, on specific topics related to dingo and wild-living dog ecology and biology (topics of interest) in Australia to inform parameterisation of disease spread modelling and identify major research gaps. Methods: A broad electronic search was conducted in five bibliographic databases and grey literature. Two levels of screening and two levels of data extraction were each performed independently by two reviewers. Data extracted included topics of interest investigated, type of population sampled, the presence of lethal control, type of environment, years of collection and GPS coordinates of study sites. Results: From 1666 records captured, the screening process yielded 229 individual studies published between 1862 and 2016. The most frequently reported topics of interest in studies were index of abundance (n = 93) and diet (n = 68). Among the three key parameters in disease spread modelling (i.e., density, contacts and home range), data on density and contacts were identified as major research gaps in the literature due to the small number of recent studies on these topics and the scarcity of quantitative estimates. The research reviewed was mostly located around central Australia and the east coast, including a few studies on density, contacts and home range. Data from these regions could potentially be used to inform parameterisation for disease spread modelling of dingoes and wild-living dogs. However, the number of studies is limited in equatorial and tropical climate zones of northern Australia, which is a high-risk area for a rabies incursion. Conclusions: Research in northern regions of Australia, especially to generate data regarding density, contacts and home ranges, should be prioritised for future research on dingoes and wild-living dogs.},

The colonization of different animal reservoirs by Campylobacter poses an important risk for humans through shedding of the pathogen in livestock waste and contamination of water sources, environment, and food. A review of published articles was conducted to obtain information on the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles of thermophilic Campylobacter species in humans and animals in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Electronic databases, namely, PubMed, Google Scholar, Research4life-HINARI Health, and Researchgate.net, were searched using the following search terms "thermophilic Campylobacter," "Campylobacter jejuni," "Campylobacter coli," "diarrhea/diarrhoea," "antimicrobial resistance," "antibiotic resistance," "humans," "animals," "Sub-Saharan Africa," and "a specific country name." Initially, a total of 614 articles were identified, and the lists of references were screened in which 22 more articles were identified. After screening, 33 articles on humans and 34 on animals and animal products were included in this review. In humans, Nigeria reported the highest prevalence (62.7\%), followed by Malawi (21\%) and South Africa (20.3\%). For Campylobacter infections in under-five children, Kenya reported 16.4\%, followed by Rwanda (15.5\%) and Ethiopia (14.5\%). The country-level mean prevalence in all ages and under-five children was 18.6\% and 9.4\%, respectively. The prevalence ranged from 1.7\%-62.7\% in humans and 1.2\%-80\% in animals. The most reported species were C. jejuni and C. coli. The AMR to commonly used antimicrobials ranged from 0-100\% in both humans and animals. Poultry consumption and drinking surface water were the main risk factors for campylobacteriosis. The present review provides evidence of thermophilic Campylobacter occurrence in humans and animals and high levels of AMR in SSA, emphasizing the need for strengthening both national and regional multisectoral antimicrobial resistance standard surveillance protocols to curb both the campylobacteriosis burden and increase of antimicrobial resistance in the region.},

	abstract = {STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: The performance of the autogenous bone ring (ABR) technique used for the vertical bone augmentation procedure has not yet been determined. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate whether the ABR technique for the vertical bone augmentation procedure with simultaneous implant placement enhances the histologic and histomorphometric outcomes in surgically created bone defects in animal models. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An electronic search of 3 databases, Medline/PubMed, Science Direct, Lilacs, and a manual search of a reference list of relevant studies were performed. Only animal studies regarding vertical bone augmentation by using the ABR technique with simultaneous implant placement in surgically created bone defects were included in the review. The SYstematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experimentation tool was used to determine the risk of bias assessment, and the quality of included studies was assessed by using the Animal Research: Reporting in Vivo Experiments guidelines. RESULTS: Five studies were included in the qualitative analysis based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. One study comparing the ABR technique with the bovine and biphasic ring reported a high percentage of bone area and bone implant contact of the ABR at 5 weeks of osseointegration. Similar histologic findings were reported in another study at 4 months of healing, but contrasting data were reported at 8 months. Another study reported an increase in the percentage of bone area and bone implant contact of the ABR technique from 3 months to 6 months of osseointegration. Two studies reported an increase in the percentage of bone area, and 1 study reported a decrease in the mean of bone implant contact, both with simultaneous and staged implant procedures. CONCLUSION: Based on the limited available studies, the use of the ABR technique for the vertical bone augmentation procedure with simultaneous implant placement presented optimal histologic and histomorphometric outcomes in surgically created bone defects in animal models. However, the results of the current review are not sufficiently robust to support the use of the ABR technique for vertical bone augmentation in humans.},

	abstract = {Introduction: A phenomenon of decreasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among fecal bacteria as food animals age has been noted in multiple field studies. We conducted a scoping review to summarize the extent, range, and nature of research activity and the data for the following question: "does AMR among enteric/fecal bacteria predictably shift as animals get older?". Methods: This review followed a scoping review methodology framework. Pertinent literature published up until November 2018 for all animals (except humans) was retrieved using keyword searches in two online databases, namely, PubMed® and the Web of Science™ Core Collection, without filtering publication date, geographic location, or language. Data were extracted from the included studies, summarized, and plotted. Study quality was also assessed using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines for all included papers. Results: The publications with detailed relevant data (n = 62) in food animals, poultry, and dogs were identified. These included longitudinal studies (n = 32), cross-sectional studies of different age groups within one food animal production system or small-animal catchment area (n = 16), and experimental or diet trials (n = 14). A decline in host-level prevalence and/or within-host abundance of AMR among fecal bacteria in production beef, dairy cattle, and swine was reported in nearly two-thirds (65\%) of the identified studies in different geographic locations from the 1970's to 2018. Mixed results, with AMR abundance among fecal bacteria either increasing or decreasing with age, have been reported in poultry (broiler chicken, layer, and grow-out turkey) and dogs. Conclusions: Quantitative synthesis of the data suggests that the age-dependent AMR phenomenon in cattle and swine is observed irrespective of geographic location and specific production practices. It is unclear whether the phenomenon predates or is related to antimicrobial drug use. However, almost 50\% of the identified studies predate recent changes in antimicrobial drug use policy and regulations in food animals in the United States and elsewhere.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0206520},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Projected temperature rise in the upcoming years due to climate change has increased interest in studying the effects of heat stress in dairy cows. Environmental indices are commonly used for detecting heat stress, but have been used mainly in studies focused on the productivity-related effects of heat stress. The welfare approach involves identifying physiological and behavioural measurements so as to start heat stress mitigation protocols before the appearance of impending severe health or production issues. Therefore, there is growing interest in studying the effects of heat stress on welfare. This systematic review seeks to summarise the animal-based responses to heat stress (physiological and behavioural, excluding productivity) that have been used in scientific literature. METHODS: Using systematic review guidelines set by PRISMA, research articles were identified, screened and summarised based on inclusion criteria for physiology and behaviour, excluding productivity, for animal-based resilience indicators. 129 published articles were reviewed to determine which animal-based indicators for heat stress were most frequently used in dairy cows. RESULTS: The articles considered report at least 212 different animal-based indicators that can be aggregated into body temperature, feeding, physiological response, resting, drinking, grazing and pasture-related behaviour, reactions to heat management and others. The most common physiological animal-based indicators are rectal temperature, respiration rate and dry matter intake, while the most common behavioural indicators are time spent lying, standing and feeding. CONCLUSION: Although body temperature and respiration rate are the animal-based indicators most frequently used to assess heat stress in dairy cattle, when choosing an animal-based indicator for detecting heat stress using scientific literature to establish thresholds, characteristics that influence the scale of the response and the definition of heat stress must be taken into account, e.g. breed, lactation stage, milk yield, system type, climate region, bedding type, diet and cooling management strategies.},

	abstract = {Land-use change modifies the spatial structure of terrestrial landscapes, potentially shaping the distribution, abundance and diversity of remaining species assemblages. Non-human primates can be particularly vulnerable to landscape disturbances, but our understanding of this topic is far from complete. Here we reviewed all available studies on primates' responses to landscape structure. We found 34 studies of 71 primate species (24 genera and 10 families) that used a landscape approach. Most studies (82\%) were from Neotropical forests, with howler monkeys being the most frequently studied taxon (56\% of studies). All studies but one used a site-landscape or a patch-landscape study design, and frequently (34\% of studies) measured landscape variables within a given radius from the edge of focal patches. Altogether, the 34 studies reported 188 responses to 17 landscape-scale metrics. However, the majority of the studies (62\%) quantified landscape predictors within a single spatial scale, potentially missing significant primate-landscape responses. To assess such responses accurately, landscape metrics need to be measured at the optimal scale, i.e. the spatial extent at which the primate-landscape relationship is strongest (so-called 'scale of effect'). Only 21\% of studies calculated the scale of effect through multiscale approaches. Interestingly, the vast majority of studies that do not assess the scale of effect mainly reported null effects of landscape structure on primates, while most of the studies based on optimal scales found significant responses. These significant responses were primarily to landscape composition variables rather than landscape configuration variables. In particular, primates generally show positive responses to increasing forest cover, landscape quality indices and matrix permeability. By contrast, primates show weak responses to landscape configuration. In addition, half of the studies showing significant responses to landscape configuration metrics did not control for the effect of forest cover. As configuration metrics are often correlated with forest cover, this means that documented configuration effects may simply be driven by landscape-scale forest loss. Our findings suggest that forest loss (not fragmentation) is a major threat to primates, and thus, preventing deforestation (e.g. through creation of reserves) and increasing forest cover through restoration is critically needed to mitigate the impact of land-use change on our closest relatives. Increasing matrix functionality can also be critical, for instance by promoting anthropogenic land covers that are similar to primates' habitat.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasmosis is one of the most frequent food-borne infections in humans caused by an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. Rodents, as intermediate and reservoir hosts, play key role in the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis; because they are the main source of infection for the Felidae family members and establish the parasite life cycle. Hence, the infectious isolates of T. gondii in rodents may be the main genotypes infecting the environment, humans and animals. Our review aimed to present the population structure of T. gondii in these mammals. To access the relevant studies, six English language databases were systematically searched from 1990 to 2019. Finally, 3,395 samples of rodents were analysed for the genotyping data and 118 isolates were separated from the samples. The results of the present study showed that atypical genotypes were dominant with a frequency of 65.2\% of the total isolates (77 out of 118). Clonal Types II, III and I had less frequency, respectively. Type I clonal isolates were identified only from Asia. The examination of genotypes circulating in rodents around the world revealed that ToxoDB \#1 or \#3 (Type II) were the most common, followed by ToxoDB \#9 and \#2, respectively. Overall, our data showed low genetic diversity of T. gondii with circulating clonal strains in rodents compare to the isolates from Europe, North America and Africa, while non-clonal parasites with high genetic diversity were dominant in South America and Asia.},

Rodents, as intermediate and reservoir hosts, play a key role in the maintenance and transmission of T. gondii. They can be contaminated and maintain the parasite in the form of cysts in their bodies, demonstrating an infection source for their offsprings, predators (particularly felids), and other animals. Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis study was carried out to evaluate the global seroprevalence of T. gondii in these mammals. For achieving the purpose of the current study, six English databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, and Google Scholar) were systematically searched for related studies from 1970 to 2018. Finally, a total of 52,372 records were screened, 105 records including 26,221 rodents were incorporated in the present study. By random effect models, the overall seroprevalence was calculated at 6\% (95\% CI = 6-7\%), with the highest amount was observed in Africa (24\%) and South America (18\%), and the lowest amount in Europe (1\%). The subgroup data analysis by gender manifested that the prevalence of Immunoglobulin G antibodies did not differ between genders (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Due to the significant heterogeneity, meta-regression models were applied based on serological techniques and continental regions; however, the obtained values were not statistically significant (P = 0.480 and P = 0.295, respectively). The present study revealed a relatively low level of T. gondii seroprevalence in rodents; however, if they were the main food source for their predators, they would cause high transmission of T. gondii.},

	abstract = {Hypoxia in aquatic ecosystems is often a result of anthropogenic activities, such as increased nutrient loading, originating from agriculture or urbanization, as well as global warming. Aquatic invertebrates are especially important in ecosystems due to their central role in secondary production and in dynamics of food webs. To better understand impacts of oxygen availability on key physiological processes in invertebrates, we conducted a literature search and synthesized the findings of published studies. We found 55 studies that quantified impacts of hypoxia on feeding, growth, reproduction and respiration rates in 54 different aquatic invertebrate species. We applied non-linear regression models which took into account phylogenetic correlation in the data set. Fitting Michaelis-Menten models, we found that there were differences in how different processes responded to a decline in oxygen availability. Respiration rates were halved at highest oxygen concentration (6.44 mg O(2)/L), followed by reproductive (3.66 mg O(2)/L), growth (1.77 mg O(2)/L) and, finally, feeding rates (0.77 mg O(2)/L). Our findings confirm observations that reproduction is highly sensitive as organisms quickly reduce their reproductive output when exposed to stressful conditions. As long as they have sufficient reserves, organisms continue growing even under stressful conditions, and we confirmed that growth was not very sensitive to a decline in oxygen availability. We discuss potential impacts of global warming on oxygen availability and demand for aquatic macroinvertebrates. Given that oxygen availability is declining in many ecosystems, we can expect that organismal responses will be increasingly compromised with potential consequences for ecosystems and the services they deliver.},

	abstract = {Background Asthma is one of the most common chronic inflammatory conditions of the lungs in modern society. Asthma is associated with airway hyperresponsiveness and remodeling of the airways, with typical symptoms of cough, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness. Interleukins (IL) play an integral role in its inflammatory pathogenesis. Medicinal herbs and secondary metabolites are gaining considerable attention due to their potential therapeutic role and pharmacological mechanisms as adjunct tools to synthetic bronchodilator drugs. Purpose To systematically review the literature on the use of single or mixed plants extracts therapy in vivo experimental systems for asthma, emphasizing their regulations on IL production to improve lung. Methods Literature searches were performed on PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science databases. All articles in English were extracted from 1999 up to September 2019, assessed critically for data extraction. Studies investigating the effectiveness and safety of plant extracts administered; inflammatory cell count, immunoglobulin E (IgE) production and regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine and T helper (Th) 1 and Th2-driven cytokine expression in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung of asthmatic animals were included. Results Four hundred and eighteen publications were identified and 51 met the inclusion criteria. Twenty-six studies described bioactive compounds from plant extracts. The most frequent immunopharmacological mechanisms described included reduction in IgE and eosinophilic recruitment, decreased mucus hypersecretion and airway hyperreactivity, enhancement of the balance of Th1/Th2 cytokine ratio, suppression of matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and reversal of structural alterations. Conclusion Plant extract therapies have potential control activities on asthma symptoms by modulating the secretion of pro-inflammatory (IL-1beta, IL-8), Th17 (IL-17), anti-inflammatory (IL-10, IL-23, IL-31, IL-33), Th1 (IL-2, IL-12) and Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13) cytokines, reducing the level of biomarkers of airway inflammation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Flavonoids are naturally occurring compounds, extensively distributed in plants. T helper (Th)1 and Th2 cytokines balance plays an essential role in the reaction of inflammatory, allergic and infectious processes and transplantation rejection. PURPOSE: This systematic review focuses on various classes of flavonoids with a view to evaluate whether Th1/Th2 cytokine-mediated pathways of immunoenhancement could reduce immune overwhelming reactions. METHODS: Articles in English published from inception to December 2017 reporting flavonoids with immunomodulatory activity for the management of immune-mediated disorders were acquired from PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science and a animal experiments where Th1 and Th2 cytokines were investigated to assess the outcome of immunoregulatory therapy were included. CHAPTERS: 1809 publications were identified and 26 were included in this review. Ten articles described the effect of flavonoids on allergic inflammation in an animal model of asthma; eleven in vivo studies evaluated the immunomodulating and immunosuppressive effects of flavonoids on Th1/Th2 cytokines production and five reports described the regulatory role of flavonoids for Th1/Th2 cytokine responses to experimental arthritis and myocarditis. Modulation of Th1/Th2 cytokine balance, inhibition of eosinophil accumulation and remodeling of the airways and lungs, downregulation of Notch and PI3K signaling pathways, regulation of CD4 + /CD8 + lymphocytes ratio and decreasing inflammatory mediator expressions levels are among the most important immunopharmacological mechanisms for the retrieved flavonoids. CONCLUSION: Naturally occurring flavonoids discussed in the present article have optimal immunomodulation to prevent immune-mediated disorders through management of Th1/Th2 cytokine balance.},

OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to assess the associations between exposure to cats or dogs and the development of asthma and allergic rhinitis. METHODS: A systematic review was performed to identify case-control and cohort studies before May 2019, evaluating the association between exposure to cats and dogs and the risk of asthma and rhinitis. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The odds ratios (ORs) and risk ratios (RRs) were pooled for case-control and cohort studies, respectively. Subgroup analyses were performed on prespecified study-level characteristics. RESULTS: The meta-analysis of 34 cohort studies showed a protective role of exposure to cats [RR: 0.88, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.77-0.99] or dogs (RR: 0.85, 95\% CI: 0.73-0.97) in the development of asthma. The subgroup analysis of birth cohort (RR: 0.74, 95\% CI: 0.56-0.93) and children population (RR: 0.83, 95\% CI: 0.70-0.96) also suggested a favorable role of exposure to dogs in the development of asthma. Pooled evidence from 13 case-control studies indicated no significant impact of cats (OR: 1.66, 95\% CI: 0.39-2.94) and dogs (OR: 1.22, 95\% CI: 0.92-1.52) on the development of asthma. A pooled analysis of five cohort studies showed a favorable effect of exposure to cats (RR: 0.60, 95\% CI: 0.33-0.86) or dogs (RR: 0.68, 95\% CI 0.44-0.90) on the development of allergic rhinitis.

The research filters were constructed using three parameters: flavonoids, hepatocellular carcinoma, and animal model. The bias analysis of the 34 selected works was done using the ARRIVE guidelines. The most widely used flavonoid in the studies was epigallocatechin gallate extracted from green tea. In general, the treatment with different flavonoids presented inhibition of tumor growth and antiangiogenic, antimetastatic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. The bias analysis evidenced the absence of methodological processes in all studies, such as the age or weight of the animals, the method of flavonoids' extraction, or the experimental designs, analytical methods, and outcome measures.

The highest possible score was 9 (using the NOS). Six studies complied with all NOS criteria. The animal model has been seen to influence the results, leading to failure in some cases. The most used animal model on VAOD, with fewer complications, was the Mongrel dog. The use of the pig and minipig is not recommended, due to the difficulties in handling and complications encountered.},

Objective: We aimed to establish whether resuscitation with air during chest compression is feasible and safe in newborn infants compared with 100\% oxygen. Methods: Systematic search of PubMed, Google Scholar and CINAHL for articles examining variable oxygen concentrations during chest compressions in term newborns. Results: Overall, no human studies but eight animal studies (n = 323 animals) comparing various oxygen concentrations during chest compression were identified. The pooled analysis showed no difference in mortality rates for animals resuscitated with air vs. 100\% oxygen (risk ratio 1.04 [0.35, 3.08], I(2) = 0\%, p = 0.94). ROSC was also similar between groups with a mean difference of -3.8 [-29.7-22] s, I(2) = 0\%, p = 0.77. No difference in oxygen damage or adverse events were identified between groups. Conclusions: Air had similar time to ROSC and mortality as 100\% oxygen during neonatal chest compression. A large randomized controlled clinical trial comparing air vs. 100\% oxygen during neonatal chest compression is warranted.},

Ninety of the studies were observational and the remaining nine were experimental. We summarize characteristics of animal studies including study design, study population and outcomes of interest for future transmission modelling in the reservoir population.

	abstract = {Yogurt is a good source of probiotics, calcium, and proteins, but its content of vitamin D is low. Therefore, yogurt could be a good choice for vitamin D fortification to improve the positive health outcomes associated with its consumption. The primary aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effect of vitamin D-fortified yogurt compared with plain yogurt on levels of serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD). The secondary aim was to evaluate the effect of fortified yogurt on parathyroid hormone, anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, glucose metabolism, and lipid profile. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar for eligible studies; that is, randomized controlled trials (RCT) that compared vitamin D-fortified yogurt with control treatment without any additional supplement. Random-effects models were used to estimate pooled effect sizes and 95\% confidence intervals. Findings from 9 RCT (n = 665 participants) that lasted from 8 to 16 wk are summarized in this review. The meta-analyzed mean differences for random effects showed that vitamin D-fortified yogurt (from 400 to 2,000 IU) increased serum 25OHD by 31.00 nmol/L. In addition, vitamin D-fortified yogurt decreased parathyroid hormone by 15.47 ng/L, body weight by 0.92 kg, waist circumference by 2.01 cm, HOMA-IR by 2.18 mass units, fasting serum glucose by 22.54 mg/dL, total cholesterol by 13.38 mg/dL, and triglycerides by 30.12 mg/dL compared with the controlled treatments. No publication bias was identified. Considerable between-study heterogeneity was observed for most outcomes. Vitamin D-fortified yogurt may be beneficial in improving serum 25OHD, lipid profile, glucose metabolism, and anthropometric parameters and decreasing parathyroid hormone level in pregnant women and adult and elderly subjects with or without diabetes, prediabetes, or metabolic syndrome.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many studies are investigating the role of living and nonliving models to train microsurgeons. There is controversy around which modalities account for the best microsurgical training. In this study, we aim to provide a systematic literature review of the practical modalities in microsurgery training and compare the living and nonliving models, emphasizing the superiority of the former. We introduce the concept of non-technical skill acquisition in microsurgical training with the use of living laboratory animals in the context of a novel proposed curriculum. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on PubMed/Medline and Scopus within the past 11 years based on a combination of the following keywords: "microsurgery," "training," "skills," and "models." The online screening process was performed by two independent reviewers with the Covidence tool. A total of 101 papers was identified as relevant to our study. The protocol was reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. RESULTS: Living models offer the chance to develop both technical and non-technical competencies (i.e., leadership, situation awareness, decision-making, communication, and teamwork). Prior experience with ex vivo tissues helps residents consolidate basic skills prior to performing more advanced techniques in the living tissues. Trainees reported a higher satisfaction rate with the living models. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of living and nonliving training microsurgical models leads to superior results; however, the gold standard remains the living model. The validity of the hypothesis that living models enhance non-technical skills remains to be confirmed.Level of evidence: Not ratable.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic MEDLINE (PubMed) online library search was conducted for preclinical animal studies in vivo , using autologous periodontal ligament, dental pulp, cementum, alveolar periosteal, gingival margin or adipose stem cell types for periodontal tissue complex regeneration purposes. Studies had to be published between 2007.09.01 and 2017.09.01 in the English language. RESULTS: Online library search yielded 2099 results. After the title, abstract and full-text screening ten studies fit inclusion criteria and were pooled into meta-analysis. Overall the stem cell regenerative therapy had a statistically significant positive influence on the periodontal tissue regeneration when compared to the control groups. The biggest influence was made to the regeneration of cementum (standardised mean difference [SMD] 2.25 [95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.31 to 3.2]) while the smallest influence was made to the alveolar bone (SMD 1.47 [95\% CI = 0.7 to 2.25]) the effect size for periodontal ligament regeneration was (SMD 1.8 [95\% CI = 1 to 2.59]). Subgroup analysis showed statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.05) differences between different cell types in the alveolar bone and cementum regeneration groups and in alveolar bone group in relation to scaffold materials. CONCLUSIONS: Stem cell therapy has a positive impact on periodontal tissue complex regeneration. Such therapy has the biggest influence on cementum regeneration meanwhile alveolar bone regeneration is influenced by the least amount. However more and less diverse preclinical studies are needed to have a greater statistical power in future meta-analyses.},

	volume = {8},
	doi = {10.1002/brb3.982},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a globally prevalent neurodegenerative disease, clinically characterized by progressive memory loss and gradual impairment of cognitive functions. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation has been considered a possible therapeutic method for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, no quantitative data synthesis of MSC therapy for AD exists. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to study the effects of MSCs on cognitive deficits in animal models of AD. METHODS: We identified eligible studies published from January 1980 to January 2017 by searching four electronic databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CNKI). The endpoint was the effects of MSCs on cognitive performance evaluated by the Morris water maze (MWM) test including escape latency, and/or number of platform crossing, and/or time in the target quadrant. RESULTS: Nine preclinical studies incorporating 225 animals with AD were included for the meta-analysis. The studies indicated that MSC-based treatment significantly improved the learning function through measurements of the escape latency (SMD = -0.99, 95\% CI = -1.33 to -0.64, p {\textless} .00001). Additionally, we observed that transplantation of MSCs significantly increased the number of platform crossing in six experiments (SMD = 0.78, 95\% CI = 0.43 to 1.13, p {\textless} .0001). What's more, the times in the target quadrant were increased in five studies indicated that transplantation of MSCs could ameliorate the cognitive impairments (SMD = 1.06, 95\% CI = 0.46 to 1.67, p = .0005). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that MSC transplantation could reduce cognitive deficits in AD models. These findings support the further studies to translate MSCs in the treatment of AD in humans.},

A systematic review on this field has been realized by evaluating in the identified studies the in vitro PRP concentration-also analyzing the platelet amount-and the in vivo PRP effects in tissue regeneration compared to any control. The protocol has been developed in agreement with the Preferred Reporting for Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. Multistep research of the PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, PreMEDLINE, Ebase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Clinicaltrials.gov, Scopus database and Cochrane databases has permitted to identify articles on different concentrations of PRP in vitro and related in vivo impact for tissue repair. Of the 965 articles initially identified, 30 articles focusing on PRP concentration have been selected and, consequently, only 15 articles have been analyzed. In total, 40\% (n = 6) of the studies were related to the fixed PRP Concentration Group used a fixed PRP concentration and altered the platelet concentration by adding the different volumes of the PRP (lysate) to the culture. This technique led to a substantial decrease in nutrition available at higher concentrations. Sixty percent (n = 9) of the studies were related to the fixed PRP Volume Group that used a fixed PRP-to-media ratio (Vol/Vol) throughout the experiment and altered the concentration within the PRP volume. For both groups, when the volume of medium (nutrition) decreases, a lower rate of cell proliferation is observed. A PRP concentration of 1.0 × 10(6) plt/μL, appears to be optimal thanks to the constant and plentiful capillary nutrition supply and rapid diffusion of growth factors that happen in vivo and it also respects the blood decree-law. The PRP/media ratio should provide a sufficient nutrition supply to prevent cellular starvation, that is, PRP ≤ 10\% (Vol/Vol) and thus best mimic the conditions in vivo.},

In this systematic review, an overview of the current knowledge on this topic has been provided, based on existing studies and the authors' experience. A multistep search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, PreMEDLINE, Ebase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Clinicaltrials.gov, Scopus database, and Cochrane databases has been performed to identify papers on AD-MSCs, PRP, and biomaterials used in soft tissue defects and chronic wounds. Of the 2136 articles initially identified, 422 articles focusing on regenerative strategies in wound healing were selected and, consequently, only 278 articles apparently related to AD-MSC, PRP, and biomaterials were initially assessed for eligibility. Of these, 85 articles were excluded as pre-clinical, experimental, and in vitro studies. For the above-mentioned reasons, 193 articles were selected; of this amount, 121 letters, expert opinions, commentary, and editorials were removed. The remaining 72 articles, strictly regarding the use of AD-MSCs, PRP, and biomaterials in chronic skin wounds and soft tissue defects, were analyzed. The studies included had to match predetermined criteria according to the patients, intervention, comparator, outcomes, and study design (PICOS) approach. The information analyzed highlights the safety and efficacy of AD-MSCs, PRP, and biomaterials on soft tissue defects and chronic wounds, without major side effects.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI) is a debilitating side effect arising from chemotherapy treatments. The condition is characterised by a range of cognitive deficits including impairment to memory, attention, and concentration. Whilst the underlying mechanisms that contribute to CICI remain unclear, neuroinflammation has been suggested as one key contributor. METHOD: A comprehensive systematic search of EMBASE and Medline via PubMed was conducted to identify studies on neuroimmune reactivity marker expression changes and resulting cognitive changes in preclinical rodent models of CICI. RESULTS: A total of twenty studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the scoping review. There was significant heterogeneity in the methodology employed in the included studies. Our findings demonstrate that widespread changes in cytokines, chemokines, microglia reactivity, and astrocyte reactivity are observed in CICI in the brain regions expected to be affected, given the nature of the cognitive impairment observed in CICI. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was considerable heterogeneity in study design that made comparisons between studies difficult, our findings suggest that neuroinflammation commonly occurs in CICI preclinical rodent models and shows an association with cognitive impairment.},

	abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Venomous snakebite severity ranges from an asymptomatic dry bite to severe envenomation and death. The clinical evaluation aids in prognosis and is essential to determine the risks and potential benefits of antivenom treatment. OBJECTIVES: To identify historical features, clinical examination findings, basic laboratory testing, and clinical grading scales that will risk-stratify patients with pit viper snake envenomation for severe systemic envenomation, severe tissue injury, and/or severe hematologic venom effects. DATA SOURCES: We conducted a structured search of PubMed (1966-October 3, 2017) and Embase database (1980-October 3, 2017) to identify English-language studies that evaluated clinical features predictive of severe envenomation. STUDY SELECTION: We included studies that evaluated the test performance of at least 1 clinical finding with an acceptable reference standard of severe envenomation for venomous snakes of the Western Hemisphere. Only studies involving the most common subfamily, Crotalinae (pit vipers), were evaluated. Seventeen studies with data were available for abstraction. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: The clinical features assessed and severity outcome measures were extracted from each original study. We assessed severity in 3 categories: systemic toxicity, tissue injury, and hematologic effects. Differences were resolved by author consensus. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence of severe systemic envenomation was 14\% (95\% CI, 9\%-21\%). The pooled prevalence of severe tissue injury and severe hematologic venom effects were 14\% (95\% CI, 12\%-16\%) and 18\% (95\% CI, 8\%-27\%), respectively. Factors increasing the likelihood of severe systemic envenomation included the time from bite to care of 6 or more hours (likelihood ratio [LR], 3.4 [95\% CI, 1.1-6.4]), a patient younger than 12 years (LRs, 3.2 [95\% CI, 1.5-7.1] and 2.9 [95\% CI, 1.3-6.2]), large snake size (LR, 3.1 [95\% CI, 1.5-5.7]), and ptosis (LRs, 1.4 [95\% CI, 1.0-2.1] and 3.8 [95\% CI, 1.8-8.3]). Envenomation by the genus Agkistrodon (copperhead and cottonmouth), as opposed to rattlesnakes, decreased the likelihood of severe systemic envenomation (LR, 0.28 [95\% CI, 0.10-0.78]). Initial hypofibrinogenemia (LR, 5.1 [95\% CI, 1.7-15.0]) and thrombocytopenia (LR, 3.7 [95\% CI, 1.9-7.3]) increased the likelihood of severe hematologic venom effects. Other clinical features from history, physical examination, or normal laboratory values were not discriminative. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical features can identify patients at increased risk of severe systemic envenomation and severe hematologic venom effects, but there are few features that are associated with severe tissue injury or can confidently exclude severe envenomation. Physicians should monitor patients closely and be wary of progression from nonsevere to a severe envenomation and have a low threshold to escalate therapy as needed.},

Many AIV strains were studied in challenge experiments in poultry, but no study has combined data from those studies to identify general AIV shedding patterns. These systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to summarize qualitative and quantitative information on virus shedding levels and duration for different AIV strains in experimentally infected poultry species.

A total of 1155 abstract were screened, with 117 studies selected for the qualitative analysis and 71 studies for the meta-analysis. A large heterogeneity in experimental methods was observed and the quantitative analysis showed that experimental variables such as species, virus origin, age, inoculation route and dose, affect virus shedding (mean, peak and duration) for highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV), low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) or both. In conclusion, this study highlights the need to standardize experimental procedures, it provides a comprehensive summary of the shedding patterns of AIV strains by infected poultry and identifies the variables that influence the level and duration of AIV shedding.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Nonautologous graft materials may solve several dilemmas in tympanoplasty by obviating the need for graft harvest, facilitating consistent wound healing, and permitting graft placement in the clinical setting. Prior studies of nonautologous grafts in humans have shown variable outcomes. In this systematic review, we aim to 1) summarize clinical outcomes and 2) discuss limitations in the literature regarding nonautologous grafts for tympanoplasty in humans. METHODS: A literature review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. The study size, etiology and duration of perforation, type of nonautologous graft, and postoperative closure rate were assessed. RESULTS: The PRISMA approach yielded 61 articles, including 3,247 ears that met inclusion criteria. Studies evaluated nonautologous grafts including paper patch, gelatin sponge, growth factors, porcine small-intestinal submucosa, among others. Traumatic perforations (62.3\%) were most commonly studied, whereas postinfectious perforations (31.9\%) and other etiologies (5.8\%) comprised a minority of cases. Acute perforations of {\textless}8 weeks duration constituted just over half of all treated ears. Overall closure rate was 82.1\%, with significantly higher closure rates in acute (89.9\%) versus chronic perforations (64.9\%, P {\textless} .01), regardless of material. A median postoperative air-bone gap of 5.6 dB was found in the 23\% of studies reporting this metric. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of publications reviewing nonautologous materials in tympanoplasty evaluate acute or traumatic perforations, and few rigorously report hearing outcomes. Given available data, porcine submucosa and basic fibroblast growth factor may hold promise for chronic perforation closure. Future studies should report closure rates and hearing outcomes in perforations {\textgreater}8 weeks duration. Laryngoscope, 131:392-400, 2021.},

	abstract = {AIM: Growth factors (GFs) are polypeptides, which are intricately involved in the regulation of bone formation, preservation, and regeneration through gene expression. However, the role of these bioactive agents in osseointegration of dental implants has not been substantially proven. The objective of this systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis was to explore the effect of GFs on early osseointegration of dental implants in animal jaws. An attempt to decipher an adjunctive role of GFs in modulating predictable bone growth in peri-implant areas was done. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic and manual search of different databases was performed. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included and reviewed. The risk of bias (ROB) of the selected studies was assessed using the SR Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (Cochrane) tool. A meta-analysis was also performed to evaluate the different study characteristics quantitatively. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: The total Weighted mean difference was evaluated using the Rev-Manv5.3 algorithm. Chi-square test and I(2) test were done to assess the heterogeneity between the studies. RESULTS: Seven RCTs were included in the study. These were associated with a high ROB. The total weighted mean difference (WMD) of the percentage of bone-implant contact was 3.25\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.49\%-6.03\%; P = 0.001; I(2) = 91\%) between groups with and without exogenous application of GFs. The total WMD of the percentage of newly formed bone area was 4.48\% (95\% CI = 2.31\%-5.90\%; P {\textless} 0.00001, I(2) = 84\%). A high level of heterogeneity (P {\textless} 0.001 for Chi-square test; I (2){\textgreater}50 \%) among comparable studies was observed. CONCLUSION: The ancillary application of external GFs exhibited evidence of early osseointegration, resulting in more predictable and faster results.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Prematurely born infants regularly develop respiratory distress syndrome and require assisted ventilation. Ventilation may injure the premature lung and increase the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a form of noninvasive ventilation, is commonly used in modern neonatology. Limited clinical data are available on the acute and long-term effect of neonatal exposure to CPAP on the lung. Given the restricted clinical data, newborn animal models have been used to study the influence of CPAP on lung structure and function. The findings of animal studies can guide neonatal care and improve the use of CPAP. METHODS: A systematic review of electronic databases (Medline, Embase, and Cinahl) was performed using the medical subject heading terms, "CPAP" or "continuous positive airway pressure" and "animals" and "newborn." Abstracts were screened for inclusion using predetermined eligibility criteria. RESULTS: In total, 235 abstracts were identified and screened for inclusion. Of these, 21 papers were included. Large (N = 18) and small (N = 3) animal models investigated the effects of CPAP. Pulmonary outcomes included gas exchange, lung structure and function, surfactant metabolism, lung inflammation and injury, and the effect of intrapulmonary therapy. Compared to mechanical ventilation, CPAP improves lung function, evokes less lung injury, and does not disrupt alveolar development. Surfactant administration combined with CPAP further improves respiratory outcomes. Of concern are findings that CPAP may increase airway reactivity. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: CPAP offers numerous advantages over mechanical ventilation for the immature lung. The combination of CPAP and exogenous surfactant administration offers further pulmonary benefit.},

The aim of this study is to systematically review the evidence collected in animal studies that correlate mechanical ventilation with neuroinflammation, neuronal damage and cognitive impairment. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases for studies published from inception until August 31st, 2020, that enrolled mechanically ventilated animals and reported on neuroinflammation or neuronal damage markers changes or cognitive-behavioural impairment. RESULTS: Of 5583 studies, 11 met inclusion criteria. Mice, rats, pigs were used. Impact of MV: 4 out of 7 studies reported higher neuroinflammation markers in MV-treated animals and 3 studies reported no differences; 7 out of 8 studies reported a higher neuronal damage and 1 reported no differences; 2 out of 2 studies reported cognitive decline up to 3 days after MV. Higher Tidal volumes are associated with higher changes in brain or serum markers. CONCLUSION: Preclinical evidence suggests that MV induces neuroinflammation, neuronal damage and cognitive impairment and these are worsened if sub-optimal MV settings are applied. Future studies, with appropriate methodology, are necessary to evaluate for serum monitoring strategies. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42019148935.},

This systematic review evaluates the role of Calendula officinalis flower extract as monotherapy compared to control for wound healing in vivo. Searches were conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, CINAHL, and Scopus (up to April 2018) with 14 studies meeting the inclusion criteria, comprising 7 animal experiments and 7 clinical trials. Findings from the review on acute wound healing showed faster resolution of the inflammation phase with increased production of granulation tissue in the test groups treated with extract. These findings were consistent in five animal studies and one randomized clinical trial. Chronic wound healing studies were varied. Two clinical control studies on venous ulcers demonstrated decreased ulcer surface area compared to controls. Another randomized clinical trial demonstrated no improvement for the calendula group in diabetic leg ulcer healing. Burn healing similarly showed mixed results. Two animal studies demonstrated a prophylactic effect for the administration of calendula extract prior to burn injury. A randomized clinical trial of patients suffering from partial to full thickness burns demonstrated no benefit for topical application of calendula extract compared to controls. Two randomized clinical trials assessed the potential for extract to prevent acute post radiation dermatitis, with one study showing improvements compared to trolamine, while the other found no improvement compared to aqua gel cream. Animal studies provide moderate evidence for improved recovery from the inflammation phase and increased production of granulation tissue in calendula extract treatment groups. This review identified some evidence for the beneficial effects of C. officinalis extract for wound healing, consistent with its role in traditional medicine. There is a need for larger, well-designed randomized control trials to assess the effect of calendula on wound healing including complications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:  Bovine and porcine bioprostheses are commonly used for surgical aortic valve replacement. It is unknown if the long-term survival differs between the two valve types.We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare survival in patients who underwent aortic valve replacement and received a bovine or a porcine prosthesis. METHODS:  We performed a systematic search of Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Cohort studies that compared survival between patients who underwent aortic valve replacement and received either a bovine or a porcine bioprosthesis and that reported overall long-term survival with hazard ratio (HR) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) were included. Two authors independently reviewed articles considered for inclusion, extracted the information from each study, and performed the quality assessment. We performed a meta-analysis using a random effects model to calculate the pooled HR (95\% CI) for all-cause mortality. We did sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our findings. RESULTS:  Seven studies published between 2010 and 2015 were included, and the combined study population was 49,190 patients. Of these, 32,235 (66\%) received a bovine, and 16,955 (34\%) received a porcine bioprosthesis. There was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between patients who received a bovine compared with a porcine bioprosthesis (pooled HR 1.00, 95\% CI: 0.92-1.09). Heterogeneity between studies was moderate (55.8\%, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS:  This systematic review and meta-analysis suggest no difference in survival between patients who received a bovine versus a porcine bioprosthesis after aortic valve replacement. Our study provides valuable evidence for the continuing use of both bovine and porcine bioprosthetic valves for surgical aortic valve replacement.},

	abstract = {There are conflicting reports regarding the effect of farrowing house accommodation on piglet performance. The aim of this investigation was to use a systematic review and meta-analyses to summarise the results of publications that focused on direct comparisons between full confinement conventional crates and various designs of loose-housed farrowing pens from loading until weaning. Literature searches in Scopus, BIOSIS Previews, Cab Abstracts, and Web of Science identified 6695 articles. Twenty-two publications were retained for the systematic review and individual meta-analyses after screening for inclusion criteria. The random effects meta-analyses were performed on crate versus pen for number of piglets born alive, number of stillborn piglets, pre-weaning mortality, and number of piglets weaned. Additionally, the modifiers of confinement length (no confinement from loading until weaning or partial confinement for shorter periods of time in the early stages post parturition), enrichment (no enrichment or enrichment provided), and pen size (small, medium, or large) were examined. There was a 14\% increase in the relative risk of piglet mortality in farrowing pens when they were compared with crates (p=0.0015). The number of stillborns per litter was not different between the pen and crate. However, when providing enrichment in the pens, there was an increase in stillborns within farrowing crates versus pens (p=0.009). There was no overall effect on piglets that were born alive or number weaned. As there is no difference between piglets born alive and mortality is significantly higher in farrowing pens, a reduction in the number of piglets weaned was expected but not observed, which was possibly due to the lack of weaning details provided in the publications. This was the first systematic review and meta-analysis conducted on the performance of farrowing accommodation and identified that farrowing pens do compromise post-natal piglet survival. Future efforts should focus on improving sow comfort in the farrowing crate to maximize both piglet and sow welfare.},

	abstract = {Although black (Rattus rattus) and brown (Rattus norvegicus) rats are among the most widespread synanthropic wild rodents, there is a surprising scarcity of knowledge about their ecology in the urban ecosystem. In particular, relatively few studies have investigated their helminth species diversity in such habitat. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guideline to synthesize the existing published literature regarding the helminth fauna of urban rats in developed countries (North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan). We aimed at describing the species diversity and richness of urban rat helminths, the species prevalence and associations, the methods of investigation, the pathological changes observed in the hosts, the risk factors of infection and the public health significance of rat-borne helminthiases. Twenty-three scientific papers published between 1946 and 2019 were reviewed, half of them were conducted in Europe. Twenty-five helminth species and eight genera were described from the liver, digestive tract, lungs and muscles of urban rats. The most commonly reported parasite was Calodium hepaticum. Prevalence and risk factors of helminth infection in urban rats varied greatly between studies. Observed pathological findings in the rat host were generally minor, except for C. hepaticum. Several rat helminths can parasitize humans and are therefore of public health significance. The lack of references to identification keys and the rare use of molecular tools for species confirmation represent the main limitation of these studies. Knowledge gap on this topic and the needs for future research are discussed.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jss.2018.05.025},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The reconstruction of extensive tracheal defects is an unresolved problem. Despite decades of research, a reliable and practical substitute remains to be found. While there have been clinical reports of successful long-segment tracheal reconstruction, reproducibility and widespread applicability of these techniques have yet to be achieved. Large animals such as the dog, pig, sheep, and goat have comparable tracheal morphology and physiology to humans making them useful preclinical models to screen potential therapeutic strategies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The literature was reviewed to identify large animal models commonly used for tracheal reconstruction. A systematic search of PubMed and EMBASE was performed for large animal studies reporting on the reconstruction of long-segment tracheal and carinal defects. Fifty-seven studies were identified for analysis. RESULTS: There is no standard large animal model available for tracheal research. In recent years, livestock species have gained favor over dogs as animal models in this field. The minimum requirements for successful tracheal replacement are rigidity, vascularity, and epithelial lining. Early attempts with synthetic prostheses were met with disappointing results. An autologous tracheal substitute is ideal but hindered by limited donor site availability and the lack of a dominant vascular pedicle for microsurgical reconstruction. Although tracheal allotransplantation enables like-for-like replacement, there are unresolved issues relating to graft vascularity, immunosuppression, and graft preservation. Tissue engineering holds great promise; however, the optimal combination of scaffold, cells, and culture conditions is still indeterminate. CONCLUSIONS: Despite impressive advances in tracheal reconstruction, a durable substitute for extended tracheal defects continues to be elusive.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT: The burden of foodborne illness linked to the consumption of contaminated broiler meat is high in the United States. With the increase in popularity of alternative poultry rearing and production systems, it is important to identify the differences in food safety risks presented by alternative systems compared with conventional methods. Although many studies have been conducted that surveyed foodborne pathogen prevalence along the broiler supply chain, a systematic overview of all of the results is lacking. In the current study, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to quantify the differences in prevalence of Salmonella and Campylobacter spp. in farm environment, rehang, prechill, postchill, and retail samples between conventional and alternative production systems. A systematic search of Web of Science and PubMed databases was conducted to identify eligible studies. Studies were then evaluated by inclusion criteria, and the included studies were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. In total, 137 trials from 72 studies were used in the final meta-analysis. Meta-analysis models were individually constructed for subgroups that were determined by sample type, pathogen, and production type. All subgroups possessed high amounts of heterogeneity (I2 {\textgreater} 75\%). For environmental sample subgroups, Campylobacter prevalence was estimated to be 15.8 and 52.8\% for conventional and alternative samples, respectively. Similar prevalence estimates for both production types were observed for Salmonella environmental samples and all retail samples. For conventional samples, Campylobacter and Salmonella prevalence was highest in prechill samples followed by rehang and postchill samples, respectively. The results herein will be useful in future quantitative microbial risk assessments for characterizing the differences in foodborne illness risks presented by different broiler production systems.},

	abstract = {Several precision livestock farming (PLF) technologies, conceived for optimizing farming processes, are developed to detect the physical and behavioral changes of animals continuously and in real-time. The aim of this review was to explore the capacity of existing PLF technologies to contribute to the assessment of pig welfare. In a web search for commercially available PLF for pigs, 83 technologies were identified. A literature search was conducted, following systematic review guidelines (PRISMA), to identify studies on the validation of sensor technologies for assessing animal-based welfare indicators. Two validation levels were defined: internal (evaluation during system building within the same population that were used for system building) and external (evaluation on a different population than during system building). From 2,463 articles found, 111 were selected, which validated some PLF that could be applied to the assessment of animal-based welfare indicators of pigs (7\% classified as external, and 93\% as internal validation). From our list of commercially available PLF technologies, only 5\% had been externally validated. The more often validated technologies were vision-based solutions (n = 45), followed by load-cells (n = 28; feeders and drinkers, force plates and scales), accelerometers (n = 14) and microphones (n = 14), thermal cameras (n = 10), photoelectric sensors (n = 5), radio-frequency identification (RFID) for tracking (n = 2), infrared thermometers (n = 1), and pyrometer (n = 1). Externally validated technologies were photoelectric sensors (n = 2), thermal cameras (n = 2), microphone (n = 1), load-cells (n = 1), RFID (n = 1), and pyrometer (n = 1). Measured traits included activity and posture-related behavior, feeding and drinking, other behavior, physical condition, and health. In conclusion, existing PLF technologies are potential tools for on-farm animal welfare assessment in pig production. However, validation studies are lacking for an important percentage of market available tools, and in particular research and development need to focus on identifying the feature candidates of the measures (e.g., deviations from diurnal pattern, threshold levels) that are valid signals of either negative or positive animal welfare. An important gap identified are the lack of technologies to assess affective states (both positive and negative states).},

After systematic review, incidence data and study characteristics were extracted from 78 studies conducted in 21 European countries. Pooled prevalence values from 203 extracted observations were estimated from random-effects meta-analysis models adjusted by pathogen, poultry type, sampling stage, cold preservation type, meat cutting type and packaging status. The results suggest that S. aureus is the main pathogen detected in poultry meat (38.5\%; 95\% CI: 25.4⁻53.4), followed by Campylobacter spp. (33.3\%; 95\% CI: 22.3⁻46.4\%), while L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. present lower prevalence (19.3\%; 95\% CI: 14.4⁻25.3\% and 7.10\%; 95\% CI: 4.60⁻10.8\%, respectively). Despite the differences in prevalence, all pathogens were found in chicken and other poultry meats, at both end-processing step and retail level, in packed and unpacked products and in several meat cutting types. Prevalence data on cold preservation products also revealed that chilling and freezing can reduce the proliferation of pathogens but might not be able to inactivate them. The results of this meta-analysis highlight that further risk management strategies are needed to reduce pathogen incidence in poultry meat throughout the entire food chain across Europe, in particular for S. aureus and Campylobacter spp.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Echinococcosis (canine Echinococcus disease) is a neglected tropical disease that causes serious public harm. Dogs, as a terminal host of Echinococcus spp., are a key part of the Echinococcus epidemic. Echinococcosis spreads easily in humans and animals in some areas of China and it is therefore necessary to fully understand the prevalence of Echinococcus spp. in dogs. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Chongqing VIP, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and WanFang databases were searched for relevant articles published in the past 10 years. A final total of 108 studies were included. The overall prevalence of Echinococcus spp. in dogs in China was 7.3\%, with the highest point estimate found in sampling year 2015 (8.2\%) and publication year 2015 (16.5\%). Northwestern China (7.9\%) had the highest infection rate in China. Qinghai Province (13.5\%) showed the highest prevalence among the 11 provinces we included. We also found that geographical and climatic factors are related to the incidence of canine echinococcosis. We further investigated the source of heterogeneity by analysis of subgroups (sampling district, detection method, dog type, season, parasite species, medication, and study quality level). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our research indicated that Echinococcus spp. were still prevalent in some areas in China. More localized prevention and control policies should be formulated, including improving drinking water hygiene and strengthening hygiene promotion. We recommend the rational use of anti-Echinococcus drugs. In addition, treatment of livestock offal and feces and improving the welfare of stray dogs may play an important role in reducing canine Echinococcus infections.},

	abstract = {Background: Brucellosis, a zoonotic disease, infects various hosts, including swine and humans. It has reemerged in recent years as a public health concern, and current studies on brucellosis infection in swine have been conducted worldwide. However, no meta-analyses of global brucellosis infection in swine have been published. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of Brucella species (spp.) in swine worldwide and the factors associated with its persistence. Results: We searched seven databases for published epidemiological studies on brucellosis in pigs, including the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, the VIP Chinese Journal Database and PubMed. We selected 119 articles published from January 1, 2000 to January 3, 2020 for inclusion in the meta-analysis and analyzed the data using a random-effects model. Funnel plots and Egger's test showed significant publication bias in the included studies. The results of the sensitivity analysis showed that our study was relatively stable and reliable. The prevalence of brucellosis in swine was 2.1\% (95\% CI: 1.6-2.6), of which the highest infection rate, which was found in Europe, was 17.4\% (95\% CI: 11.1-24.9). The prevalence in feral pigs (15.0\%, 95\% CI: 8.4-23.2) was higher than that in domestic pigs (1.1\%, 95\% CI 0.2-2.5). The prevalence in high-income countries (15.7\%, 95\% CI 8.0-25.3) was significantly higher than that in middle- (0.8\%, 95\% CI 0.5-1.1), and low-income countries (0.1\%, 95\% CI 0.0-0.2). The prevalence was highest in finishing pigs at 4.9\% (95\% CI 0.9-11.0), and lowest among suckling pigs at 0\% (95\% CI 0.0-0.5). Conclusion: The Brucella prevalence in pig herds currently is distributed widely throughout the world. In some countries, swine brucellosis may be a neglected zoonotic disease. We recommend long-term monitoring of the prevalence of brucellosis in domestic and wild pig herds. Attention should also be paid to animal welfare on intensive pig farms; controlling the breeding density may play an important role in reducing the spread of brucellosis among pigs.},

	abstract = {Background: Bluetongue caused by the bluetongue virus (BTV) is a non-contagious and an insect-borne disease mainly affecting domestic and wild ruminants. Bluetongue in cattle is associated with vesicular lesions, weight loss, low milk production, and low reproductive capacity. It should not be ignored as it is associated with large economic losses to the livestock breeding industry in China. Although many studies have investigated bluetongue virus infection in cattle, no nationwide study on the prevalence of bluetongue virus infection in cattle from China has yet been conducted. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence and risk factors for bluetongue in cattle. Results: We collected 50 publications from 1988 to 2019 through PubMed, ScienceDirect, Chinese Web of Knowledge (CNKI), VIP Chinese journal database, and Wanfang database. A total of the pooled bluetongue seroprevalence of 12.2\% (5,332/87,472) in cattle was tested. The point estimate of bluetongue collected from 2001 to 2011 was 22.5\% (95\% CI: 1.2-58.9), which was higher than after 2012 (9.9\%, 95\% CI: 3.3-19.4). The analysis of the feeding model subgroup revealed that the seroprevalence of bluetongue was significantly higher (P {\textless} 0.05) among free-range cattle (22.5\%; 95\% CI: 7.7-42.3) than among cattle from intensive farming systems (1.8\%; 95\% CI: 0.0-6.7). The seroprevalence of bluetongue in different species showed significant variation (P {\textless} 0.05), with the highest seroprevalence of 39.8\% (95\% CI: 18.7-63.0) in buffalo and the lowest seroprevalence of 4.3\% (95\% CI: 1.2-9.0) in yak. In the zoogeographical division subgroup, the seroprevalence of bluetongue correlated positively within a certain range with the species distribution of Culicoides. Conclusion: Our findings suggested that bluetongue was prevalent in cattle in China. In addition, the contact with sheep, other ruminants, or transmission media such as Culicoides may increase the seroprevalence of bluetongue disease in cattle. It is necessary to carry out continuous monitoring of the bluetongue seroprevalence. Moreover, comprehensive and improved strategies and measures should be implemented to prevent and control the spread of bluetongue.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Swine coccidiosis, a protozoan disease caused by coccidia, can result in diarrhoea and weight loss in piglets and even economic losses in the pig industry. Here, we report the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of coccidia (including Eimeria spp. and Cystoisospora suis) in pigs in China. METHODS: Five databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, Chinese Web of Knowledge, Wanfang, and Chongqing VIP) were searched and 50 studies (46,926 domestic pigs, 22 provinces) ultimately identified pertaining to the prevalence of coccidia infection from 1980 to 2019. We incorporated the effect size using the random-effects model in the "meta" package in R software and conducted univariate and multivariate meta-regression analyses using a mixed-effects model. RESULTS: The pooled prevalence rate of coccidia in pigs was 21.9\%, including the C. suis infection rate of 9.1\%. The highest prevalence of coccidia (39.6\%) was found in northwest China, and this region also presented the lowest prevalence of C. suis (4.7\%). In the subgroup analysis based on sampling year, the highest prevalence of coccidia was detected in 2001 or earlier (32.6\%), whereas the lowest rate was found in 2012 or later (14.3\%). An opposite trend was observed for C. suis (5.5\% in 2000 or earlier vs 14.4\% in 2000 or later). The prevalence of coccidia in extensive farming systems (29.5\%) was higher than that in intensive farming systems (17.3\%). In contrast, the point estimate of C. suis prevalence was lower in the extensive farming systems (5.1\%) than in the intensive farming systems (10.0\%), but the difference was not significant (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Among the four age categories, the highest total coccidia prevalence (26.2\%) was found in finishing pigs, followed by suckling piglets (19.9\%), whereas the highest prevalence of C. suis (14.9\%) was observed in suckling piglets. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that coccidia infection in Chinese pigs is common, although the prevalence of C. suis in pigs does not receive sufficient attention. We recommend the rational use of anticoccidial drugs to avoid drug resistance and the development of preventive and control measures for C. suis to reduce the incidence of swine coccidiosis.},

	abstract = {The risk of developing stress related disorders such as depression is two times higher in women than in men, and social stress is considered the principal etiology for this disorder. Social defeat animal model is the most common procedure to induce social stress in male rodents, but the stressful stimulus and the stress response can be different for each sex. In this regard, social defeat stress model does not fit the social nature of females, and according to the emerging evidence, the social instability stress (SIS) model could be a suitable procedure to investigate this stress related disorder in females. This study aims to systematically review the effects of SIS on physiological and behavioral parameters involved in the pathophysiology of depression, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) method on PubMed, Medline and Web of Science. Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. The reported physiological measures comprised the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, neurotrophic factors, immune and monoaminergic systems, vasopressin and oxytocin receptors, sex hormone levels and estrus cycle, while main behavioral measures involved sucrose preference test, forced swimming test, elevated plus maze, open field test and social interaction. This systematic review revealed a wide variability on the social instability regimen and on the measured variables. However, all studies agree that SIS model can elicit behavioral and physiological alteration involved in stress related disorders, with HPA axis hyperactivity, increased anxiety-like behavior and disrupted reward system being the most repeated outcomes. A unified SIS application criterion is required in order to obtain consistent data and elucidate the underlying mechanisms of anxiety and depression in females.},

	doi = {10.1111/1365-2656.13037},
	abstract = {Sex in crocodilians is not determined by chromosomes, but by egg incubation temperature, where different temperatures produce different clutch sex ratios. Two patterns have been proposed to describe these changes in sex ratios: a 100\% female proportion at low and high temperatures with male predominance at intermediate ones (FMF) or a simpler pattern with a single female-to-male transition (FM). Over the last three decades, researchers have provided empirical information to support either of these two patterns in different species; however, no consensus has been reached partly because data have not been analysed as a whole. Here, we aimed at gathering the existing data on these patterns to provide models of temperature-dependent sex determination in those crocodilians studied so far. Potentially relevant publications were searched on Web of Knowledge, Scopus, Scielo and Science Direct. Studies that reported results on the sexual identity of crocodilian hatchlings obtained from constant temperature incubation treatments were considered. Using statistical models varying in their underlying assumptions, we evaluated which sex-determination pattern was best supported for the studied crocodilians and constructed species-specific and latitude-specific models. Based on the 8,458 sexed hatchlings studied throughout 31 studies, we show that the evidence supports a shared FMF pattern in all the crocodilian species for which enough data are available. We find that such pattern changes between species and at different latitudes. These results suggest a lability of the FMF crocodilian sex-determination pattern, a key feature under the present climate change scenario.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic illnesses like obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular diseases, are worldwide major causes of morbidity and mortality. These pathological conditions involve interactions between environmental, genetic, and epigenetic factors. Recent advances in nutriepigenomics are contributing to clarify the role of some nutritional factors, including dietary fatty acids in gene expression regulation. This systematic review assesses currently available information concerning the role of the different fatty acids on epigenetic mechanisms that affect the development of chronic diseases or induce protective effects on metabolic alterations. METHODS: A targeted search was conducted in the PubMed/Medline databases using the keywords "fatty acids and epigenetic". The data were analyzed according to the PRISMA-P guidelines. RESULTS: Consumption fatty acids like n-3 PUFA: EPA and DHA, and MUFA: oleic and palmitoleic acid was associated with an improvement of metabolic alterations. On the other hand, fatty acids that have been associated with the presence or development of obesity, T2D, pro-inflammatory profile, atherosclerosis and IR were n-6 PUFA, saturated fatty acids (stearic and palmitic), and trans fatty acids (elaidic), have been also linked with epigenetic changes. CONCLUSIONS: Fatty acids can regulate gene expression by modifying epigenetic mechanisms and consequently result in positive or negative impacts on metabolic outcomes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Recently, the field of tissue engineering has made numerous advances towards achieving artificial tendon substitutes with excellent mechanical and histological properties, and has had some promising experimental results. The purpose of this systematic review is to assess the efficacy of tissue engineering in the treatment of tendon injuries. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for the time period 1999 to 2016 for trials investigating tissue engineering used to improve tendon healing in animal models. The studies were screened for inclusion based on randomization, controls, and reported measurable outcomes. The RevMan software package was used for the meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 388 references were retrieved and 35 studies were included in this systematic review. The different biomaterials developed were analyzed and we found that they improve the biomechanical and histological characteristics of the repaired tendon. At meta-analysis, despite a high heterogeneity, it revealed a statistically significant effect in favour of the maximum load, the maximum stress, and the Young's modulus between experimental and control groups. In the forest plot, the diamond was on the right side of the vertical line and did not intersect with the line, favouring experimental groups. CONCLUSIONS: This review of the literature demonstrates the heterogeneity in the tendon tissue engineering literature.

	abstract = {The diagnostic construct of "food addiction" is a highly controversial subject. The current systematic review is the first to evaluate empirical studies examining the construct of "food addiction" in humans and animals. Studies were included if they were quantitative, peer-reviewed, and in the English language. The 52 identified studies (35 articles) were qualitatively assessed to determine the extent to which their findings indicated the following addiction characteristics in relation to food: brain reward dysfunction, preoccupation, risky use, impaired control, tolerance/withdrawal, social impairment, chronicity, and relapse. Each pre-defined criterion was supported by at least one study. Brain reward dysfunction and impaired control were supported by the largest number of studies (n = 21 and n = 12, respectively); whereas risky use was supported by the fewest (n = 1). Overall, findings support food addiction as a unique construct consistent with criteria for other substance use disorder diagnoses. The evidence further suggests that certain foods, particularly processed foods with added sweeteners and fats, demonstrate the greatest addictive potential. Though both behavioral and substance-related factors are implicated in the addictive process, symptoms appear to better fit criteria for substance use disorder than behavioral addiction. Future research should explore social/role impairment, preoccupation, and risky use associated with food addiction and evaluate potential interventions for prevention and treatment.},

This paper systematically reviews the scientific literature regarding whether non-animal origin ingredients of commercial swine feed could introduce or transmit viral pathogens of swine into or within the United States. The purpose of this review is to identify, evaluate, and summarize the relevant scientific knowledge, published through March 2018, and to identify information gaps and research needs, thereby making the available evidence more accessible to policy makers, the swine industry, and the scientific community. A total of 26 documents were selected for the final review process, which included experimental studies, case reports, epidemiological investigations, and scientific opinion, among others. The review found that the scientific literature has addressed some critical experimental questions pertaining to transmission of swine viruses via feed and feed ingredients, but the current body of scientific knowledge lacks conclusive evidence of virus contamination of non-animal origin feed ingredients of commercial swine feed, particularly for imported commodities, and further investigation into the epidemiology of virus transmission via feed to swine under field conditions through natural feeding behavior is warranted. Additional studies of how imported ingredients of commercial swine feed are sourced, processed, transported and, thus, contaminated prior to importation into the United States are needed. Moving forward, studies designed to examine the likely source(s) of contamination and subsequent virus mitigation steps in processing and post-processing may be the most fruitful focus of research.},

Herein, a systematic review and meta-analysis was carried out to estimate pooled prevalence of H. nana infection among human and rodent hosts for the first time in Iran. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase databases (English articles) and SID and Magiran databases (Persian articles) were systematically searched for relevant studies published from inception till May 24, 2020. Chi(2) and I(2) index were used to assess the heterogeneity of the included studies. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's intercept and visual inspection of the funnel plot. Pooled prevalence was estimated using random-effects model with 95 \% confidence interval (CI) and depicted as a forest plot. STATA software was used for analysis. The overall pooled prevalence estimate of H. nana in humans included 1.2 \% (95 \% CI = 1.0-1.4\%). Subgroup analysis revealed 2.2 \% (95 \% CI = 1.8-2.6\%) and 0.5 \% (95 \% CI = 0.3 to 0.8 \%) of H. nana infection among school children and food handlers, respectively. In terms of rodent hosts, the overall pooled prevalence of H. nana infection included 13 \% (95 \% CI = 9.3-16.6\%). Subgroup analysis revealed the highest rate of the infection was in Rattus spp. (19.6 \%; 95 \% CI = 10.6-28.6\%), a genus with synanthropic behavior. It seems, despite the advancement in sanitation infrastructure and hygiene status, the H. nana infection compares to other helminthic diseases remains a challenging public health problem in Iran.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There has been an increased focus on antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) within the animal health domain (World Health Organization, 2015; O'Neill, 2016). Evidence of the effectiveness of interventions designed to enhance AMS is essential to support the development of this practice. This scoping review summarises for the first time the extent, range, and nature of global research activity on approaches for improving AMS in farmers and veterinarians involved in livestock farm animal management, health \& well-being. METHODS: In November 2017 AGRICOLA, CAB Abstracts, EMBASE, MEDLINE, VetsRev and the Web of Science were searched. Studies were selected by two reviewers with 30 \% of excluded and all included studies being independently reviewed by another reviewer. Inclusion criteria were primary studies or literature reviews focusing on antimicrobial use (AMU) in farming or veterinary practices for food-producing animals. Outcomes were changes in, or factors influencing farmers' or veterinarians' AMS. Exclusion criteria were studies on wild or companion animals or reports of the level of, rather influencing factors for AMS, or knowledge/awareness related to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Study characteristics and relevant outcomes were extracted, identified facilitators and barriers grouped into categories, and a narrative synthesis was conducted. The PRISMA checklist extension for scoping reviews was used to guide the reporting of the review. RESULTS: 52 studies were included in the review; seven were intervention studies and 45 were studies of facilitators and barriers of AMU or antimicrobial prescribing (AMP). Studies were predominantly from high-income countries with only seven studies from low- or middle-income countries. Evidence for effective interventions was limited in terms of number of studies and robustness of evidence. There was some effect for an educational intervention in European cattle farmers and the Yellow Card scheme for Danish pig farmers. Significant facilitators to veterinarians' prudent AMP, in the cattle and pig livestock sector, included education, veterinarians' positive attitudes towards AMU reduction, and diagnostic. For farmers, significant facilitators to reduction of AMU were most frequently related to farming management practices. CONCLUSION: This review describes a scarcity of robust study designs and recommendations can be confidently made for better designed studies. Furthermore, greater consideration needs to be given to the outcome measures used in such studies. Nevertheless, the review summarises the evidence on the effectiveness of interventions and significant facilitators to farmers' and veterinarians' AMS, which can provide best currently available evidence to guide improvements in different livestock sectors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several case series and case reports have been published about idiopathic hydrocephalus treatment in dogs and cats using ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPS). OBJECTIVES: To determine the risk and type of complications in dogs and cats after VPS placement. ANIMALS: Sixteen papers were included. Sixty dogs and 13 cats with idiopathic hydrocephalus treated by VPS placement were identified. METHODS: The databases CAB, Scopus, and Medline were used. Idiopathic/congenital hydrocephalus, feline/canine patients, ventriculoperitoneal shunting, complications, and outcomes were inclusion criteria. The focus was on complication type and time frame within which they arose. RESULTS: Complications in dogs (n = 60) were shunt obstruction (6/60; 10\%), pain (4/60; 5.5\%), shunt infection (3/60; 4.1\%), disconnection (3/60; 4.1\%), excessive shunting (2/60; 2.7\%), and kinking (1/60; 1.6\%). Complications in cats (n = 13) were coiling of the shunt in the SC tissue (2/13; 15.4\%); kinking (1/13; 7.7\%); and shunt obstruction (1/13; 7.7\%). Complications were most likely during the first 6 months after shunt placement. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Ventriculoperitoneal shunting is considered a viable treatment option for patients with hydrocephalus. Potential complications should be discussed with the owner. Early diagnosis of complications is essential.},

	doi = {10.1086/701124},
	abstract = {Assortative mating in animals can have substantial evolutionary impact. Numerous reports also make it appear to be pervasive in occurrence. In assortative mating, defined here in behavioral terms, animals select their mates according to a particular shared trait such that mated individuals phenotypically resemble each other more than expected by chance. Body size is a widely studied assortment trait. This is especially relevant for anuran amphibians (frogs and toads), among whom reproductive advantages may accrue to large individuals of both sexes. Anurans also exhibit discrete forms of male mating behavior. Sedentary calling behavior of "sitters" allows for female choice, whereas fighting for possession of mates by "scramblers" precludes female choice. Size-assortative mating in anurans should therefore be a property of sitters, not scramblers. I used meta-analysis to assess the occurrence of true size-assortative mating in relation to mating behavior and other variables in 282 studies of 68 species of anurans. I found publication bias against reporting nonsignificant results and analytical bias resulting from pooling of samples collected at different times or places (Simpson's paradox). Pooled samples significantly inflated the apparent occurrence and strength of size-assortative mating. Controlling for such biases left little credible evidence for size-assortative mating behavior in any anurans. Instead, large-male advantage among scramblers was associated with a secondary pattern of concomitant nonrandom mating. In this disproportionate mating, neither sex behaves according to mate choice rules that could lead to consistently strong assortment. It should thus have relatively little evolutionary impact compared to true assortative mating.},

Although COX-2 is the isoform most studied and has been described in several malignancies associated with histologic criteria of malignancy and worse prognosis, COX-1 has also been linked to some forms of cancer. With the present review our aim was to summarize the current state of knowledge and clarify if and in which type of tumours COX-1 and/or COX-2 expression have real prognostic implications. We searched PubMed database for prognostic studies using predefined inclusion criteria in order to ascertain the prognostic value of COX-1 and COX-2 in malignant neoplasia in dogs and cats. Eighteen studies were analysed. COX-2 was shown to be a negative prognostic factor in canine and feline mammary tumours, canine mast cell tumour, canine melanoma, canine osteosarcoma and canine renal cell carcinoma. COX-1 showed a negative prognostic value in feline oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). We found high heterogeneity among studies regarding COX immunohistochemical evaluation methodology even in the same type of neoplasia pointing out the need for its standardization at least by tumour type. The available data support the use of COX-2 as a prognostic factor in canine (mammary carcinoma, mast cell tumour, melanoma, osteosarcoma and renal carcinoma) and feline (mammary carcinoma) cancers. For COX-1, its use is advised in feline oral SCC.},

The review aims to yield an overview of the contraction modalities influencing the SSC performance in animals and single joint movements in humans. The search was executed in common with the PRISMA statement. CINAHL, MEDLINE (via ProQuest), PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus and Web of Science databases were used for the systematic search from its inception until February 2019. A quality assessment was conducted with a modified Downs and Black checklist. Twenty-five studies were included. SSC effects, leading to increased force/work during a SSC and a reduced force depression (FD) compared to a pure shortening contraction, are existent on different levels of the muscle, from single fiber experiments to the level of in vivo muscle-tendon complex. Muscle performance is dependent on shortening velocity, shortening distance, stretch distance, the time (transition phase) between stretch and shortening and the active prephase duration. Concerning stretch velocity we found conflicting results. The findings from this systematic review indicate that the mechanisms in the early phase of shortening are associated with pre-activation effects, elastic recoil and stretch reflex. Furthermore, we speculate that residual force enhancement (RFE) is mainly responsible for an increased steady-state force compared to a pure shortening contraction.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Pacific Islands have environmental conditions highly favourable for transmission of leptospirosis, a neglected zoonosis with highest incidence in the tropics, and Oceania in particular. Recent reports confirm the emergence and outbreaks of leptospirosis in the Pacific Islands, but the epidemiology and drivers of transmission of human and animal leptospirosis are poorly documented, especially in the more isolated and less developed islands. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a systematic review of human and animal leptospirosis within 25 Pacific Islands (PIs) in Polynesia, Melanesia, Micronesia, as well as Easter Island and Hawaii. We performed a literature search using four international databases for articles published between January 1947 and June 2017. We further included grey literature available on the internet. We identified 148 studies describing leptospirosis epidemiology, but the number of studies varied significantly between PIs. No data were available from four PIs. Human leptospirosis has been reported from 13 PIs, with 63\% of all studies conducted in Hawaii, French Polynesia and New Caledonia. Animal leptospirosis has been investigated in 19 PIs and from 14 host species, mainly pigs (18\% of studies), cattle (16\%) and dogs (11\%). Only 13 studies provided information on both human and animal leptospirosis from the same location. Serology results were highly diverse in the region, both in humans and animals. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study suggests that, as in other tropical regions, leptospirosis is widespread in the PIs while showing some epidemiological heterogeneity. Data are scarce or absent from many PIs. Rodents, cattle, pigs and dogs are all likely to be important carriers, but the relative importance of each animal species in human infection needs to be clarified. Epidemiological surveys with appropriate sampling design, pathogen typing and data analysis are needed to improve our understanding of transmission patterns and to develop effective intervention strategies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) in young adults is a challenging disorder that can impairs the quality of life of a patient. The disease also leads to frequent occurrences of collapse of the femoral head and resultant dysfunction of the hip joint. In recent years, some scholars have studied steroid-induced lipid metabolism disorder and achieved the effect of steroid-induced ONFH treatment. This study aims to review the investigations on the hepatic CYP3A (cytochrome P4503A enzyme) genetic polymorphisms in steroid-induced ONFH patients. We then further explore its activity correlation with the development of steroid-induced ONFH in a rabbit model. METHODS: A systematic literature search of articles was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Springerlink, and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure database up to February 2017. Twelve relevant articles were retrieved. The odds ratios, standard mean difference, and 95\% confidence intervals were calculated to assess the effect of hepatic CYP3A activity on the rabbit model with steroid-induced ONFH. Fixed-effects and random-effects models were used to analyze the heterogeneity. Begg's funnel plot was used to assess publication bias. RESULTS: High hepatic CYP3A activity significantly decreased the risk for steroid-induced ONFH in the rabbit model (p {\textless}. 05). The CYP3A gene may be potentially associated with increased risk of steroid-induced ONFH in the human allele model. CONCLUSION: The study suggests that high hepatic CYP3A activity decreases the risk of steroid-induced ONFH.},

However, there have been no meta-analysis to investigate the effects of exercise on NP induced by peripheral nerve injury in rat models. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched from inception to January 2019. A random-effect model was implemented to provide effect estimates for pain-related behavioral test outcome. Mean differences (MDs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Results: Fourteen studies were included. For the mechanical withdrawal threshold, rats in the exercised group exhibited significantly higher thresholds than those in the control group, with a MD of 0.91 (95\% CI 0.11-1.71), 3.11 (95\% CI 1.56-4.66), 3.48 (95\% CI 2.70-4.26), 4.16 (95\% CI 2.53-5.79), and 5.58 (95\% CI 3.44-7.73) at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks, respectively. Additionally, thermal withdrawal latency increased in the exercised group compared with the control group, with a MD of 2.48 (95\% CI 0.59-4.38), 3.57 (95\% CI 2.10-5.05), 3.92 (95\% CI 2.82-5.03), and 2.84 (95\% CI 1.29-4.39) at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks, respectively. Subgroup analyses were performed for pain models, exercise start point, exercise forms, and duration, which decreased heterogeneity to some extent. Conclusion: This meta-analysis indicated that exercise provoked an increase in mechanical withdrawal threshold and thermal withdrawal latency in animal NP models. Exercise therapy may be a promising non-pharmacologic therapy to prevent the development of NP. Further, preclinical studies focused on improving experiment design and reporting are still needed.},

Studies of natural ACL healing without intervention, in vitro studies, ex vivo studies, and studies without controls were excluded. Evidence level, methodologic quality, and risk of bias of each included study were identified using previously established tools. RESULTS: Thirteen animal studies were included. Six of 7 studies using bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem (stromal) cells (BMSCs) reported a positive enhancement in histology, biomechanics, and biochemistry within 12 weeks postoperatively. Four studies using ACL-derived vascular stem cells showed a promoting effect in histology, biomechanics, and imaging within 8 weeks postoperatively. Two studies focusing on animal tendon-derived stem cells (TDSCs) and human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUCB-MSCs) reported promotable effects for the early healing in a small animal ACL model. CONCLUSIONS: BMSCs, ACL-derived vascular stem cells, TDSCs, and hUCB-MSCs were shown to enhance the healing of ACL injury during the early phase in small animal models.

	abstract = {For pig somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), artificial activation to trigger development can improve efficiency. However, because timing is key to activation, delayed activation is controversial. Two oocyte activation procedures are available: those that occur immediately after fusion and those that take place several hours after fusion. Both methods are successful for generating SCNT fetuses. We studied whether delayed activation is associated with pig SCNT embryo development. We searched the literature for publications from 2000 to 2018 and identified 1109 studies, 8 of which we included in a meta-analysis. A Higgins statistic was used to measure heterogeneity. Delayed activation enhanced embryo cleavage (OR=0.73, 95\% CI 0.61-0.87) and blastocyst formation (OR=0.79, 95\% CI 0.65-0.97) significantly and offered the same quality pig SCNT embryo (OR=-0.03, 95\% CI -3.12-3.05). The Egger method and Begg's test were used to estimate publication bias, and there was none (Pr {\textgreater} , z, =1). The most commonly used pig embryo media are NCSU-23 and PZM. Studies suggest that each offers unique advantages. Culture medium influences cleavage heterogeneity, and NCSU-23 can increase cleavage. Delayed time causes blastocyst heterogeneity; if the delay exceeds 1 h of activation, blastocyst formation improves. If the delay does not exceed 30 min, blastocyst formation decreases. Donor nuclei and recipient oocyte cytoplasm require a period of adaptation for chromatin remodeling and reprogramming. The timing of these events depends on maternal factors in the recipient oocyte cytoplasm. Thus, recipient oocyte cytoplasm requires time to mix with donor cytoplasm. Then, maternal factors can be added after donor nuclei are added. New nuclei may shuttle mRNA to the cytoplasm, and this can cause chromatin remodeling and reprogramming. Thus, future SCNT studies should focus on delay of activation timing.},

	abstract = {Salmonellosis is a leading cause of foodborne illnesses in humans with cattle being one of the reservoirs for Salmonella. We estimated a pooled prevalence of Salmonella in apparently healthy cattle and examined serotype diversity through systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published between 2000 and 2017. Peer reviewed publications reporting the prevalence of Salmonella in cattle were searched through five electronic databases (PubMed, Google scholar, Agricola, Scopus, CAB direct) and through manual search. We obtained 71 publications with 75 datasets consisting a total of 52,766 animals examined and 5,010 Salmonella positive cattle from 29 countries in six continents (except from Antarctica). Pooled prevalence of Salmonella in cattle was 9\% (95\% confidence interval: 7-11\%). Significantly high heterogeneity (I (2) = 98.7\%, P {\textless} 0.01) was observed among all studies as well as within continents. Prevalence varied from 2\% (Europe) to 16\% (North America). Overall, 143 different serotypes were reported with the most diverse serotypes being reported from Africa (76 different serotypes) followed by North America (49 serotypes). The 10 most frequently reported serotypes (Montevideo, Typhimurium, Kentucky, Meleagridis, Anatum, Cerro, Mbandaka, Muenster, Newport, and Senftenberg) accounted for 65\% of the isolates for which specific serotype information was reported. Salmonella Montevideo and S. Dublin are the most frequently reported serotypes in North America and Europe, respectively, while S. Typhimurium was the most frequent in Africa, Asia and Australasia. Our results indicated variability both in the prevalence and serotype diversity of Salmonella in cattle across continents. Although all Salmonella serotypes are potentially pathogenic to humans, five (Montevideo, Typhimurium, Anatum, Mbandaka, and Newport) of the top 10 serotypes identified in this study are among the serotypes most commonly associated with clinical illnesses in humans.},

	abstract = {Acrobatic exercise is considered a complex motor activity and may promote motor learning and neuroplasticity. The objective of this systematic review was to verify possible plastic brain changes induced by acrobatic exercise in non-lesioned rat and mouse through the analysis of experimental studies. Manual and electronic searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE and ISI Web of Science databases, without restriction to language or publication date. Synaptogenesis and neurogenesis were selected as the primary outcomes. To evaluate the risk of bias of individual studies, we used the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) RoB tool. We found 1780 studies, from which 18 fulfilled the inclusion criteria in this review. Seventeen studies evaluated the cerebellum, six the motor cortex, five the striatum and two evaluated the hippocampus. The results showed that acrobatic exercise promotes plastic changes in brain areas of rats, and such changes are dependent of training frequency and duration. However, studies were heterogeneous regarding the proteins analyzed and the training protocols, which made it difficult to compare and determine ideal acrobatic exercise parameters for neuroplasticity. Concerning the methodological quality of studies, most of them presented high risk of bias with absence of relevant study design information. New research with detailing training protocols and analysis might contribute to clarify the role of acrobatic exercise in neuroplasticity and how it could be used in translational research.},

	abstract = {Dengue is a rapidly spreading mosquito-borne flavivirus infection that is prevalent in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Humans are known to be the main reservoir host maintaining the epidemic cycles of dengue but it is unclear if dengue virus is also maintained in a similar enzootic cycle. The systematic review was conducted in accordance to Cochrane's PRISMA recommendations. A search was done on PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and Cochrane Library. Key data on animal dengue positivity was extracted and classified according to animal type and diagnostic modes. Of the 3818 articles identified, 56 articles were used in this review. A total of 16,333 animals were tested, 1817 of which were positive for dengue virus by RT-PCR or serology. Dengue positivity was detected in bats (10.1\%), non-human primates (27.3\%), birds (11\%), bovid (4.1\%), dogs (1.6\%), horses (5.1\%), pigs (34.1\%), rodents (3.5\%), marsupials (13\%) and other small animals (7.3\%). While majority of dengue positivity via serology suggests potential enzootic transmission, but regular dengue virus spillback cannot be excluded. With the exception of bats, acute infection among animals is limited. Further investigation on animals is critically required to better understand their role as potential reservoir in dengue transmission.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preventive chemotherapy is a useful tool for the control of Taenia solium taeniasis and cysticercosis. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the scientific evidence concerning the effectiveness and safety of different drugs in preventive chemotherapy for T. solium taeniasis in endemic populations. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of controlled and uncontrolled studies, assessing the efficacy and adverse effects (among other outcomes) of albendazole, niclosamide and/or praziquantel for preventive chemotherapy of T. solium taeniasis. A comprehensive search was conducted for published and unpublished studies. Two reviewers screened articles, completed the data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. A meta-analysis of cure rate and relative reduction in prevalence was performed. The protocol for this review was registered on the International prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO), number CRD42018112533. RESULTS: We identified 3555 records, of which we included 20 primary studies reported across 33 articles. Meta-analyses of drug and dose showed that a single dose of praziquantel 10mg/kg, albendazole 400mg per day for three consecutive days, or niclosamide 2g, resulted in better cure rates for T. solium taeniasis (99.5\%, 96.4\% and 84.3\%, respectively) than praziquantel 5mg/kg or single dose albendazole 400mg (89.0\% and 52.0\%, respectively). These findings have a low certainty of evidence due to high risk of bias in individual studies and heterogeneity in combined estimates. In relation to side-effects, most studies reported either no or only mild and transient side-effects within the first three days following drug administration for all drugs and doses. CONCLUSION: Evidence indicated that praziquantel 10mg/kg, niclosamide 2g, and triple dose albendazole 400mg were effective as taenicides and could be considered for use in mass drug administration programs for the control of T. solium taeniasis. Evidence was not found that any of these drugs caused severe side effects at the indicated doses, although the extent of the available evidence was limited.},

	abstract = {The objective of the study was to update a prior meta-analysis on the efficacy of the treatment of bovine endometritis with PGF(2α). Clinical endometritis in cattle is defined as the presence of a purulent or mucopurulent vaginal discharge after 20 or 26 d, respectively, postpartum. Although the prevalence and impact of this disease are well known, the questions of whether and how to treat endometritis are still controversially discussed. Hence, to ensure timeliness of scientific results, we updated an existing meta-analysis published in 2013 that showed no treatment effect of PGF(2α) in cases of bovine endometritis. As in the prior meta-analysis, a comprehensive literature search was conducted. After applying specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, 3 trials remained that could be added to the 6 trials in the initial meta-analysis. Data for each trial were analyzed using the meta-analysis software Review Manager (version 5.3; The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark). Estimated effect sizes of PGF(2α) were calculated on calving to first service interval (CFSI) and calving to conception interval (CCI). As revealed by the initial meta-analysis, PGF(2α) treatment still had no effect on both reproductive parameters. Heterogeneity remained substantial for CFSI and CCI and even increased for CCI compared with the initial meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis, however, did not reveal a source of heterogeneity. In updating the meta-analysis, publication bias for trials reporting CCI became even more pronounced, suggesting that studies with higher standard error (i.e., usually smaller studies) that reported a prolonging effect on CCI after a PGF(2α) treatment were less likely to be published. Finally, although the number of trials published on the chosen topic and their comparability are still limited, this update of our meta-analysis now provides results that are based on approximately twice the number of included cows. The overall outcome, however, has not substantially changed and a positive effect of a PGF(2α) treatment in case of clinical endometritis could not be shown. Therefore, we do not recommend a treatment of bovine endometritis with PGF(2α) as a means to improve reproductive performance.},

	abstract = {Linguatula serrata is known as a cosmopolitan zoonotic parasite whose adult form inhabits the upper respiratory system, nasal airways and frontal sinuses of dogs, foxes, cats and other carnivores, which are recognized as its final hosts. Its immature form resides in mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, lungs and spleen of herbivorous and other ruminants, which serve as its intermediate hosts. Both adult and nymphal stages of L. serrata can infect humans, which typically occurs via ingestion of eggs of infected dogs or consumption of raw or undercooked infected viscera of contaminated herbivores. The most common form of infection in human is nasopharyngeal linguatulosis, also known as Halzoun syndrome or Marrara syndrome. This paper presents a review of previous studies on L. serrata conducted in Iran from 1969 to 2018 and other countries. It was found that despite the fact that many studies have been conducted in Iran, the rate of infection with this parasite has not been studied in some areas of the country. In addition, the rate of infection with L. serrata increased with the age of ruminant animals and it was significantly higher in some areas. The prevalence of L. serrata nymphal infections in most areas was higher in goats in comparison to the other animals which can be an important risk factor for human infection. Although there was no significant difference in the rate of infection among male and female animals, the prevalence of L. serrata in male animals was typically lower than females. There was no significant difference in the seasonality of nymph infection.},

In this manuscript, we reviewed systematically the available literature on molecular epidemiology of ASF in Tanzania and its eight neighboring countries in order to establish the transmission dynamics of ASFV between these countries. Data were retrieved from World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS), Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and CrossRef databases, using the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and reviewed to document ASF outbreaks and ASFV genotypes distribution. Using phylogeographic approach applied to ASFV p72 sequence dataset, the evolutionary history and the dispersal pattern of the ASFV strains were assessed. From 2005 to 2019, a total of 1588 ASF outbreaks affecting 341,742 cases that led to 302,739 domestic pig deaths were reported. The case fatality rates (CFR) varied from 15.41\% to 98.95\% with an overall CFR of 88.58\%. Fifteen different p72 ASFV genotypes were reported and the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for ASFV strains dated back to 1652.233 (1626.473, 1667.735) with an evolutionary rate of 4.805 × 10(-5) (2.5857 × 10(-5), 9.7789 × 10(-5)). Phylogeographic dispersal analysis revealed several transboundary spread events of ASFV strains between these countries. These results suggest persistent circulation of ASFV in these countries and advocate for more research to improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of the virus and for a regional approach to mitigate the spread of ASFV.},

	abstract = {Due to the ongoing expansion of Ixodes scapularis (blacklegged tick) throughout the northeastern and midwestern United States, there is need to identify the role wildlife hosts play in the establishment and maintenance of tick populations. To quantify and synthesize the patterns of I. scapularis and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and sensu lato prevalence relative to wildlife hosts, we reviewed the findings of independent studies conducted throughout the United States. We performed a comprehensive literature search from 1970 to 2017 using the ISS Web of Science Core Collection and the keywords "Ixodes scapularis," "Ixodes dammini" and "Borrelia burgdorferi." We identified 116 studies for inclusion in our meta-analysis, with 187,414 individual wildlife hosts captured and examined for I. scapularis and either the host or ticks collected subsequently tested for B. burgdorferi. We found that only 13\% of the wildlife mammals sampled comprised species other than Odocoileus virginianus (white-tailed deer) and Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed mouse). To examine whether there were regional differences between the Northeast, Midwest and the Southeast U.S. in I. scapularis infestation rates on wildlife hosts, we used general linear models (glm), with post hoc pairwise comparisons. In most cases, detection of I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi was significantly higher in the Northeast than the Midwest. Using data on host-specific I. scapularis infestation prevalence, B. burgdorferi prevalence in feeding larvae, and host permissiveness, we developed an epizootiological model to determine the relative contributions of individual hosts to B. burgdorferi-infected nymphs. Our model provides additional evidence that wildlife hosts other than P. leucopus may contribute more to Lyme disease risk than commonly thought. To aid in understanding the ecology of Lyme disease, we propose that additional studies sample non-Peromyscus spp. hosts to obtain more detailed tick and pathogen infestation and infection estimates, respectively, for these less frequently sampled wildlife hosts.},

Contamination from the environment can contaminate foods with Listeria spp. Consumption of foods containing L. monocytogenes can lead to listeriosis in susceptible people (adults with a compromised immune system), pregnant women, and infants. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of Listeria spp. and L. monocytogenes in various foods in Iran. We searched PubMed, Science direct, Scopus, Google scholar, and Iranian local databases including Iranian scientific information database and Magiran for relevant studies up to May 2015 using related keywords. In our preliminary search, we retrieved 1344 articles. After removing duplicates and reviewing titles/abstracts, 117 articles were considered, out of which, 75 articles had sufficient quality for inclusion in this meta-analysis. The prevalence of Listeria spp. contamination was about 18.3\% in poultry, 8.5\% in raw meat, 14.6\% in ready-to-eat (RTE) foods, 10\% in sea foods, 7.3\% in traditional dairy, 3.2\% in commercial dairy, and 0.1\% in eggs. The findings showed that L. monocytogenes was most prevalent in ready to eat (9.2\%), seafood (5.1\%), poultry (5\%), traditional dairy (4\%), raw meat (2.6\%), commercial dairy (1.4\%), and egg (0.2\%), respectively. Furthermore, the presence of L. monocytogenes particularly in RTE foods (that are consumed without further heat processing) and under-cooked products could be a potential risk for public health. So, contamination should be controlled at all levels of the food chain.},

The variables extracted from the articles were classified according to the type of feeding system and tocopherol level in the diet of lambs. Production systems alter the qualitative characteristics of meat. Lambs raised exclusively on pasture present a higher tocopherol concentration in their meat, a lower omega 6:omega 3 ratio, a lower omega 6 concentration, and a higher conjugated linoleic acid concentration. Regardless of the dietary systems, when we classify the tocopherol levels of lamb diet, the tocopherol concentration and fatty acid level are altered by tocopherol levels in the diet. The lower tocopherol level in the diet results in meat with lower tocopherol concentration and with greater propensity to lipid oxidation.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12967-020-02649-6},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In pre-clinical research, systematic reviews have the potential to mitigate translational challenges by facilitating understanding of how pre-clinical studies can inform future clinical research. Yet their conduct is encumbered by heterogeneity in the outcomes measured and reported, and those outcomes may not always relate to the most clinically important outcomes. We aimed to systematically review outcomes measured and reported in pre-clinical in vivo studies of pharmacological interventions to treat high blood glucose in mouse models of type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A systematic review of pre-clinical in vivo studies of pharmacological interventions aimed at addressing elevated blood glucose in mouse models of type 2 diabetes was completed. Studies were screened for eligibility and outcomes extracted from the included studies. The outcomes were recorded verbatim and classified into outcome domains using an existing outcome taxonomy. Outcomes were also compared to those identified in a systematic review of registered phase 3/4 clinical trials for glucose lowering interventions in people with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Review of 280 included studies identified 532 unique outcomes across 19 domains. No single outcome, or domain, was measured in all studies and only 132 (21\%) had also been measured in registered phase 3/4 clinical trials. A core outcome set, representing the minimum that should be measured and reported, developed for type 2 diabetes effectiveness clinical trials includes 18 core outcomes, of these 12 (71\%) outcomes were measured and reported in one or more of the included pre-clinical studies. CONCLUSIONS: There is heterogeneity of outcomes reported in pre-clinical research. Harmonisation of outcomes across the research pathway using a core outcome set may facilitate interpretation, evidence synthesis and translational success, and may contribute to the refinement of the use of animals in research. Systematic review registration: The study was prospectively registered on the PROSPERO Database, registration number CRD42018106831.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to interrogate the evidence base for treatment of keratomalacia in dogs and cats, through examination of the applicable literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies were screened for evidence to answer the following question Which of the treatment options for keratomalacia in dogs and cats offers the best chance of globe survival, the fastest time to resolution with globe survival, and the best visual outcome. The search utilised the PubMed (http://www.pubmed.gov/) and ISI Web of Science (http://wok.mimas.ac.uk/) databases. Databases were searched using the following terms: (keratomalacia OR corneal melt OR corneal malacia) AND (dog OR canine OR canid OR cat OR feline OR felid) AND (treatment OR outcome OR morbidity OR complications). Studies were assessed by one author (CH) and excluded if they related to less than three keratomalacia cases, experimental treatments, in vitro studies, or did not provide information regarding outcome. Studies were classified to a level of evidence according to the system described by the Oxford Centre for EvidenceBased Medicine. RESULTS: Eighteen (18) studies were identified as providing information to answer the proposed question, one as level 3, 10 as level 4 and seven as level 5 evidence. Only one study compared two treatments, the remaining were prospective or retrospective case series of a single treatment intervention. Study design was highly variable with respect to population size, followup and outcome assessment, making direct comparison difficult, and metaanalysis was not applied. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, the evidence for improved outcome of one proposed treatment over another proposed treatment for keratomalacia in dogs and/or cats is very weak.},

On September 21, 2017, we identified relevant studies using 12 databases. The estimates of the included studies were pooled as a risk ratio (RR). We conducted a network and pairwise random-effects meta-analysis for both direct and indirect comparisons of different organisms that are known to cause diarrhea. The primary and secondary analysis outcomes were clinical response until cessation of illness, parasitological response and adverse events. We included 18 studies in our analysis. In cryptosporidiosis, the overall estimate favored nitazoxanide in its clinical response in comparison with placebo RR 1.46 [95\% CI 1.22-1.74; P-value {\textless}0.0001]. Network meta-analysis among patients with Giardia intestinalis showed an increase in the probability of diarrheal cessation and parasitological responses in comparison with placebo, RR 1.69 [95\% CI 1.08-2.64, P-score 0.27] and RR 2.91 [95\% CI 1.72-4.91, P-score 0.55] respectively. In Clostridium difficile infection, the network meta-analysis revealed a non-significantly superior clinical response effect of nitazoxanide to metronidazole 31 days after treatment RR 1.21 [95\% CI 0.87-1.69, P-score 0.26]. In Entamoeba histolytica, the overall estimate significantly favored nitazoxanide in parasitological response with placebo RR 1.80 [95\% CI 1.35-2.40, P-value {\textless} 0.001]. We highlighted the effectiveness of nitazoxanide in the cessation of diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium, Giardia intestinalis and Entamoeba histolytica infection. We also found significant superiority of NTZ to metronidazole in improving the clinical response to G. intestinalis, thus it may be a suitable candidate for treating infection-induced diarrhea. To prove the superiority of NTZ during a C. difficile infection may warrant a larger-scale clinical trial since its superiority was deemed insignificant. We recommend nitazoxanide as an appropriate option for treating infectious diarrhea.},

The present work provides a comprehensive review of the available literature concerning the anti-inflammatory properties of crocin in various organs/systems as well as its anti-nociceptive effects. PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases were systematically searched up to 28 March 2020 to detect all relevant preclinical and human studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. In total, 104 studies were included for qualitative synthesis. This systematic search and review indicated that crocin not only combats reactive oxygen species production and suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion but also alleviates inflammation in various organs (e.g. the lung, heart, brain, and kidney), in a series of animal models and in vitro experiments, via regulating mainly NF-B pathway and NF-Bp65 translocation to the cell nucleus. In this context, modulation of PI3K/Akt appears to be a favorable crocin target contributing to NF-B pathway inhibition. Even though data is limited in humans with only one clinically relevant study retrieved, the results of preclinical studies regarding anti-inflammatory/anti-nociceptive effects of crocin are promising and warrant further testing in clinical settings.},

Despite the present evidence showing spontaneous remyelination after TSCI the cellular origin of new myelin and the time course of the axon ensheathment/remyelination remained controversial issue. In this systematic review the trend of oligodendrocyte death after injury as well as the extent and the cellular origin of oligodendrogliogenesis were comprehensively evaluated. The study design was based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)-guided systematic review. PubMed and EMBASE were searched with no temporal or linguistic restrictions. Also, hand-search was performed in the bibliographies of relevant articles. Non-interventional animal studies discussing different types of myelinating cells including oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) were evaluated. The extent of oligodendrocyte death, oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination were the pathophysiological outcome measures. We found 12,359 studies, 34 of which met the inclusion criteria. The cumulative evidence shows extensive oligodendrocytes cell death during the first week post-injury (pi). OPCs and peripheral invading Schwann cells are the dominant cells contributing in myelin formation. The maximum OPC proliferation was observed at around 2 weeks pi and oligodendrogliogenesis continues at later stages until the number of oligodendrocytes return to normal tissue by one month pi. Taken together, the evidence in animals reveals the potential role for endogenous myelinating cells in the axon ensheathment/remyelination after TSCI and this can be the target of pharmacotherapy to induce oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin formation post-injury.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To reach an evidence-based knowledge in the context of the temporal-spatial pattern of neuronal death and find appropriate time of intervention in order to preserve spared neurons and promote regeneration after traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study design was based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)-guided systematic review. PubMed and EMBASE were searched (24 October, 2015) with no temporal or linguistic restrictions. Hand-search was performed in the bibliographies of relevant articles. Non-interventional animal studies evaluating time-dependent neuronal death following acute mechanical trauma to the spinal cord were included. We separately evaluated the fate of various populations of neurons including propriospinal neurons, ventral motor neurons, Clarke's column neurons, and supraspinal neurons. RESULTS: We found 11,557 non-duplicated studies. Screening through the titles and abstracts led to 549 articles, 49 of which met the inclusion criteria. Both necrotic and apoptotic neuronal deaths occur after TSCI, though necrosis is the prominent mechanism. There are differences in the responses of intrinsic neurons of the spinal cord to the TSCI. Also, the extent of neuronal death in the supraspinal neurons depends on the anatomical location of their axons. CONCLUSION: In order to develop new therapies, selection of the injury model and time of intervention has a crucial role in the efficacy of therapy. In addition, examining the safety and efficacy of an intervention by reliable methods not confounded by the injury-related changes would promote translation of therapies to the clinical application.},

	abstract = {This study systematically reviews the peer-reviewed literature on livestock production and food security in urbanizing environments of developing countries to synthesize the existing evidence and identify priorities for future research. Specifically, a systematic literature review was undertaken using PubMed, ISI Web of Science and Scopus databases over the period 1980-2017, resulting in a final number of 72 articles meeting our selection criteria. The results revealed a fragmentation in the literature, which draws from a very small number of studies, and is positioned in widely varied research areas, environments, livestock systems and consumption patterns. With such heterogeneity, drawing generalizations from the literature may be unreachable. Furthermore, the literature is largely qualitative in nature, with very few comprehensive models to capture and integrate empirical evidence. Food security was typically found to be narrowly defined, focusing primarily on interlinks with livestock supply. Considerably less attention has been given to other relevant dimensions of food security, such as accessibility, utilization and stability. Another important finding of relevance to food security is a need to address the "missing middle" in livestock value chains since the literature has customarily concentrated extensively on the two ends of the livestock value chain, i.e., on production and consumption, while widely ignoring other elements and actors along the value chain. A further focus on the interrelationships between livestock production, food security and urbanization in developing countries through a holistic and interdisciplinary approach is recommended. Particularly, future research aiming to understand livestock systems in the context of rapid urbanization should put more emphasis on addressing the full continuum of the livestock value chain and the four dimensions that drive food security in developing countries and how they possibly interrelate.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cryptosporidium spp. are causative agents of gastrointestinal diseases in a wide variety of vertebrate hosts. Mortality resulting from the disease is low in livestock, although severe cryptosporidiosis has been associated with fatality in young animals. METHODS: The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to review the prevalence and molecular data on Cryptosporidium infections in selected terrestrial domestic and wild ungulates of the families Bovidae (bison, buffalo, cattle, goat, impala, mouflon sheep, sheep, yak), Cervidae (red deer, roe deer, white-tailed deer), Camelidae (alpaca, camel), Suidae (boar, pig), Giraffidae (giraffes) and Equidae (horses). Data collection was carried out using PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct and Cochran databases, with 429 papers being included in this systematic analysis. RESULTS: The results show that overall 18.9\% of ungulates from the investigated species were infected with Cryptosporidium spp. Considering livestock species (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, horses and buffaloes), analysis revealed higher Cryptosporidium infection prevalence in ungulates of the Cetartiodactyla than in those of the Perissodactyla, with cattle (29\%) being the most commonly infected farm animal. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the investigated domestic ungulates are considered potential sources of Cryptosporidium contamination in the environment. Control measures should be developed to reduce the occurrence of Cryptosporidium infection in these animals. Furthermore, literature on wild populations of the named ungulate species revealed a widespread presence and potential reservoir function of wildlife.},

The role of wild bird movements in this global spread has been extensively studied while the role of animal, human and fomite movement within commercial poultry production and trade networks remains poorly understood. The aim of this work is to better understand these roles in relation to the different routes of AI spread. A scoping literature review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) using a search algorithm combining twelve domains linked to AI spread and animal/human movements within poultry production and trade networks. Only 28 out of 3,978 articles retrieved dealt especially with the role of animal, human and fomite movements in AI spread within the international trade network (4 articles), the national trade network (8 articles) and the production network (16 articles). While the role of animal movements in AI spread within national trade networks has been largely identified, human and fomite movements have been considered more at risk for AI spread within national production networks. However, the role of these movements has never been demonstrated with field data, and production networks have only been partially studied and never at international level. The complexity of poultry production networks and the limited access to production and trade data are important barriers to this knowledge. There is a need to study the role of animal and human movements within poultry production and trade networks in the global spread of AI in partnership with both public and private actors to fill this gap.},

The aim of the current paper is to systematically review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the effectiveness of AAT for schizophrenia and related disorders. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, CAB Abstracts, and Web of Science for RCTs of AAT for schizophrenia and related disorders. Primary outcomes were mental state and behaviour, clinical global response, and quality of life and wellbeing. Studies were eligible if they were RCTs that had compared AAT, or other animal-assisted intervention, to any control group using any participants with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia (or related disorder), regardless of age, gender, setting, or severity and duration of illness. Seven studies were identified for the review. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity of studies, including marked differences in outcome measures and interventions. Five out of seven studies included symptoms as an outcome measure, with one reporting improvements in negative symptoms and one study reporting improvements in positive and emotional symptoms. The remaining studies reported no significant effects of AAT. Three studies included quality of life as an outcome measure but did not find any significant effects. Two studies did, however, report improvements in various measures of self-view. The use of AAT for schizophrenia remains inconclusive and there is currently not enough evidence to draw any firm conclusions due to heterogeneity of studies, risk of bias, and small samples. Rigorous, large-scale RCTs are needed to assess the true impact of AAT on schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mitochondria are essential organelles that provide energy for cellular functions, participate in cellular signaling and growth, and facilitate cell death. Based on their multifactorial roles, mitochondria are also critical in the progression of critical illnesses. Transplantation of mitochondria has been reported as a potential promising approach to treat critical illnesses, particularly ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). However, a systematic review of the relevant literature has not been conducted to date. Here, we systematically reviewed the animal and human studies relevant to IRI to summarize the evidence for mitochondrial transplantation. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane library, and Embase and performed a systematic review of mitochondrial transplantation for IRI in both preclinical and clinical studies. We developed a search strategy using a combination of keywords and Medical Subject Heading/Emtree terms. Studies including cell-mediated transfer of mitochondria as a transfer method were excluded. Data were extracted to a tailored template, and data synthesis was descriptive because the data were not suitable for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Overall, we identified 20 animal studies and two human studies. Among animal studies, 14 (70\%) studies focused on either brain or heart IRI. Both autograft and allograft mitochondrial transplantation were used in 17 (85\%) animal studies. The designs of the animal studies were heterogeneous in terms of the route of administration, timing of transplantation, and dosage used. Twelve (60\%) studies were performed in a blinded manner. All animal studies reported that mitochondrial transplantation markedly mitigated IRI in the target tissues, but there was variation in biological biomarkers and pathological changes. The human studies were conducted with a single-arm, unblinded design, in which autologous mitochondrial transplantation was applied to pediatric patients who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for IRI-associated myocardial dysfunction after cardiac surgery. CONCLUSION: The evidence gathered from our systematic review supports the potential beneficial effects of mitochondrial transplantation after IRI, but its clinical translation remains limited. Further investigations are thus required to explore the mechanisms of action and patient outcomes in critical settings after mitochondrial transplantation.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Helminthiases are a group of disabling neglected tropical diseases that affect billions of people worldwide. Current control methods use preventative chemotherapy but reinfection is common and an inter-sectoral approach is required if elimination is to be achieved. Household and community scale water treatment can be used to provide a safe alternative water supply for contact activities, reducing exposure to WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) -related helminths. With the introduction of ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV-C LEDs), ultraviolet (UV) disinfection could be a realistic option for water treatment in low-income regions in the near future, to provide safe alternative water supplies for drinking and contact activities such as handwashing, bathing, and laundry, but currently there is no guidance for the use of UV or solar disinfection against helminths. METHODOLOGY: A qualitative systematic review of existing literature was carried out to establish which WASH-related helminths are more susceptible to UV disinfection and identify gaps in research to inform future studies. The search included all species that can infect humans and can be transmitted through water or wastewater. Five online databases were searched and results were categorized based on the UV source: sunlight and solar simulators, UV-A and UV-B (long wavelength) sources, and UV-C (germicidal) sources. CONCLUSIONS: There has been very little research into the UV sensitivity of helminths; only 47 studies were included in this review and the majority were carried out before the standard protocol for UV disinfection experiments was published. Only 18 species were studied; however all species could be inactivated by UV light. Fluences required to achieve a 1-log inactivation ranged from 5 mJ/cm2 to over 800 mJ/cm2. Larval forms were generally more sensitive to UV light than species which remain as an egg in the environment. This review confirms that further research is required to produce detailed recommendations for household or community scale UV-C LED or solar disinfection (SODIS) of water for preventing helminthiases.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0197658},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) urgently requires effective treatment. Bleomycin-induced lung injury models are characterized by initial inflammation and secondary fibrosis, consistent with the pathological features of IPF. Human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) exhibit good differentiation potential and paracrine activity and are thus ideal for cell-based clinical therapies. The therapeutic effects of hAECs on lung fibrosis are attributed to many factors. We performed a systematic review of preclinical studies investigating the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis with hAECs to provide suggestions for their clinical use. METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched for original studies describing hAEC therapy in animal bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis models. After quality assessments, the number and species of experimental animals, bleomycin dose, hAEC source and dosage, time and route of administration of transplanted cells in animals, and time animals were euthanized in nine controlled preclinical studies were summarized. Ashcroft scores, lung collagen contents, inflammatory cells and cytokines were quantitatively and/or qualitatively analyzed in this review. Publication bias was also assessed. RESULTS: Each of the nine preclinical studies have unique characteristics regarding hAEC use. Ashcroft scores and lung collagen contents were decreased following hAEC transplantation in bleomycin-injured mice. Histopathology was also improved in most studies following treatment with hAECs. hAECs modulated macrophages, neutrophils, T cells, dendritic cells and the mRNA or protein levels of cytokines associated with inflammatory reactions (tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-β, interferon-γ and interleukin) in lung tissues of bleomycin-injured mice. CONCLUSIONS: hAECs alleviate and reverse the progression of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice and may represent a new clinical treatment for IPF. hAECs exert anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects by modulating macrophage, neutrophil, T cell, dendritic cell and related cytokine levels in mice with bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Cell generation and the route, source and timing of hAEC transplantation all determine the therapeutic effectiveness of hAECs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paraquat (PQ) poisoning can cause multiple organ failure, in which the lung is the primary target organ. There is currently no treatment for PQ poisoning. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which differentiate into multiple cell types, have generated much enthusiasm regarding their use for the treatment of several diseases. The aim of this study was to systematically review and analyze published preclinical studies describing MSC administration for the treatment of PQ poisoning in animal models to provide a basis for cell therapy. METHODS: The electronic databases PubMed and CBMdisc were searched in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The MSC treatment characteristics of animal models of PQ poisoning were summarized. After quality assessment was performed, the effects of MSC transplantation were evaluated based on the survival rate, lung wet/dry weight, fibrosis scores, oxidative stress response, and inflammatory response. Publication bias was assessed. RESULTS: Eleven controlled preclinical studies involving MSC transplantation in animal models of PQ poisoning were included in this review. MSC therapy improved the survival rate and reduced the lung wet/dry weight and histopathological fibrosis changes in most studies. MSCs decreased serum or plasma malondialdehyde levels in the acute phase after 7 and 14 d and increased serum or plasma superoxide dismutase and glutathione levels at the same time points. IL-1β, TNF-α and TGF-β1 levels in blood or lung tissues were decreased to different degrees by MSCs. Lung hydroxyproline was decreased by MSCs after 14 d. No obvious evidence of publication bias was found. CONCLUSION: MSCs showed anti-fibrosis therapeutic effects in animal models of lung injury caused by PQ poisoning, which may be related to reduced oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine levels. Our review indicates a potential therapeutic role for MSC therapy to treat PQ poisoning and serves to augment the rationale for clinical studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute liver failure (ALF) has a high mortality varying from 80\% to 85\% with rapid progress in multi-organ system failure. Bioartificial liver (BAL) support systems have the potential to provide temporary support to bridge patients with ALF to liver transplantation or spontaneous recovery. In the past decades, several BAL support systems have been conducted in clinical trials. More recently, concerns have been raised on the renovation of high-quality cell sources and configuration of BAL support systems to provide more benefits to ALF models in preclinical experiments. AIM: To investigate the characteristics of studies about BAL support systems for ALF, and to evaluate their effects on mortality. METHODS: Eligible clinical trials and preclinical experiments on large animals were identified on Cochrane Library, PubMed, and EMbase up to March 6, 2019. Two reviewers independently extracted the necessary information, including key BAL indicators, survival and indicating outcomes, and adverse events during treatment. Descriptive analysis was used to identify the characteristics of the included studies, and a meta-analysis including only randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies was done to calculate the overall effect of BAL on mortality among humans and large animals, respectively. RESULTS: Of the 30 selected studies, 18 were clinical trials and 12 were preclinical experiments. The meta-analysis result suggested that BAL might reduce mortality in ALF in large animals, probably due to the recent improvement of BAL, including the type, cell source, cell mass, and bioreactor, but seemed ineffective for humans [BAL vs control: relative risk (95\% confidence interval), 0.27 (0.12-0.62) for animals and 0.72 (0.48-1.08) for humans]. Liver and renal functions, hematologic and coagulative parameters, encephalopathy index, and neurological indicators seemed to improve after BAL, with neither meaningful adverse events nor porcine endogenous retrovirus infection. CONCLUSION: BAL may reduce the mortality of ALF by bridging the gap between preclinical experiments and clinical trials. Clinical trials using improved BAL must be designed scientifically and conducted in the future to provide evidence for transformation.},

	abstract = {Reconstruction of degenerated temporomandibular joint (TMJ) structures remains a clinical challenge. Tissue engineering (TE) is a promising alternative to current treatment options, where the TMJ is either left without functional components, or replaced with autogenous, allogeneic, or synthetic grafts. The objective of this systematic review was to answer the focused question: in experimental animal models, does the implantation of biomaterial scaffolds loaded with cells and/or growth factors (GFs) enhance regeneration of the discal or osteochondral TMJ tissues, compared with scaffolds alone, without cells, or GFs? Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines, electronic databases were searched for relevant controlled preclinical in vivo studies. Thirty studies reporting TMJ TE strategies in both small (rodents, rabbits; n = 25) and large animals (dogs, sheep, goats; n = 5) reporting histological and/or radiographic outcomes were included. Twelve studies reported ectopic (subcutaneous) implantation models in rodents, whereas 18 studies reported orthotopic, surgically induced defect models in large animals. On average, studies presented with an unclear-to-high risk of bias. In most studies, mesenchymal stem cells or chondrocytes were used in combination with either natural or synthetic polymer scaffolds, aiming for either TMJ disc or condyle regeneration. In summary, the overall preclinical evidence (ectopic [n = 6] and orthotopic TMJ models [n = 6]) indicate that addition of chondrogenic and/or osteogenic cells to biomaterial scaffolds enhances the potential for TMJ tissue regeneration. Standardization of animal models and quantitative outcome evaluations (biomechanical, biochemical, histomorphometric, and radiographic) in future studies, would allow more reliable comparisons and increase the validity of the results.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The zoonotic tapeworm Taenia saginata, although causing only minor discomfort in humans, is responsible for considerable economic losses in the livestock sector due to condemnation or downgrading of infected beef carcasses. An overview of current knowledge on the distribution and prevalence of this parasite in West and Central Africa is lacking. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review, collecting information on published and grey literature about T. saginata taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis from 27 countries/territories in West and Central Africa, published between January 1st, 1990 and December 31st, 2017. RESULTS: The literature search retrieved 1672 records, of which 51 and 45 were retained for a qualitative and quantitative synthesis, respectively. Non-specified human taeniosis cases were described for Nigeria, Cameroon, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic Congo, Guinea, and Ivory Coast (seven out of 27 countries/territories), while T. saginata taeniosis specifically was only reported for Cameroon. Most prevalence estimates for taeniosis ranged between 0-11\%, while three studies from Nigeria reported prevalence estimates ranging between 23-50\%. None of the studies included molecular confirmation of the causative species. The presence of bovine cysticercosis was reported for Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic Congo, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Tristan da Cunha (14 out of 27 countries/territories). Prevalence estimates ranged between 0-29\%. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review has revealed that human taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis are seriously understudied in West and Central Africa. The high prevalence estimates of both conditions suggest an active dissemination of this parasite in the region, calling for a concerted One Health action from public health, veterinary health and food surveillance sectors.},

	abstract = {A variety of antimicrobials and antiparasitics are used to treat British cattle and sheep to ensure animal welfare, a safe food supply, and maintain farm incomes. However, with increasing global concern about antimicrobial resistance in human and animal populations, there is increased scrutiny of the use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals. This systematic review sought to identify and describe peer and non-peer reviewed sources, published over the last ten years, detailing the usage of, and resistance to, antimicrobials and antiparasitics in sheep and cattle farming systems in Britain as well as identify knowledge gaps. Applying the PRISMA review protocol and guidelines for including grey literature; Scopus, Web of Science, Medline, and government repositories were searched for relevant articles and reports. Seven hundred and seventy titles and abstracts and 126 full-text records were assessed, of which 40 scholarly articles and five government reports were included for data extraction. Antibiotic usage in sheep and cattle in Britain appear to be below the UK average for all livestock and tetracyclines and beta-lactam antibiotics were found to be the most commonly used. However, the poor level of coverage afforded to these species compared to other livestock reduced the certainty of these findings. Although resistance to some antibiotics (using Escherichia coli as a marker) appeared to have decreased in sheep and cattle in England and Wales over a five-year period (2013-2018), levels of resistance remain high to commonly used antibiotics. The small number and fragmented nature of studies identified by this review describing anthelmintic usage, and the lack of available national sales data, prevented the identification of trends in either sheep or cattle. We recommend that additional efforts are taken to collect farm or veterinary level data and argue that extraction of this data is imperative to the development of antimicrobial and antiparasitic resistance strategies in Britain, both of which are needed to reduce usage of these anti-infective agents, curb the development of resistance, and safeguard national agricultural production. Finally, metrics produced by this data should be generated in a way to allow for maximum comparability across species, sectors, and countries.},

The application of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) has been suggested as a novel treatment. In this paper, we present systematic reviews of pre-clinical and clinical studies of MSC therapy for second- or third(-)degree thermal burn wounds. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, the PubMed and Embase databases were searched, and interventional studies of MSC therapy using rodent models (21 studies) or human burn patients (three studies) were included in the pre-clinical and clinical reviews, respectively, where both overall outcome and wound-healing-phase-specific methodologies and effects were assessed. The pre-clinical studies demonstrated a promising effect of the application of MSCs on several wound healing phases. The clinical studies also suggested that the MSC treatment was beneficial, particularly in the remodeling phase. However, the limited number of studies, their lack of homogeneity in study design, relatively high risk of bias, lack of reporting on mode of action (MOA), and discontinuity of evidence restrict the strength of these findings. This comprehensive review presents an overview of available methodologies to assess the MOA of MSC treatment for distinct wound healing phases. Furthermore, it includes a set of recommendations for the design of high-quality clinical studies that can determine the efficacy of MSCs as a therapy for burn wounds.},

Mechanisms of action of both methods, however, remain largely elusive. Within this paper, we focus on animal-based experiments in order to investigate the biological mechanisms that are involved in alleviating pain by use of TMS and/or iMCS. Therefore, this paper systematically reviewed the animal-based evidence on these mechanisms. Multiple online databases were systematically searched and retrieved articles were assessed using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Twenty-three suitable articles were included; six on TMS and seventeen on iMCS. In general, iMCS and TMS were found to impact the primary motor cortex structure and function in animals. Furthermore, structural and functional changes within the thalamus, striatum, periaqueductal grey, rostral ventromedial medulla and dorsal horn were reported to occur. Although widespread, all areas in which structural and functional changes occurred after TMS and iMCS have been found to be interconnected anatomically. This could provide a rationale for future investigations of treating neuropathic pain by use of neuromodulation.},

The International Federation of Horseracing Authorities recently introduced international residue limits (IRLs) to facilitate the discrimination between pharmacological relevant and irrelevant concentrations in doping samples. The objective of this study was to investigate the scientific validity of these IRLs. A systematic analysis was performed to assess the IRLs by different statistical approaches using published pharmacokinetic data. 31 out of 218 potentially relevant publications met the inclusion criteria. Thereby, both IRLs were found to be appropriate for the exclusion of the presence of a relevant pharmacological effect after a wilful application. The IRL of theophylline was also determined to be suitable for the prevention of positive doping tests caused by the ingestion of contaminated feed. In contrast, the IRL of caffeine is not suitable to prevent positive doping test caused by the ingestion of more than 10 mg caffeine per day per horse with contaminated feed. The lack of corresponding regulation for paraxanthine, a major active metabolite of caffeine and theophylline, was recognised as a substantial shortcoming of the current system, rendering both IRLs incomplete.},

Our aim was to conduct a systematic review of clinical and preclinical studies that evaluated biological augmentation of graft healing in ACLR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all, 1879 studies were identified across three databases. Following assessment against strict criteria, 112 studies were included (20 clinical studies; 92 animal studies). RESULTS: Seven categories of biological interventions were identified: growth factors, biomaterials, stem cells, gene therapy, autologous tissue, biophysical/environmental, and pharmaceuticals. The methodological quality of animal studies was moderate in 97\%, but only 10\% used clinically relevant outcome measures. The most interventions in clinical trials target the graft-tunnel interface and are applied intraoperatively. Platelet-rich plasma is the most studied intervention, but the clinical outcomes are mixed, and the methodological quality of studies was suboptimal. Other biological therapies investigated in clinical trials include: remnant-augmented ACLR; bone substitutes; calcium phosphate-hybridized grafts; extracorporeal shockwave therapy; and adult autologus non-cultivated stem cells. CONCLUSION: There is extensive preclinical research supporting the use of biological therapies to augment ACLR. Further clinical studies that meet the minimum standards of reporting are required to determine whether emerging biological strategies will provide tangible benefits in patients undergoing ACLR.

	abstract = {Objectives. Dracocephalum has over 60 species and is found mainly in the temperate regions of Asia and Europe. One of these species, i.e., Dracocephalum kotschyi Boiss, is known to have a number of medicinal properties and active ingredients in many parts of the world. Despite being an endemic wild-flowering plant of great importance, the plant is currently considered endangered in Iran. Besides, there is paucity of information on the significance of the medicinal properties and active constituents of D. kotschyi among the Iranian people. On that account a systematic review of studies reporting on the medicinal properties and active ingredients and its significance to human and animal health was conducted and the existing knowledge gaps were identified. Methods. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used in the search for published articles on medicinal properties and active ingredients of D. kotschyi and its significance on humans and animals in Iran. The search was confined to scientific articles from repositories of popular data bases and search engines among them PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Science Direct, SpringerLink, and Scopus. The search narrowed down on scientific journals, books, and book chapters focusing on the medicinal properties of D. kotschyi in Iran for the period between 1970 and 2018. Results. A total of 1158 scientific articles were sourced from the various databases, out of which 38 met the search criteria and qualified for this review. The studies were conducted in only 9 of the 31 provinces of Iran, with a large proportion in Isfahan province, central Iran. The studies showed that all plant parts (roots, aerial parts, flowers, and leaves) had active constituents. Essential oils and aerial plant parts were the main components studied. Nevertheless, the most frequently reported constituents were xanthomicrol, limonene, luteolin, geranial, apigenin, and calycopterin. A number of medicinal properties were reported among them antioxidant, antibacterial, anticancerous, antinociceptive, antihyperlipidemic, antispasmodic, cytotoxic, and immunomodulatory effects. The plant was also reported to be a remedy for inflammatory pain, headaches, congestion, liver disorders, ulcer, fever, renal pain, dyspepsia, stomach ache, abdominal pain, joints pains, muscle spasm, congestion, bloating, and wound healing effects, among others. Conclusion. This review has shown that D. kotschyi is an important medicinal plant with a large number of active constituents and great potential to safeguard human and animal health in Iran. However, over utilization of the D. kotschyi plant is already endangering its existence. Nevertheless, more studies need be conducted across the country.},

	abstract = {In the present meta-analysis, reductions in the risk of hip fracture with milk consumption were only observed among American adults, but not among Scandinavian adults, possibly because milk products are more commonly fortified with vitamin D in the former population than in Scandinavian countries. The reduction in the risk of hip fracture was also observed with yogurt consumption, which is often associated with healthy lifestyles and dietary patterns that contribute to improved bone health. INTRODUCTION: Although dairy products contain bone-beneficial nutrients, the association between dairy consumption and the risk of hip fracture remains equivocal. Fueling this uncertainty, the elevated risk of hip fracture in association with milk consumption was observed in a cohort of Swedish women. A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies was performed to critically evaluate the association, or lack thereof, between dairy consumption (milk, yogurt, and cheese) and the risk of hip fracture. METHODS: A random effects model was used to generate the summary relative risks (RRs) with their 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations of interest. RESULTS: In the meta-analysis of the highest versus lowest category of consumption, higher consumption of yogurt (RR 0.78, 95\% CI 0.68, 0.90), but not milk (RR 0.86, 95\% CI 0.73, 1.02) or cheese (RR 0.85, 95\% CI 0.66, 1.08), was associated with a lower risk of hip fracture. For milk, the reduced risk of fracture with higher milk consumption was observed in the USA (RR 0.75, 95\% CI 0.65, 0.87), but not in Scandinavian countries (RR 1.00, 95\% CI 0.85, 1.17). These findings were further supported by the fact that American studies (RR 0.93, 95\% CI 0.88, 0.98; per 1 glass/day), but not Scandinavian studies (RR 1.01, 95\% CI 0.95, 1.07; per 1 glass/day), demonstrated a linear association between milk consumption and the risk of hip fracture. CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative evidence from prospective cohort studies reassuringly suggests that the risk of hip fracture may not be elevated among people who consume milk, yogurt, and cheese, and that a greater consumption of milk or yogurt may even be associated with a lower risk of hip fracture depending on the factors that may differ across the population of interest.},

	abstract = {Background: Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne virus transmitted by mosquitoes from the Aedes genus. The virus, endemic to parts of Asia and Africa, has recently undergone an emergence in other parts of the world where it was previously not found including Indian Ocean Islands, Europe, the Western Pacific and the Americas. There is no vaccine against chikungunya virus, which means that prevention and mitigation rely on personal protective measures and community level interventions including vector control. Methodology/Principal findings: A systematic review (SR) was conducted to summarize the literature on individual and community mitigation and control measures and their effectiveness. From a scoping review of the global literature on chikungunya, there were 91 articles that investigated mitigation or control strategies identified at the individual or community level. Of these, 81 were confirmed as relevant and included in this SR. The majority of the research was published since 2010 (76.5\%) and was conducted in Asia (39.5\%). Cross sectional studies were the most common study design (36.6\%). Mitigation measures were placed into six categories: behavioural protective measures, insecticide use, public education, control of blood and blood products, biological vector control and quarantine of infected individuals. The effectiveness of various mitigation measures was rarely evaluated and outcomes were rarely quantitative, making it difficult to summarize results across studies and between mitigation strategies. Meta-analysis of the proportion of individuals engaging in various mitigation measures indicates habitat removal is the most common measure used, which may demonstrate the effectiveness of public education campaigns aimed at reducing standing water. Conclusions/Significance: Further research with appropriate and consistent outcome measurements are required in order to determine which mitigation measures, or combination of mitigation measures, are the most effective at protecting against exposure to chikungunya virus.},

TYPE: Systematic review. LITERATURE SURVEY: A comprehensive search of studies was performed in 4 electronic databases (Cochrane, PubMed, PEDro, and Web of Science) regarding the effects of equine-assisted therapies and horse riding simulation exercise in older adults. Eight articles were selected, 5 of them focused on hippotherapy, 2 on horse riding simulation, and a single article that used the 2 types of therapy. METHODOLOGY: PRISMA guidelines were followed for the data extraction process. SYNTHESIS: The studies were all randomized controlled trials, but not double-blind, so they were classified as level of evidence B. Duration of hippotherapy programs ranged from 8-12 weeks. Sessions lasted between 15 and 60 minutes and were performed 2-5 times per week. Interventions using a horse simulator spanned 8 weeks and were conducted for 20 minutes 5 times per week. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that hippotherapy might improve balance, mobility, gait ability, and muscle strength, as well as could induce hormonal and cerebral activity changes in healthy older adults. Benefits of horse riding simulation could be limited to physical fitness and muscular activity. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: I.},

Recent trials have suggested that its effect on long-term functional outcome is neutral or negative, despite apparently promising pre-clinical data. Systematic review and meta-analysis is a useful tool to collate experimental data and investigate the basis of its conclusions. We searched three online databases to identify studies testing systemic hypothermia as monotherapy for treatment of animals subjected to a TBI. Data pertaining to TBI paradigm, animal subjects, and hypothermia management were extracted as well as those relating to risk of bias. We pooled outcome data where sufficient numbers allowed and investigated heterogeneity in neurobehavioral outcomes using multi-variate meta-regression. We identified 90 publications reporting 272 experiments testing hypothermia in animals subject to TBI. The subjects were mostly small animals, with well-established models predominating. Target temperature was comparable to clinical trial data but treatment was initiated very early. Study quality was low and there was some evidence of publication bias. Delay to treatment, comorbidity, and blinded outcome assessment appeared to predict neurobehavioral outcome on multi-variate meta-regression. Therapeutic hypothermia appears to be an efficacious treatment in experimental TBI, which differs from the clinical evidence. The pre-clinical literature showed limitations in quality and design and these both appeared to affect neurobehavioral experiment outcome. These should be acknowledged when designing and interpreting pre-clinical TBI studies in the future.},

	abstract = {Sports-related head trauma has emerged as an important public health issue, as mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) may result in neurodegenerative disorders such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Research into mTBI and CTE pathophysiology are difficult to undertake in athletes, with observational trials and post-mortem analysis the current mainstays. Thus, animal models play an important role in the study of mTBI, however, traditional animal models have focused on acute, severe injuries rather than the more typical mTBI's seen in sport injuries. Recently, a number of animal models have been developed that are both appropriately scaled and biomechanically relevant to the forces sustained by athletes. This review aimed to examine the literature for variables included in these animal models, and the resulting neurotrauma as evidenced by pathology and behavioral deficits. A systematic search of the literature was performed in multiple electronic databases. The inclusion criteria required mimicry of athlete mTBI conditions: freedom of head movement, lack of surgical alteration of the skull, and application of direct contact force. Studies were analyzed for variables including apparatus design features (impact force, change in animal head velocity, and kinetic energy transfer to the head), demonstrated pathology (phosphorylated tau, TDP-43 aggregation, diffuse axonal injury, gliosis, cytokine inflammation response, and genetic integrity), and behavioral changes. These studies suggested that appropriate animal models can assist in understanding the pathological and functional outcomes of athlete mTBI, and could be used as a platform for future studies of diagnostic/prognostic markers and in the development of treatment interventions.},

	abstract = {Studies of racehorse injury or fatality in various countries have identified common, and in some cases conflicting, risk factors. We conducted a systematic search of the relevant literature published from 1990 to 2017. Peer-reviewed articles were included if they reported the incidence of fatal or catastrophic musculoskeletal injury (CMI) in Thoroughbred flat races (n=21) or risk factors for CMI (n=65). Pooled effect sizes were estimated using the random-effects DerSimonian-Laird model. The pooled incidence of CMI was 1.17 (95\% confidence interval 0.90, 1.44) per 1000 race starts. Almost 300 factors have been investigated in epidemiological studies for potential associations with CMI. Factors found to have consistent evidence of increasing risk of CMI are: (1) Horse-level factors such as older horse age and age at first start, male sex, and higher race class or lower claiming price; (2) Race-level factors such as firmer track conditions on turf and wetter conditions on dirt, longer race distance, and a greater number of starters; and (3) Management-related factors including more time since previous start, greater number of starts, longer career length, issues identified at pre-race examination, previous injury, and recent administration of medication or injections. Studies investigating recent cumulative distance of high-speed exercise were conflicting and suggestive of at least two mechanisms of injury related to the accumulation of bone damage: (1) In well adapted bone following a period of intense training; and (2) In poorly adapted bone at relatively low levels of training intensity. Future studies should evaluate success of interventions and mechanisms for injury.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Low sanitary conditions characterize the rural and urban households in Sub-Saharan African region. Those environmental conditions propitiate the transmission of bacterial infections between animals and humans. Campylobacter spp. is a zoonotic bacterium and cause of human gastroenteritis worldwide, whose main symptom is diarrhea. It is normally found in the digestive tract of many farm animals as a commensal but some species cause diseases in animals. It is important to understand the occurrence of these bacteria in animals, as they may also play a role in transmission to humans. The main objective of this review was to describe the prevalence of Campylobacter in animals in Sub-Saharan Africa. We also report findings on antibiotic resistance. METHODS: We followed PRISMA guidelines to find studies about occurrence of Campylobacter spp. in animals in all countries from Sub-Saharan Africa. PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, African Index Medicus, African Journals Online, Google Scholar and Science Direct were searched for studies published between 2000 and 2019. RESULTS: We found 70 studies that described occurrence of Campylobacter spp. in animals in 18 out of 53 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa. Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli were the predominant species isolated. The majority of studies were found in Western Africa. Middle Africa had the lowest amount of data. Most records presented data from Nigeria (n = 25), South Africa (n = 14) and Tanzania (n = 11). Cattle and chickens appear to be important hosts and may be playing an important role in transmitting to humans. Most Campylobacter isolates were resistant to erythromycin (44\%), ampicillin (39\%), tetracycline (33\%), nalidixic acid (31\%) and ciprofloxacin (30\%). CONCLUSION: Several studies about Campylobacter spp. in animals have been published in the last 19 years but information on the epidemiology of campylobacteriosis is scarce in most Sub-Saharan African countries. Antibiotic resistance is an increasing concern in many countries. Measures should be taken to prevent infection by this pathogen in the region and to control antibiotic resistance.},

	abstract = {Synanthropic rodents are important urban pests that frequently carry hematophagous ectoparasites. These blood-sucking pests are capable of transmitting epizootic and zoonotic pathogens by landing on one host after feeding on an infected animal. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of ectoparasites carried by synanthropic rodents and discuss the pathogens that are associated with these external parasites. We searched relevant literatures using predefined criteria in the following databases: EMBASE, PUBMED, Web of Science and Scopus from January 2000 to June 2020. Quality of studies was evaluated using Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). Of 35 included studies from 15 countries in Africa, America, Asia, Europe and Oceania, black rats (R. rattus), brown rats (R. norvegicus), pacific rats (R. exulans) and house mice (Mus musculus) were common synanthropic rodents. Mites (Mesostigmata, Sarcoptiformes and Trombidiformes) were the most prevalent (42.6\%, 95\% CI 26-59.2), followed by ticks (Ixodida) (21.5\%, 95\% CI 10.5-32.6), lice (Phthiraptera) (17.8\%, 95\% CI 7.7-27.9) and fleas (Siphonaptera) (14.1\%, 95\% CI 10.1-18.1). Heterogeneity (I(2){\textgreater}96\%) across studies was statistically significant. The ectoparasitic fauna was shared considerably by different urban rodent species and appeared to be more diverse in R. rattus and R. norvegicus. Nonetheless, pathogens carried by these ectoparasites were rarely investigated. In conclusion, ectoparasites are ubiquitous in urban-dwelling rodents but our understanding of the epidemiology and the associated pathogens of these parasites remains limited. Further studies are warranted to unravel the pathogen landscape found in rodent-associated ectoparasites.},

DESIGN: Systematic review of experimental (non-human) studies assessing cognitive effects of RAS peptides angiotensin-(3-8) [Ang IV] and angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] and their receptors, the Ang IV receptor (AT4R) and the Mas receptor. RESULTS: Of 450 articles identified, 32 met inclusion criteria. Seven of 11 studies of normal animals found Ang IV had beneficial effects on tests of passive or conditioned avoidance and object recognition. In models of cognitive deficit, eight of nine studies found Ang IV and its analogs (Nle(1)-Ang IV, dihexa, LVV-hemorphin-7) improved performance on spatial working memory and passive avoidance tasks. Two of three studies examining Ang-(1-7) found it benefited memory. Mas receptor removal was associated with reduced fear memory in one study. CONCLUSION: Studies of cognitive impairment show salutary effects of acute administration of Ang IV and its analogs, as well as AT4R activation. Brain RAS peptides appear most effective administered intracerebroventricularly, close to the time of learning acquisition or retention testing. Ang-(1-7) shows anti-dementia qualities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human psittacosis, caused by Chlamydia (C.) psittaci, is likely underdiagnosed and underreported, since tests for C. psittaci are often not included in routine microbiological diagnostics. Source tracing traditionally focuses on psittacine pet birds, but recently other animal species have been gaining more attention as possible sources for human psittacosis. This review aims to provide an overview of all suspected animal sources of human psittacosis cases reported in the international literature. In addition, for each animal species the strength of evidence for zoonotic transmission was estimated. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using four databases (Pubmed, Embase, Scopus and Proquest). Articles were included when there was mention of at least one human case of psittacosis and a possible animal source. Investigators independently extracted data from the included articles and estimated strength of evidence for zoonotic transmission, based on a self-developed scoring system taking into account number of human cases, epidemiological evidence and laboratory test results in human, animals, and the environment. RESULTS: Eighty articles were included, which provided information on 136 different situations of possible zoonotic transmission. The maximum score for zoonotic transmission was highest for turkeys, followed by ducks, owls, and the category 'other poultry'. Articles reporting about zoonotic transmission from unspecified birds, psittaciformes and columbiformes provided a relatively low strength of evidence. A genotypical match between human and animal samples was reported twenty-eight times, including transmission from chickens, turkeys, guinea fowl, peafowl, pigeons, ducks, geese, songbirds, parrot-like birds and owls. CONCLUSIONS: Strong evidence exists for zoonotic transmission from turkeys, chickens and ducks, in addition to the more traditionally reported parrot-like animal sources. Based on our scoring system, the evidence was generally stronger for poultry than for parrot-like birds. Psittaciformes should not be disregarded as an important source of human psittacosis, still clinicians and public health officials should include poultry and birds species other than parrots in medical history and source tracing.},

	abstract = {Our understanding of chemical communication between social insect queens and workers has advanced rapidly in recent years. Several studies have identified chemicals produced by queens and other fertile females that apparently induce sterility in other colony members. However, other experiments produced nonsignificant results, leading some to argue either that earlier reports were mistaken, or that some queen pheromones only work in specific contexts. Here, I review the experimental evidence using meta-analysis, and show that there is near-universal support for the hypothesis that fertility-related chemicals cause sterility regardless of context; studies finding otherwise can be explained most parsimoniously as false negatives. Additionally, queen pheromone experiments that were not performed blind recorded much stronger effect sizes, suggesting bias. I conclude by highlighting several outstanding questions in the field, and by offering recommendations for future studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become an emerging issue in the developing countries as well as in Bangladesh. AMR is aggravated by irrational use of antimicrobials in a largely unregulated pluralistic health system. This review presents a 'snap shot' of the current situation including existing policies and practices to address AMR, and the challenges and barriers associated with their implementation. METHODS: A systematic approach was adopted for identifying, screening, and selecting relevant literature on AMR situation in Bangladesh. We used Google Scholar, Pubmed, and Biomed Central databases for searching peer-reviewed literature in human, animal and environment sectors during January 2010-August 2019, and Google for grey materials from the institutional and journal websites. Two members of the study team independently reviewed these documents for inclusion in the analysis. We used a 'mixed studies review' method for synthesizing evidences from different studies. RESULT: Of the final 47 articles, 35 were primary research, nine laboratory-based research, two review papers and one situation analysis report. Nineteen articles on human health dealt with prescribing and/or use of antimicrobials, five on self-medication, two on non-compliance of dosage, and 10 on the sensitivity and resistance patterns of antibiotics. Four papers focused on the use of antimicrobials in food animals and seven on environmental contamination. Findings reveal widespread availability of antimicrobials without prescription in the country including rise in its irrational use across sectors and consequent contamination of environment and spread of resistance. The development and transmission of AMR is deep-rooted in various supply and demand side factors. Implementation of existing policies and strategies remains a challenge due to poor awareness, inadequate resources and absence of national surveillance. CONCLUSION: AMR is a multi-dimensional problem involving different sectors, disciplines and stakeholders requiring a One Health comprehensive approach for containment.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Many animal studies have evaluated the role of vitamins in the recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury, but their results have been contradictory and no consensus has been reached. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effects of vitamin C and vitamin E on recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury in animal models. DATA SOURCES: Two authors independently collected the records of relevant articles published in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science through November 2018. STUDY SELECTION: All studies conducted in animal models to evaluate the therapeutic effects of vitamin C or vitamin E or both on recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury were included. Studies that lacked a control group or a standard treatment, lacked an assessment of motor function, included genetically modified/engineered animals, included animals pretreated with vitamin C or vitamin E, or combined vitamin treatment with other methods, such as cell therapies, were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION: Data from 10 articles met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis, conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Daily supplementation with vitamin C (P {\textless} 0.0001) and vitamin E (P {\textless} 0.0001) significantly improved the recovery of motor function in animals affected by spinal cord injury. Vitamin C supplementation is effective only when administered intraperitoneally (P {\textless} 0.0001). Concurrent supplementation with both vitamins does not show better efficacy than treatment with either one alone. CONCLUSION: Administration of vitamin C and vitamin E in animal models of spinal cord injury significantly improves the recovery of motor function.},

	abstract = {The liver flukes, Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica, are common trematode parasites of livestock. F. hepatica is known to modulate the immune response, including altering the response to co-infecting pathogens. Bovine tuberculosis (bTB), caused by Mycobacterium bovis, is a chronic disease which is difficult to control and is of both animal welfare and public health concern. Previous research has suggested that infection with liver fluke may affect the accuracy of the bTB skin test, but direction of the effect differs between studies. In a systematic review of the literature, all experimental and observational studies concerning co-infection with these two pathogens were sought. Data were extracted on the association between fluke infection and four measures of bTB diagnosis or pathology, namely, the bTB skin test, interferon γ test, lesion detection and culture/bacterial recovery. Of a large body of literature dating from 1950 to 2019, only thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. These included studies of experimentally infected calves, case control studies on adult cows, cross sectional abattoir studies and a herd level study. All the studies had a medium or high risk of bias. The balance of evidence from the 13 studies included in the review suggests that liver fluke exposure was associated with either no effect or a decreased response to all of the four aspects of bTB diagnosis assessed: skin test, IFN γ, lesion detection and mycobacteria cultured or recovered. Most studies showed a small and/or non-significant effect so the clinical and practical importance of the observed effect is likely to be modest, although it could be more significant in particular groups of animals, such as dairy cattle.},

	abstract = {Background: Rhein is considered to have beneficial influence on diabetic nephropathy. Animal experiments suggested that the mechanisms of rhein against diabetic nephropathy may involve many processes, but the credibility of the evidence is unclear. Therefore, we conducted systematic review and meta-analysis of pre-clinical animal data to assess the current evidence for rhein effects and mechanisms in treating diabetic nephropathy. Methods: The databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP information database, Wanfang Data Information Site, and Chinese Biomedical Literature were searched for this review. SYRCLE's risk of bias tool for animal studies was applied to assess the methodological quality of studies. A meta-analysis was performed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions by using RevMan 5.3 and STATA/SE 12.0 software. This study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018105220. Results: Twenty-five studies involving 537 animals were included. There was significant association of rhein with levels of blood glucose (P {\textless} 0.05), serum creatinine (Scr) (P {\textless} 0.05), urine protein (P {\textless} 0.05), kidney tubules injury index (P {\textless} 0.05), relative area of kidney collagen (P {\textless} 0.05), transforming growth factor-β(1) (P {\textless} 0.05), malondialdehyde (P {\textless} 0.05), and superoxide dismutase (P {\textless} 0.05) compared with that in the control group. No significant association between rhein and endothelin (P {\textgreater} 0.05) was found. Subgroup analysis showed that the hypoglycemic effect of rhein on type 2 diabetic nephropathy was better than on type 1 diabetic nephropathy (P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions: These findings suggested that rhein has beneficial effects on animal models of diabetic nephropathy, and that the mechanisms are mostly involved with ameliorating levels of TGF-β(1), renal fibrosis, metabolism, and oxidative stress status. However, some factors such as possible publication bias, methodological quality, and sample size may affect the accuracy of positive findings. These limitations suggested that a cautious interpretation of the positive results of this systematic review and meta-analysis is necessary. Therefore, high methodological quality and well-reported animal experiments are needed in future research.},

METHODS: Articles were identified in PubMed, EMBASE and the Web of Science and were included if they evaluated the effect of IH on the changes in the infarcted area after AMI in rats. RESULTS: A preliminary search identified 3633 articles and 29 data sets from 23 articles (12 in vivo, 16 in vitro). The IS decreased after AMI in IH rats both in vitro (SMD -1.46, 95\% CI [- 2.37, - 0.55]; I(2) = 85.6\%, P = 0.000) and in vivo (SMD -1.43, 95\% CI [- 2.05, - 0.82], I(2) = 73.6\%, P = 0.000). Sensitivity analysis indicated that IH had a strong protective effect against myocardial infarction, and the hypoxia concentration was significantly correlated with the change in IS after AMI. CONCLUSION: IH can reduce IS after AMI in rats. This effect of IH may be related to the dose of hypoxia, and the oxygen concentration may be one of the most important influencing factors.},

However, the advantage of RVATS compared to VATS is still under investigation. The results are unclear. AIM: The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of Robot-assisted Thoracic Surgery (RATS) lobectomy versus Video-assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) for lobectomy in patients with Non- Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: A systematic electronic search of online electronic databases: Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane library updated in June 2017. The meta-analysis was performed including the studies are designed as randomized or non- randomized controlled. RESULTS: Twenty retrospective cohort studies met our inclusion criteria. The pooled analysis of mortality showed that RATS lobectomy significantly reduced the mortality rate when compared with VATS lobectomy (RR =0.53, 95\% CI 0.37 - 0.76; P = 0.0005). With the pooled result of duration of surgery indicated that RATS has a tendency towards longer surgery time (SMD= 0.52, 95\% CI 0.23- 0.81; P {\textless} 0.0004=). However, the meta-analysis on the median length of hospital stay (MD =0.00, 95\% CI -0.03 - 0.03; P = 0.91), number of dissected lymph nodes station (SMD =0.39, 95\% CI -0.60 - 1.38; P = 0.44), the number of removed lymph nodes (SMD =0.98, 95\% CI -0.61 - 2.56; P = 0.23), mean duration of drainage (SMD =0.29, 95\% CI -0.15 - 0.73; P = 0.20), prolonged air leak (RR =1.01, 95\% CI 0.84 - 1.21; P = 0.93), arrhythmia (RR =1.06, 95\% CI 0.88 - 1.26; P = 0.54) (P= 0.54), pneumonia (RR =0.89, 95\% CI 0.69 - 1.13; P = 0.33), the incidence of conversion (RR =0.82, 95\% CI 0.54 - 1.26; P = 0.37) and morbidity (RR =1.05, 95\% CI 0.90 - 1.23; P = 0.055) all showed no significant differences between RATS and VATS lobectomy. CONCLUSIONS: RATS result in better mortality as compared with VATS. However, robotics seems to have longer operative time and higher hospital costs, without superior advantages in morbidity rates and oncologic efficiency. Since the advantages of RATS has been performed in some area, the continuation of a comparative investigation with VATS may be necessary. And some efforts need to be taken into consideration to reduce the operative time and cost.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113306},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to particulate matters (PM) is recognized as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. A change in cardiac autonomic function is one postulated mechanism leading to PM related cardiovascular events. This study therefore evaluated the associations of short-term exposure to PM and heart rate variability (HRV) parameters, which can reflect the cardiac autonomic function. METHODS: Four electronic databases were searched for controlled studies of rodents published prior to December 2018. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Effect sizes were calculated for five main HRV parameters, including standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), square root of mean squared differences between successive normal-to-normal intervals (rMSSD), low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and the ratio of LF and HF (LF/HF). RESULTS: The review included 23 studies with 401 animals. Short-term exposure to PM by instillation yielded statistically significant effects on SDNN (Standardized Mean Difference [SMD] = -1.11, 95\% Confidence Intervals [CI] = -2.22 to -0.01, P = 0.05), LF (SMD = -1.19, 95\% CI = -1.99 to -0.40, P = 0.003) and LF/HF (SMD = -1.05, 95\% CI = -2.03 to -0.07, P = 0.04). Short-term exposure to PM by inhalation only yielded statistically significant effect on LF/HF (SMD = -0.83, 95\% CI = -1.39 to -0.27, P = 0.004). There was no evidence that animal model and exposure frequency influenced the relationship of PM and HRV. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exposure to PM can decrease HRV of rodents, affecting cardiac autonomic function. Exposure methods can influence the relationships of PM and HRV parameters. Further studies should focus on the effects of long-term PM exposure, on human beings, and potential influential factors of PM-HRV associations.},

However, the reported therapeutic efficacy was inconsistent among studies. To evaluate this situation, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched for preclinical studies using NSPC intraparenchymal transplantation in ischemic stroke animals. Data of study quality score, neurobehavioral (mNSS, rotarod test, and cylinder test) and histological (infarct volume) outcomes, cell therapy-related serious adverse events, and related cellular mechanisms were extracted for meta-analysis and systematic review. A total of 62 studies containing 73 treatment arms were included according to our criterion, with a mean quality score of 5.10 in 10. Among these studies, almost half of the studies claimed no adverse events of tumorigenesis. The finally pooled effect sizes for neurobehavioral and histological assessments were large (1.27 for mNSS, 1.63 for the rotarod test, 0.71 for the cylinder test, and 1.11 for infarct volume reduction). With further analysis, it was found that the administration time poststroke, NSPC donor species, and transplantation immunogenicity had close correlations with the degree of infarct volume reduction. The NSPC dosage delivered into the brain parenchyma was also negatively correlated with the effect of the cylinder test. Intriguingly, endogenous apoptosis inhibition and axonal regeneration played the most critical role in intraparenchymal NSPC transplantation among the cellular mechanisms. These results indicate that intraparenchymal NSPC transplantation is beneficial for neurobehavioral and histological improvement and is relatively safe for ischemic stroke animals. Therefore, intraparenchymal NSPC transplantation is a promising treatment for stroke patients.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infects both humans and animals. Swine has been confirmed to be the principal natural reservoir, which raises a concern that HEV infection would be substantially increasing among swine workers. The present study calculated the pooled prevalence of IgG antibodies against HEV among swine workers and the general population in previous cross-sectional studies. We conducted a meta-analysis comparing the prevalence of HEV infection between swine workers and the general population, including local residents, blood donors and non-swine workers. Through searches in three databases (PubMed and OVID in English, and CNKI in Chinese) and after study selection, a total of 32 studies from 16 countries (from 1999 through 2018) were included in the meta-analysis. A random-effect model was employed in the study; an I (2) statistic assessed heterogeneity, and the Egger's test detected publication bias. The comparative prevalence of anti-HEV IgG was pooled from the studies. Compared to the general population, the prevalence ratio (PR) for swine workers was estimated to be 1.52 (95\% CI 1.38-1.76) with the I (2) being 71\%. No publication bias was detected (p = 0.40). A subgroup analysis further indicated increased prevalence of anti-HEV IgG in the swine workers in Asia (PR = 1.49, 95\% CI: 1.35-1.64), in Europe (PR = 1.93, 95\% CI: 1.49-2.50) and in all five swine-related occupations, including swine farmers, butchers, meat processors, pork retailers and veterinarians (PR ranged between 1.19 and 1.75). In summary, swine workers have a relatively higher prevalence of past HEV infection, and this finding is true across swine-related occupations, which confirms zoonotic transmission between swine and swine workers.},

Five electronic databases were systematically searched to identify relevant articles published from 1 January 2011 to 1 December 2019. The pooled rates with 95\% confidence interval (CI) were calculated by a fixed-effect or random-effect model analysis. The results showed that 92 articles were included in this meta-analysis. For the confirmed SFTS cases, the case-fatality rate was 0.15 (95\% CI 0.11, 0.18). Two hundred and ninety-six of 1384 SFTS patients indicated that they had been bitten by ticks and the biting rate was 0.21 (95\% CI 0.16, 0.26). The overall pooled seroprevalence of SFTSV antibodies among the healthy population was 0.04 (95\% CI 0.03, 0.05). For the overall seroprevalence of SFTSV in animals, the seroprevalence of SFTSV was 0.25 (95\% CI 0.20, 0.29). The infection rate of SFTSV in ticks was 0.08 (95\% CI 0.05, 0.11). In conclusion, ticks can serve as transmitting vectors of SFTSVs and reservoir hosts. Animals can be infected by tick bites, and as a reservoir host, SFTSV circulates continuously between animals and ticks in nature.

Studies show various biological effects of fasudil in the cardiovascular system. We conducted a preclinical systematic review to determine the efficacy and possible mechanisms of fasudil on animal models of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Nineteen studies involving 400 animals were identified after searching 8 databases for articles published till June 2018. The methodological quality was assessed by the Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies (CAMARADES) 10-item checklist. The data were analyzed using Rev-Man 5.3 software, and the score of study quality ranged from 3 to 6 points. Compared to the control group, fasudil treated animals showed reduced myocardial infarct size (P {\textless} 0.05), lower levels of cardiac enzymes (P {\textless} 0.05) and cardiac troponin T (P {\textless} 0.05), improved systolic and diastolic functions (P {\textless} 0.05), and increased degree of decline in the ST-segment (P {\textless} 0.05). The possible mechanisms of fasudil action against myocardial I/R injury are improvement in coronary vasodilation, inhibition of apoptosis and oxidative stress, relieving inflammation, and reduction in endoplasmic reticulum stress and metabolism. In conclusion, fasudil exerts a cardio-protective function through multiple signaling pathways in animal models of myocardial I/R injury.},

The aim of this systematic literature review (SLR) was to investigate the effect of companion animals (whether simply as pets or used in more formal intervention approaches) on the physical and mental health of older adults (aged 60+). METHODS: . The reviewers identified key search terms and conducted a systematic search of the PsycINFO and PubMed databases. The 70 articles reviewed were evaluated through tabular and thematic analysis. RESULTS: . In 52 of the studies examined, companion animals positively contributed to the mental and/or physical health of older adults. With respect to mental health, involvement with a companion animal improved participant quality of life and effectively attenuated symptoms of depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, and the behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD). In relation to physical health, marked increases in physical activity and improvements in blood pressure and heart rate variability were the only consistent physical health improvements observed from companion animal interactions. CONCLUSIONS: . Animal companionship can benefit the mental and physical health of older adults, although more and better controlled research on this topic is required. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: . Use of companion animals has the potential to be an effective treatment or adjunct therapy to improve the health status and quality of life of older individuals.},

	abstract = {There are several biological factors that might play a role in physiological response to opioids and/or the onset of problematic opioid use; however, sex-based differences in non-analgesic opioid-based effects are poorly understood. The goal of this review is to provide a current analysis of the pre-clinical literature on sex-based differences in response to endogenous and exogenous opioids, including the interplay between sex hormones and opioid receptor-mediated neuronal activity and associated behaviours. A systematic search was performed on the following terms within PubMed between March and April 2018: 'opioid oestrogen', 'opioid progesterone', 'opioid oestradiol', and 'opioid testosterone'. Pre-clinical research on the non-analgesic, sex-based effects of opioids is disparate, both in terms of methodology and outcomes, which prohibits a cohesive summary of the results. Themes from the pre-clinical literature suggest that opioid receptor binding, coupling, and density vary as a function of hormone exposure. Findings also suggest that interactions between endogenous opioid and stress systems may differ between males and females as a function of ovarian hormones. Given the current opioid-related public health crisis, there is a pressing need to increase systematic pre-clinical and clinical research on sex-based differences in opioid-effects and opioid use disorder.},

	abstract = {The objectives were to review the published literature and use meta-analytic methods to determine the effects of dietary protein fed prepartum on productive performance of dairy cows. The hypothesis was that responses to dietary protein prepartum would differ between nulliparous and parous cows, and performance would be maximized at a greater protein supply in nulliparous than in parous cows. The literature was systematically reviewed, searching randomized experiments in which the prepartum dietary content or degradability of protein was manipulated. Twenty-seven experiments including 125 treatment means and 1,801 cows were included in the meta-analysis. Of those, 8 experiments with 27 treatment means reported responses for 510 nulliparous cows. Data collected included the ingredient composition and chemical analyses of prepartum diets, parity group, and means and respective measures of variance for productive responses. Mixed model meta-analysis was conducted and statistical models investigated the effects of dietary crude protein (CP) or supply of metabolizable protein (MP) prepartum on performance. Supply of MP was predicted using the National Research Council Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle (2001) model. The mean ± standard deviation and median (range) concentrations of dietary CP fed to cows prepartum were 14.4 ± 2.2 and 14.4\% (8.9 to 20.9\%), resulting in mean and median (range) intakes of CP prepartum of 1,720 ± 432 and 1,734 g/d (745 to 2,482 g/d). Predicted prepartum supply of MP averaged 822 ± 157 in nulliparous cows, ranging from 517 to 1,094 g/d, and 1,146 ± 316 in parous cows, ranging from 463 to 1,733 g/d. Increasing prepartum CP content or predicted supply of MP improved postpartum dry matter intake in nulliparous cows, but increasing prepartum CP content reduced prepartum dry matter intake in parous cows. Yields of milk and fat-corrected milk increased with increasing prepartum supply of MP in nulliparous but not in parous cows. Yields of fat and protein increased in nulliparous cows with increased CP content or supply of MP. Alternatively, in parous cows, yield of milk fat was not influenced by supply of MP but responded quadratically to dietary CP content and was maximized at approximately 14\% CP. Dietary CP had no effect on protein yield in parous cows, but increasing the supply of MP improved protein yield only in cows from experiments with {\textgreater}36 kg/d of milk production, whereas MP supply had no effect on protein yield of parous cows from experiments with {\textless}28 kg/d of milk production. Performance of dairy cows was responsive to prepartum supply of MP and nulliparous benefited from diets with increased MP intake. Based on current results, production responses for nulliparous cows increased linearly up to the maximum MP intake of 1,100 g/d observed in the study, whereas for parous cows, only yield of milk protein in cows producing more than 36 kg of milk/d was influenced by supplying more than 800 g/d of MP.},

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, with advanced age being one of the major predictors of poor prognosis. To replicate the mechanisms and multifaceted complexities of human TBI and develop prospective therapeutic treatments, various TBI animal models have been developed. These models have been essential in furthering our understanding of the pathophysiology and biochemical effects on brain mechanisms following TBI. Despite these advances, translating preclinical results to clinical application, particularly in elderly individuals, continues to be challenging. This review aims to provide a clinical perspective, identifying relevant variables currently not replicated in TBI animal models, to potentially improve translation to clinical practice, especially as it applies to elderly populations. As background for this clinical perspective, we reviewed articles indexed on PubMed from 1970 to 2019 that used aged animal models for studying TBI. These studies examined end points relevant for clinical translation, such as neurocognitive effects, sensorimotor behavior, physiological mechanisms, and efficacy of neuroprotective therapies. However, compared with the higher incidence of TBI in older individuals, animal studies on the basic science of aging and TBI remain remarkably scarce. Moreover, a fundamental disconnect remains between experiments in animal models of TBI and successful translation of findings for treating the older TBI population. In this article, we aim to provide a clinical perspective on the unique attributes of TBI in older individuals and a critical appraisal of the research to date on TBI in aged animal models as well as recommendations for future studies.},

In reptiles, Chlamydia can cause hepatitis, pneumonitis, and conjunctivitis and it can cause high mortality in young animals. The objectives of this study were to estimate the pooled prevalence of chlamydial infections in reptiles and to assess the trend of these infections over time. Materials and Methods: The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Relevant studies were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The retrieved studies were screened for eligibility. Then, important data were extracted from the included studies. A random effects model was used for all analyses. Subgroup analysis was used to assess heterogeneity for orders of reptiles, continents where the studies were conducted, and types of specimens. Cumulative meta-analysis and meta-regression were used to determine the trend of the prevalence over time. The quality of each included study was evaluated. Results: Of 106 studies (with a total of 2607 samples), 20 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of chlamydial infections in reptiles was 23.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 15.4-34.0). The trend of chlamydial infections increased from 1990 to 2008; thereafter, it was almost stable at slightly over 20\%. The most commonly reported Chlamydia spp. were Chlamydia psittaci, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia pecorum, and Chlamydia caviae. Among reptiles, the prevalence of chlamydial infections was highest in crocodiles (57.3\% [95\% CI: 32.5-78.9]). Among continents, the prevalence of chlamydial infections was highest in Australia (68.6\% [95\% CI: 36.8-89.1]). Conclusions: Based on the included studies, the prevalence of chlamydial infections in reptiles was high, especially in crocodiles. Because C. psittaci and C. pneumoniae are commonly found in reptiles and are well-known zoonotic pathogens, they should be of concern for human health.},

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature examining associations between the microbiome and malaria in mammalian hosts. An electronic search algorithm was adapted to PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science, and reference lists of relevant sources were manually searched. Identified studies were screened and assessed independently by 2 authors, and results were compiled in a qualitative synthesis of the evidence. RESULTS: Ten relevant studies were identified. They demonstrate associations between certain intestinal communities and protection against Plasmodium infection and modulation of disease severity. Plasmodium infection acutely and reversibly reshapes gut microbial composition in mice. The makeup of human skin microbial communities may influence mosquito attraction and thus disease transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Early research supports a relationship between malaria and the microbiome. The evidence is incomplete, but the observed associations are evocative and signal a promising avenue of inquiry. Microbiome-based studies of malaria can be readily integrated into field-based research.},

	abstract = {Pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) is caused by an age-related degenerative disease of dopaminergic neurones. Despite its importance in equine practice, available information regarding its epidemiology is limited. This systematic review aimed to assess published literature to evaluate available evidence regarding the clinical presentation, prevalence and risk factors for PPID in horses and ponies. Electronic database searches were undertaken using a range of terms, and English language publications published prior to August 2016 were included. Both authors independently reviewed screened papers for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the quality of reporting using predefined criteria. Data were extracted using modified critically appraised topic data collection forms. Meta-analysis was not undertaken due to marked between-study variations. Following removal of duplicate records, of 358 published papers yielded by the search, 97 abstracts were screened for eligibility and 29 publications meeting inclusion criteria were included in the review. Most studies reviewed were case series or cross-sectional studies, with considerable variation in study populations and PPID case definition. Hypertrichosis and/or other hair coat abnormalities, laminitis and epaxial muscle wastage or muscle atrophy are the most frequently reported clinical signs, with prevalence of these signs increasing with increasing horse age. The most robust prevalence estimates for PPID were 21.2\% in horses and ponies aged ≥15 years and 2.9\% amongst the general equine population. Findings regarding breed and sex predispositions were equivocal and only increasing age has been identified as a significant risk factor for PPID.},

	abstract = {Rodents carry many ectoparasites, such as ticks, lice, fleas, and mites, which have potential public health importance. Middle Eastern countries are hotspots for many emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as plague, leishmaniasis, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Q fever, due to their ecological, socioeconomic, and political diversity. Rodent ectoparasites can act as vectors for many of these pathogens. Knowledge of rodent ectoparasites is of prime importance in controlling rodent ectoparasite-borne zoonotic diseases in this region. The current systematic review and meta-analysis performs a comprehensive synthesis of the available knowledge, providing an evidence-based overview of the ectoparasites detected on rodents in Middle Eastern countries. Following a systematic search in Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science, a total of 113 published articles on rodent ectoparasites were studied and analyzed. A total of 87 rodent species were documented, from which Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, and Rattus rattus were found to be the most common. Fleas were the most reported ectoparasites (87 articles), followed by mites (53), ticks (44), and lice (25). Xenopsylla cheopis, Polyplax spinulosa, Ornithonyssus bacoti, and Hyalomma rhipicephaloides were the most commonly described fleas, lice, mites, and ticks, respectively. Based on the reviewed articles, the median flea, louse, mite, and tick indices were highest in Israel (4.15), Egypt (1.39), Egypt (1.27), and Saudi Arabia (1.17), respectively. Quantitative meta-analysis, using a random-effects model, determined the overall pooled flea prevalence in the Middle East as 40\% (95\% CI: 25-55, I(2) = 100\%, p {\textless} 0.00001), ranging between 13\% (95\% CI: 0-30, I(2) = 95\%, p {\textless} 0.00001) in Iran and 59\% (95\% CI: 42-77, I(2) = 75\%, p {\textless} 0.00001) in Israel. The overall pooled louse prevalence was found to be 30\% (95\% CI: 13-47, I(2) = 100\%, p {\textless} 0.00001), ranging between 25\% in Iran (95\% CI: 1-50, I(2) = 99\%) and 38\% in Egypt (95\% CI: 7-68, I(2) = 100\%). In the case of mites, the pooled prevalence in this region was 33\% (95\% CI: 11-55, I(2) = 100\%, p {\textless} 0.00001), where the country-specific prevalence estimates were 30\% in Iran (95\% CI: 4-56, I(2) = 99\%) and 32\% in Egypt (95\% CI: 0-76, I(2) = 100\%). For ticks, the overall prevalence was found to be 25\% (95\% CI: 2-47, I(2) = 100\%, p {\textless} 0.00001), ranging from 16\% in Iran (95\% CI: 7-25, I(2) = 74\%) to 42\% in Egypt (95\% CI: 1-85, I(2) = 100\%). The control of rodent ectoparasites should be considered to reduce their adverse effects. Using the One Health strategy, rodent control, and precisely control of the most common rodent species, i.e., Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, and Rattus rattus, should be considered to control the rodent-borne ectoparasites in this region.},

The current systematic review aimed to provide baseline data on rodent helminths to recognize the threats of helminth parasites on public health in the Middle East region. Following a systematic search on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, a total of 65 research studies on rodent cestodes, nematodes, and trematodes, which were conducted in the countries of the Middle East, were analyzed. The study identified 44 rodent species from which Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, and Rattus rattus were most common (63\%) and recognized as the primary rodent hosts for helminth infestation in this region. Cestodes were the most frequently reported (n = 50), followed by nematodes (49), and trematodes (14). The random effect meta-analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of cestode (57.66\%, 95\%CI: 34.63-80.70, l(2)\% = 85.6, p {\textless} 0.001) was higher in Saudi Arabia, followed by nematode (56.24\%, 95\%CI: 11.40-101.1, l(2)\% = 96.7, p {\textless} 0.001) in Turkey, and trematode (15.83\%, 95\%CI: 6.25-25.1, l(2)\% = 98.5, p {\textless} 0.001) in Egypt. According to the overall prevalence estimates of individual studies, nematodes were higher (32.71\%, 95\%CI: 24.89-40.54, l(2)\% = 98.6, p {\textless} 0.001) followed by cestodes (24.88\%, 95\%CI: 19.99-29.77, l(2)\% = 94.9, p {\textless} 0.001) and trematodes (10.17\%, 95\%CI: 6.7-13.65, l(2)\% = 98.3, p {\textless} 0.001) in the rodents of the Middle East countries. The review detected 22 species of helminths, which have zoonotic importance. The most frequent helminths were Capillaria hepatica, Hymenolepis diminuta, Hymenolepis nana, and Cysticercus fasciolaris. There was no report of rodent-helminths from Bahrain, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Furthermore, there is an information gap on rodent helminths at the humans-animal interface level in Middle East countries. Through the One Health approach and countrywide detailed studies on rodent-related helminths along with their impact on public health, the rodent control program should be conducted in this region.},

	abstract = {Rodents are one of the most diversified terrestrial mammals, and they perform several beneficial activities in nature. These animals are also important as carriers of many pathogens with public health importance. The current systematic review was conducted to formulate a true depiction of rodent-related zoonoses in Qatar. Following systematic searches on PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science and a screening process, a total of 94 published articles were selected and studied. The studied articles reported 23 rodent-related zoonotic pathogens that include nine bacterial, eleven parasitic, and three viral pathogens, from which the frequently reported pathogens were Mycobacterium tuberculosis (32 reports), Escherichia coli (23), and Salmonella spp. (16). The possible pathway of entry of the rodent-borne pathogens can be the land port, seaports, and airport of Qatar through carrier humans and animals, contaminated food, and agricultural products. The pathogens can be conserved internally by rodents, pets, and livestock; by agricultural production systems; and by food marketing chains. The overall estimated pooled prevalence of the pathogens among the human population was 4.27\% (95\%CI: 4.03-4.51\%; p {\textless} 0.001) with significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 99.50\%). The top three highest prevalent pathogens were M. tuberculosis (30.90\%; 22.75-39.04\%; p {\textless} 0.001; I(2) = 99.70\%) followed by Toxoplasma gondii (21.93\%; 6.23-37.61\%; p {\textless} 0.001; I(2) = 99.30\%) and hepatitis E virus (18.29\%; 11.72-24.86\%; p {\textless} 0.001; I(2) = 96.70\%). However, there is a knowledge gap about the listed pathogens regarding the occurrence, transmission pathways, and rodent role in transmission dynamics at the human-animal-environment interface in Qatar.

However, the neuroprotective efficacy of palm oil or its tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) from the pre-clinical cell and animal studies have not been systematically reviewed. METHODS: The protocol for this systematic review was registered in "PROSPERO" (CRD42019150408). This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) descriptors of PubMed with Boolean operators were used to construct keywords, including ("Palm Oil"[Mesh]) AND "Nervous System"[Mesh], ("Palm Oil"[Mesh]) AND "Neurodegenerative Diseases"[Mesh], ("Palm Oil"[Mesh]) AND "Brain"[Mesh], and ("Palm Oil"[Mesh]) AND "Cognition"[Mesh], to retrieve the pertinent records from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and ScienceDirect from 1990 to 2019, while bibliographies, ProQuest and Google Scholar were searched to ensure a comprehensive identification of relevant articles. Two independent investigators were involved at every stage of the systematic review, while discrepancies were resolved through discussion with a third investigator. RESULTS: All of the 18 included studies in this review (10 animal and eight cell studies) showed that palm oil and TRF enhanced the cognitive performance of healthy animals. In diabetes-induced rats, TRF and α-tocotrienol enhanced cognitive function and exerted antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory activities, while in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal model, TRF enhanced the cognitive function and reduced the deposition of β-amyloid by altering the expression of several genes related to AD and neuroprotection. In cell studies, simultaneous treatment with α-tocotrienols and neurotoxins improved the redox status in neuronal cells better than ϒ- and δ-tocotrienols. Both pre-treatment and post-treatment with α-tocotrienol relative to oxidative insults were able to enhance the survival of neuronal cells via increased antioxidant responses. CONCLUSIONS: Palm oil and its TRF enhanced the cognitive functions of healthy animals, while TRF and α-tocotrienol enhanced the cognitive performance with attenuation of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and apoptosis in diabetes-induced or transgenic AD animal models. In cell studies, TRF and α-tocotrienol exerted prophylactic neuroprotective effects, while α-tocotrienol exerted therapeutic neuroprotective effects that were superior to those of ϒ- and δ-tocotrienol isomers.},

	abstract = {Digital dermatitis (DD) is an infectious bacterial disease affecting cattle feet. Footbaths are a common herd-level control method for DD; however, variations in product, concentration, and frequency of use complicate comparisons between protocols. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate all walk-through footbath protocols reported that determined efficacy for prevention and treatment of DD lesions in dairy cattle. An extensive literature search was conducted, including electronic databases and gray literature updated until March 2018. Studies identified included all liquid walk-through footbath protocols that were compared to other footbath protocols or no footbath. Only studies with treatment or prevention of DD lesions as an outcome were included. Literature search and subsequent screening identified 14 publications with 24 treatment comparisons and 24 prevention comparisons. Studies included mostly had low and/or unclear risks of bias. Descriptive analyses were performed according to prevention and treatment outcomes, with case and success definitions summarized as odds ratios (OR). A subsequent network meta-analysis was conducted of 11 studies, comparing 17 protocol comparisons for the prevention outcome and 10 studies comparing 19 protocol comparisons for the treatment outcome, using semi-informative priors in a Bayesian statistical framework. Results of a random effects Bayesian network meta-analysis indicated only 5\% copper sulfate used at least 4 times/wk was superior to both no footbath (OR: 5.26; 95\% CrI: 1.27-28.8) and a water placebo (OR: 9.47; 95\% CrI: 1.03-85.8) in treatment of DD. No other protocol was associated with a reduction in DD, and there were no differences in pair-wise comparisons between any active treatments. Unfortunately, for both outcomes (treatment and prevention), small sample sizes (adjusted for clustering) limited the power to detect substantial differences between protocol effects. Thus, despite widespread use of footbaths, limited strength of evidence for use remains and standardized protocols with large sample sizes are needed to further investigate effectiveness of footbath protocols for control of DD. This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.},

A total of eight relative studies and 194 chicks were analyzed. The Random Effects model and the Fixed Effects model were performed. Using the Random Effects model for amino acids, a Standardized mean difference (SMD) of 2.05 and 1.46 was obtained for alanine and threonine concentrations respectively. This indicates a significant increase in the concentration of these amino acids within the plasma. An SMD of -2.68 and -2.46 was obtained for cysteine and proline concentrations respectively, this indicates a significant decrease in the concentration of these amino acids within the plasma. The pooled estimates regarding the effect of heat stress exposure on plasma amino acid concentrations for proline were -0.013. The SMDs obtained for amino acid concentrations within the brain (diencephalon) including leucine, methionine, valine and isoleucine were 1.799, 0.88, 2.11, 1.85, respectively, This indicates a significant increase in the concentration of these amino acids within the brain (P {\textless} 0.05). Comparing the SMD obtained for long-term heat exposure (two weeks) with the SMD obtained for short-term heat exposure shows that plasma amino acid concentrations including aspartic acid, glutamic acid, leucine, lysine, methionine, valine, isoleucine, tyrosine, glycine, proline, phenylalanine and threonine had all decreased. The relationship between heat exposure and changes in the concentration of some amino acids in the plasma is an important scientific finding.},

Transgenic animal models are commonly used to study the neurobiological mechanisms underlying aggressive phenotypes and have led to new insights into aggression. This systematic review critically evaluates the available literature on transgenic animal models tested for aggression with the resident-intruder test. By combining the available literature on this topic, we sought to highlight effective methods for laboratory aggression testing and provide recommendations for study design as well as aggression induction and measurement in rodents that are translational to humans, taking into consideration possible confounding factors. In addition, we built a molecular landscape of interactions between the proteins encoded by the aggression-linked genes from our systematic search. Some molecular pathways within this landscape overlap with psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders and the landscapes point towards a number of putative (drug) targets for aggression that need to be validated in future studies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively review studies on dog-assisted interventions (DAIs) among older people in residential long-term care facilities (RLTCFs) and to provide an overview of their interventions, outcomes and methodological quality. METHOD: We searched 18 electronic databases to identify English articles (published January 2000-December 2019) reporting on well-defined DAIs targeting older adults (≥65 years) in RLTCF. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers. Descriptive statistics were produced for quantitative studies, with key themes identified among qualitative studies. Where possible, estimates were pooled from randomised controlled trials using random effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: Forty-three relevant studies (39 quantitative; 4 qualitative) were identified. The majority of quantitative studies were assessed as low-quality according to the MMAT criteria (n = 26, 67\%). Almost half of the quantitative studies (n = 18, 46\%) found no significant changes over time or between groups across outcomes measured. The most salient intervention effects included improved social functioning (n = 10), reduced depressive symptoms (n = 6) and loneliness (n = 5). A random-effects meta-analysis revealed a medium effect in favour of DAT on reducing depressive or loneliness symptoms (pooled SMD: 0.66, 95\%CI 0.21-1.11; I(2)  = 50.5; five trials), relative to treatment as usual. However, compared to treatment as usual, no overall effect of DAI on activities of daily living was detected (p = .737). Key themes from qualitative studies included (a) animals as effective transitional objects, (b) the therapeutic value of pets and (c) the significance of the care environment and stakeholders in facilitating DAI. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings of this review indicate that while DAI has value for older people in RLTCF, challenges remain in accurately measuring its impact to provide a stronger evidence-base. Standardisation of DAI service design, delivery and evaluation is required for future research and practice in providing holistic care for older adults.},

	abstract = {Clinical mastitis (CM) is one of the most frequent and costly diseases in dairy cows. A frustrating aspect of CM is its recurrent nature. This review was conducted to synthesize knowledge on risk of repeated cases of CM, effects of recurrent CM cases, and risk factors for CM recurrence. A systematic review methodology was used to identify articles for this narrative review. Searches were performed to identify relevant scientific literature published after 1989 in English or French from 2 databases (PubMed and CAB Abstracts) and 1 search platform (Web of Science). Fifty-seven manuscripts were selected for qualitative synthesis according to the inclusion criteria. Among the 57 manuscripts selected in this review, a description of CM recurrence, its risk factors, and effects were investigated and reported in 33, 37, and 19 selected manuscripts, respectively. Meta-analysis and meta-regression analyses were used to compute risk ratio comparing risk of CM in cows that already had 1 CM event in the current lactation with risk of CM in healthy cows. For these analyses, 9 manuscripts that reported the total number of lactations followed and the number of lactations with ≤1 and ≤2 CM cases were used. When summarizing results from studies requiring ≥5 d between CM events to consider a CM event as a new case, we observed no significant change in CM susceptibility following a first CM case (risk ratio: 0.99; 95\% confidence interval: 0.86-1.14). However, for studies using a more liberal CM recurrence definition (i.e., only 24 h between CM events to consider new CM cases), we observed a 1.54 times greater CM risk (95\% confidence interval: 1.20-1.97) for cows that already had 1 CM event in the current lactation compared with healthy cows. The most important risk factors for CM recurrence were parity (i.e., higher risk in older cows), a higher milk production, pathogen species involved in the preceding case, and whether a bacteriological cure was observed following the preceding case. The most important effects of recurrent CM were the milk yield reduction following a recurrent CM case, which was reported to be similar to that of the first CM case, and the increased risk of culling and mortality, which were reported to surpass those of first CM cases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The pathogenic role of mycoplasmas in the lower respiratory tract (LRT) of dogs is debated, because mycoplasmas can be isolated from both healthy and sick dogs. OBJECTIVES: To critically assess available data from controlled observational studies on the role of 4 mycoplasma species in LRT disease of dogs. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analyses. METHODS: Seven electronic databases were searched for relevant publications. Risk of bias was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analyses, stratified by mycoplasmal species, were performed using a random effects Bayesian model with noninformative priors to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between Mycoplasma cynos, Mycoplasma canis, Mycoplasma spumans, and Mycoplasma edwardii and LRT disease in dogs. RESULTS: Five studies were included from 1201 references identified. All studies dealt with M. cynos, whereas 3 dealt with the other mycoplasma species. A significant association was found between M. cynos and LRT disease (Bayesian OR, 3.60; CI, 1.31-10.29). Conversely, M. canis, M. spumans, and M. edwardii were not significantly associated with LRT signs (Bayesian OR, 1.06; CI, 0.10-14.63; Bayesian OR, 3.40; CI, 0.16-54.27; and Bayesian OR, 1.04; CI, 0.05-23.54, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Results support a pathogenic role of M. cynos and a commensal role of M. canis and M. edwardii in LRT in dogs. Although the association was not significant based on the CI, the point estimate of the Bayesian OR was relatively high for M. spumans, making its role less clear. Mycoplasma cynos-specific polymerase chain reaction should be considered on samples from dogs with LRT.},

The objective of this paper was to review the clinical effectiveness of bee venom and adverse events induced by bee venom, regardless of the disease. Four electronic databases were searched in April 2020. The reference lists of the retrieved articles and previous review articles were also hand-searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using any type of bee venom other than live bee stings for the clinical treatment of any disease other than cancer were included. The studies were selected, the data were extracted, and the quality of the studies was assessed by two authors. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias standards. Twelve RCTs were included in this review-three on Parkinson's disease, four on arthralgia, four on musculoskeletal disorders, and one on polycystic ovary syndrome. The types of bee venom used were acupuncture injections, ultrasound gel, and an ointment. Six studies reported adverse events, and skin reactions such as pruritus and swelling were the most common. The large-scale clinical trials of bee venom therapy are needed to verify the statistical difference, and the reporting system for adverse events is also required to increase the safety of bee venom therapy.},

	abstract = {Protein degradation during ensiling is a major problem. Tannins are known to prevent or decelerate protein degradation in the rumen and may be able to do so in silages as well. Therefore, the present evaluation aimed to analyse the influence of tannins on silage quality. This was done by integrating from all suitable experiments found in literature on the topic in a meta-analysis approach. A total of 122 datasets originating from 28 experiments obtained from 16 published articles and one own unpublished experiment were included in the database. Tannins in the silages originated either from the plants ensiled or from supplementations of tanniferous plants or tannins extracted from such plants. Tannin concentrations ranged from 0 to 57.8 g/kg dry matter, and the ensiling period varied from 30 to 130 days. The analysis was based on the linear mixed model methodology in which the different studies were considered as random effects and tannin-related properties (either concentration or type of tannins) were treated as fixed effects. Results revealed that greater concentrations of tannins were associated with a decrease of butyrate concentration in the silages (p {\textless} 0.05). An increasing tannin concentration was also accompanied with smaller proportions of soluble N, free amino acid N, non-protein nitrogen and NH(3) -N in total silage N (p {\textless} 0.05). The relationships between hydrolysable and condensed tannins and the decline in butyrate and NH(3) -N concentrations in the silages were of different magnitude (p {\textless} 0.05). A higher tannin concentration was associated with a decline in in vitro dry matter digestibility. It was concluded that tannins apparently have the ability to limit extensive proteolysis which may occur during ensiling and thus may improve the fermentative quality of silages. A desired side effect seems to be given by the tannins' apparent property to limit the activity of the butyrate-producing microbes.},

	abstract = {The immunogenicity and efficacy of Fasciola DNA vaccines have not yet been comprehensively summarised in the form of a systematic review and meta-analysis. Though multiple vaccine studies with respect to Fasciola vaccines exist, the variance in the experimental parameters has made comparison difficult. We conducted a bibliographic database search in Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Web of Science databases, limited to publications from 1998 to 2017. The key words: Liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica, Fasciola gigantica, DNA vaccination, and immunogenicity were used in combination to form search strings. A total of 4760 studies were identified after initial screening, of which 14 qualified for systematic review and 7 for meta-analysis. The mean Odds Ratio (OR) for all studies was 0.565 (95\% confidence interval (CI) of 0.293 to 1.087), which means the percentage of protection in terms of decreased fluke burden in animals vaccinated with DNA vaccines was 43.5\%. A moderate protective efficacy was observed for cysteine protease and phosphoglycerate kinase vaccine antigen candidates (pooled OR and 95\% CI, [0.542; 0.179-1.721] and [0.616; 0.219-1.735], respectively). Vaccine effectiveness was observed in individual studies and cohorts; however, the overall pooled efficacy for all vaccine candidates was found to be non-significant. Despite multiple individual studies showing promising results for various DNA vaccine candidates against fascioliasis, the pooled studies showed the non-significant effect of the vaccine formulations against fluke burden, and displayed minimal protective efficacy against Fasciola infection. Though promising results are observed in isolated studies, further animal trials with standardised experimental parameters are required to develop new vaccine candidates effective against Fasciola.},

	abstract = {We aimed to present a comprehensive review of published meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies on the association of fish consumption and the risk of chronic disease. A systematic search was undertaken in Pubmed and Scopus to October 2019 to find meta-analyses of observational studies evaluating the association of fish consumption and the risk of chronic disease. Retrospective and cross-sectional studies and studies with unadjusted risk estimates were excluded. The summary relative risk (SRR) for each meta-analysis was recalculated by using a random-effects model. The methodological quality of included meta-analyses and the quality of the evidence were assessed by the AMSTAR and NutriGrade tools, respectively. A total of 34 meta-analyses of prospective observational studies, reporting SRRs for 40 different outcomes obtained from 298 primary prospective cohort studies, were included. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that each 100-g/d increment in fish consumption was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (SRR: 0.92; 95\% CI: 0.87, 0.97), cardiovascular mortality (SRR: 0.75; 95\% CI: 0.65, 0.87), coronary heart disease (SRR: 0.88; 95\% CI: 0.79, 0.99), myocardial infarction (SRR: 0.75; 95\% CI: 0.65, 0.93), stroke (SRR: 0.86; 95\% CI: 0.75, 0.99), heart failure (SRR: 0.80; 95\% CI: 0.67, 0.95), depression (SRR: 0.88; 95\% CI: 0.79, 0.98), and liver cancer (SRR: 0.65; 95\% CI: 0.48, 0.87). For cancers of most sites, there was no significant association and the quality of the evidence was rated low and very low. In conclusion, evidence of moderate quality suggests that fish consumption is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, depression, and mortality and, therefore, can be considered as a healthy animal-based dietary source of protein. Further research is needed for outcomes for which the quality of the evidence was rated low and very low, considering types of fish consumed, different methods of cooking fish, and all potential confounding variables.},

We aimed to test the linear and potential non-linear dose-response relationships between fish consumption and risk of all-cause and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, and possible confounding by region. DESIGN: Systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis. SETTING: Systematic search using PubMed and Scopus, from inception up to September 2016. SUBJECTS: Prospective observational studies reporting the estimates of all-cause and CVD mortality in relation to three or more categories of fish intake were included. Random-effects dose-response meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Fourteen prospective cohort studies (ten publications) with 911 348 participants and 75 451 incident deaths were included. A 20 g/d increment in fish consumption was significantly and inversely associated with the risk of CVD mortality (relative risk=0·96; 95 \% CI 0·94, 0·98; I 2=0 \%, n 8) and marginally and inversely associated with the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk=0·98; 95 \% CI 0·97, 1·00; I 2=81·9 \%, n 14). Subgroup analysis resulted in a significant association only in the subgroup of Asian studies, compared with Western studies, in both analyses. Analysis of Western studies suggested a nearly U-shaped association, with a nadir at fish consumption of {\textasciitilde}20 g/d in analysis of both outcomes. Meanwhile, the associations appeared to be linear in Asian studies. CONCLUSIONS: There was potential evidence of regional differences in the association between fish consumption and mortality. It may be helpful to examine the associations by considering types of fish consumed and methods of fish preparation.},

The relative risks for the highest compared with the lowest category of fish consumption were 0.86 (95\% CI 0.76, 0.96; I(2) = 50\%, n = 8) for all-cause mortality, and 0.61 (95\% CI 0.29, 0.93; I(2) = 68\%, n = 3) for CHD. There was a monotonic inverse association, with a nadir at fish consumption of approximately 2-3 servings/week, in both analyses. A nonsignificant inverse association was found for stroke. In the analysis of all-cause mortality, a nonsignificant inverse association was found in studies that controlled for energy intake, suggesting that the observed inverse association was not an addition effect, but may be due to substituting other foods such as red and processed meat with fish.},

We aimed to quantify the association of fish consumption with risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and to clarify the shape of the dose-response relation in Western and Asian countries. A systematic literature review was performed in PubMed and Scopus from inception to January 2018. Prospective observational studies reporting risk estimates of MI for 3 or more quantitative categories of fish intake were included. A random-effects dose-response meta-analysis was conducted. Eleven prospective cohort studies, comprising a total of 398,221 participants and 8468 cases of MI, were analyzed. A significant inverse association was found for the highest compared with the lowest category of fish intake (relative risk: 0.73, 95\% confidence interval: 0.59-0.87; I(2) = 72\%) and for a 15-g/d (105 g/wk, approximately equal to a 1 serving/wk) increment in fish consumption (relative risk: 0.96, 95\% confidence interval: 0.94-0.99; I(2) = 65\%). A subgroup analysis showed a significant inverse association only in the subgroup of Asian studies as compared to Western studies. A nonlinear dose-response analysis suggested a linear decrement in the risk with the increase in fish consumption in the analysis of Asian studies. A modest U-shaped association was observed in the analysis of Western studies. In conclusion, higher fish consumption was associated with a lower risk of MI. However, considering the observed regional difference in this association, further observational studies are needed to provide more detailed explanations about this difference.},

To estimate the risks of virus contamination, knowledge about the quantity of virus and decimal reduction values of the standard preservation method by salting is of great importance. A literature search, based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, was performed in search engine CAB Abstracts to determine the viral load of 14 relevant animal viruses in natural casings or intestines. Only a very limited number of scientific publications per virus were found and viral loads in the intestines varied from high for ASFV (five publications), BVDV (3), CSFV (6), PPRV (3), RPV(2) and TGEV (3) to moderate for PEDV (2) and SVDV (3), low for HEV (2) and FMDV (5), very low for VESV (1) and negative for PrV (2) and VSV (1). PRRSV was found in intestines, however, viral titers were not published. Three viruses (BVDV, CSFV and PPRV) with high viral loads were selected to search for their inactivation kinetics. For casings, no inactivation data were found, however, thermal inactivation data of these viruses were available, but differed in quantity, quality and matrices. In conclusion, important data gaps still exist when it comes to the quantitative inactivation of viruses in sausage casings or livestock intestines.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal diseases are prevalent in dogs, and probiotics could provide safe alternatives to conventional treatments. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effects of probiotics when used in the prevention or treatment of gastrointestinal disease in dogs compared with no treatment, only symptomatic treatment, or conventional treatment. METHODS: A systematic review was preformed searching AGRICOLA, AGRIS, CAB Abstracts, Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, and Web of Science to identify articles published before April 1, 2017. Selection criteria were original research report, those published in peer reviewed journal, and study investigating in vivo use of probiotic for prevention or treatment of gastrointestinal disease in dogs. Studies were rated based on the level of evidence, and methodological quality was evaluated by the following variables: similarities between groups at baseline, risk of bias, and study group size. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five studies were identified, of which 17 met the inclusion criteria-12 concerned acute gastrointestinal disease and 5 concerned chronic gastrointestinal disease. The level of evidence ranged between randomized controlled studies and crossover uncontrolled trials; estimated risk of bias was generally moderate to high; and sample sizes were small. Feces consistency was the most frequently evaluated clinical variable. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The current data point toward a very limited and possibly clinically unimportant effect for prevention or treatment of acute gastrointestinal disease. For chronic gastrointestinal disease, dietary intervention remains the major key in treatment, whereas probiotic supplement seems not to add significant improvement. However, studies were often underpowered, underscoring the need for future larger, preferably multicenter studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent years, animal models of bone infections have been used with increased frequency in order to evaluate novel diagnostic and anti-infective technologies, like antibacterial coating of bone implants or local antibiotic carrier products. Therefore, it is highly relevant to evaluate the scientific quality of existing bone infection models. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of 316 studies of large non-rodent animal models of bone infection (254 rabbit, 16 pig, 23 dog, 11 goat, and 12 sheep) and extracted data on study design, methodological quality, and postmortem evaluation of infection with respect to reporting and quantification of pathology and microbiology. RESULTS: The review demonstrated a substantial lack of study-design information, which hampers reproducibility and continuation of the established work. Furthermore, the methodological study quality was found to be low, as the definition of infection, randomization, power analysis, and blinding were only seldomly reported. The use of histology increased in recent years, but a semi-quantitative scoring of the lesions was often missing, i.e. no objective quantification of outcome. Most of the studies focused on whether the inoculated bacteria were present within the bone tissue post mortem or not. However, very often the bacterial burden was not quantified. In many of the models, different antimicrobial interventions were examined and, although antimicrobial effects were commonly described, a lack of complete sterile outcome was observed in many models. On the basis of the systematic review, we established a study template providing a guideline for the standard reporting of animal models of bone infections, including details related to the animal, pathogen, infected animal, and postmortem analysis that are of crucial importance for validation of results and reproducibility. CONCLUSIONS: As the aim of many bone infection models is to examine the effect of an intervention, the guideline emphasizes the importance of objective quantification of outcome, e.g., blinded quantitative scoring of histological findings and quantification of bacterial burden within tissue and on inserted implants. Less than 5\% of the analyzed studies adhered completely to the ideal form presented in the study template. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Anti-infective interventions must be tested in preclinical animal models before implementation in human patients, and optimal design and validation is essential for a high translational value.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To combine the results of dysregulated lncRNAs in individual renal fibrosis lncRNA expression profiling studies and to identify potential lncRNA biomarkers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically searched three databases to identify lncRNA expression studies of renal fibrosis in animal models and humans. The lncRNA expression data were extracted from 24 included studies, and a lncRNA vote-counting strategy was applied to identify significant lncRNA biomarkers. The lncLocator algorithm was utilized to predict the potential subcellular localization of these lncRNAs. The predicted targets of the identified lncRNA biomarkers were obtained by searching LncBase v.2 and catRAPID. Finally, GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses were performed. KEY FINDINGS: We recognized a significant lncRNA signature of 95 differentially expressed lncRNAs in 731 samples from rodent models of renal fibrosis and CKD patients, among which TCONS\_01181049 and TCONS\_01496394 were commonly upregulated in both urine and renal tissues, while lncRNA-Cancer Susceptibility Candidate 2 was downregulated in both blood and renal tissues. About 73.33\% dysregulated lncRNAs in renal fibrosis animal models and 81.82\% dysregulated lncRNAs in CKD patients were predicted to be localized to the cytoplasm. The most relevant biological processes and molecular functions associated with these lncRNAs were mRNA processing and RNA binding. SIGNIFICANCE: The present systematic review identified 95 significantly dysregulated lncRNAs from 24 studies and future investigations should focus on exploring their potential effects on renal fibrosis and their clinical utility as biomarkers or therapeutic targets.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.arthro.2019.01.018},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: To systematically review the literature regarding the biomechanical properties of various meniscal root repair techniques. METHODS: A systematic review of multiple databases was performed. The inclusion criteria included English language, studies relevant to meniscal root repairs, studies comparing 2 or more different discrete techniques, posterior root repairs, controlled laboratory studies, and human cadaveric or animal studies. Abstracts, case reports, cohort studies, case-control studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and studies of meniscal body repairs were excluded. RESULTS: Seventeen controlled laboratory studies were included for final analysis. There is no consensus on biomechanical superiority between transtibial pullout repair (TPR) and suture anchor repair. For TPR, there is no significant difference between 1 and 2 tibial tunnels. Nonanatomic repairs result in significantly lower joint surface contact areas and higher contact pressures, but suture placement farther from the root results in higher maximum load to failure. Two-suture repair has a greater maximum load to failure than 1-suture repair. Use of more than 2 sutures has diminishing returns. The modified Mason-Allen suture configuration is superior to a simple suture configuration, but there is no consensus regarding the superiority or feasibility of more complex sutures. There is no consensus on the superiority of a single suture material or shape. CONCLUSIONS: Anatomic meniscal root repairs with either TPR or suture anchor repair have better joint surface contact pressures and contact surface areas than nonanatomic repairs. The use of 2 sutures results in better fixation than 1 suture. There is evidence that the modified Mason-Allen suture configuration is superior to a simple suture configuration in a TPR, although the benefits of more complicated configurations are unclear. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study suggests that, in general, more complex sutures exhibit higher maximum loads. Increasing the number of sutures to up to 2 of the same configuration also increases the maximum load.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Liver allograft preservation frequently involves static cold storage (CS) and machine perfusion (MP). With its increasing popularity, we investigated whether MP was superior to CS in terms of beneficial outcomes. METHODS: Human studies and large animal studies that optimized livers for transplantation using MP versus CS were assessed (PubMed/Medline/EMBASE). Meta-analyses were conducted for comparisons. Study quality was assessed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale and SYRCLE's risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included. Among the large animal studies, lower levels of lactate dehydrogenase (SMD -3.16, 95\% CI -5.14 to -1.18), alanine transferase (SMD -2.46, 95\% CI -4.03 to -0.90), and hyaluronic acid (SMD -2.48, 95\% CI -4.21 to -0.74) were observed in SNMP-preserved compared to CS-preserved livers. NMP-preserved livers showing lower level of hyaluronic acid (SMD -3.97, 95\% CI -5.46 to -2.47) compared to CS-preserved livers. Biliary complications (RR 0.45, 95\% CI 0.28 to 0.73) and early graft dysfunction (RR 0.56, 95\% CI 0.34 to 0.92) also significantly reduced with HMP preservation in human studies. No evidence of publication bias was found. CONCLUSIONS: MP preservation could improve short-term outcomes after transplantation compared to CS preservation. Additional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to develop clinical applications of MP preservation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The number of periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is increasing annually. Animal models have been used to clarify their clinical characteristics and the infection mechanism of pathogenic bacteria, However, since the prosthesis design of animal models is not uniform, it is difficult to simulate the environment of clinical PJI. OBJECTIVES: To retrospect the progress on the prosthesis design of animal models of PJI after TKA and to summarize the criteria for evaluating a clinically representative model of PJI. METHODS: This systematic review was reported on the basis of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA). Pubmed, EMbase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Wanfang Data and China National Knowledge Infrastructure were researched for animal models of PJI after TKA from database establishment to April 2019 according to Chinese and English retrieval words, including "periprosthetic joint infections and total knee arthroplasty," "periprosthetic joint infections and model," "periprosthetic joint infections and biofilm," and "total knee arthroplasty and model." RESULTS: A total of 12 quantitative studies were enrolled in our study finally: 8 representative studies described prosthesis designs used in PJI animal models, 4 studies described prosthesis designs in non-infected animal models which were suitable for infection models. The major problems need to be dealed with were prosthesis, installation location, material, the function of separating the articular and medullary cavity, fixation manner, and the procedure of preserving the posterior cruciate ligament. CONCLUSION: A highly representative design of the animal prosthesis of PJI should meet the following criteria: the surface of the prosthesis is smooth with the formation of biofilm, composed of titanium-6Al-4V or cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloy; prosthesis can bear weight and is highly stable; and it can connect the joint cavity and medullary cavity simultaneously. To reach a more reliable conclusion, further experiments and improvements are required.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a thermogenic tissue with potential as a therapeutic target in the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders. The most used technique for quantifying human BAT activity is the measurement of (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake via a positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan following exposure to cold. However, several studies have indicated the measurement of the supraclavicular skin temperature (SST) by infrared thermography (IRT) to be a less invasive alternative. This work reviews the state of the art of this latter method as a means of determining BAT activity in humans. METHODS: The data sources for this review were PubMed, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost (SPORTdiscus), and eligible studies were those conducted in humans. RESULTS: In most studies in which participants were first cooled, an increase in IRT-measured SST was noted. However, only 5 of 24 such studies also involved a nuclear technique that confirmed increased activity in BAT, and only 2 took into account the thickness of the fat layer when measuring SST by IRT. CONCLUSIONS: More work is needed to understand the involvement of tissues other than BAT in determining IRT-measured SST; at present, IRT cannot determine whether any increase in SST is due to increased BAT activity.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of wheat allergy has reached significant levels in many countries. Therefore, wheat is a major global food safety and public health issue. Animal models serve as critical tools to advance the understanding of the mechanisms of wheat allergenicity to develop preventive and control methods. A comprehensive review on the molecular mechanisms of wheat allergenicity using animal models is unavailable at present. There were two major objectives of this study: To identify the lessons that animal models have taught us regarding the molecular mechanisms of wheat allergenicity and to identify the strengths, challenges, and future prospects of animal models in basic and applied wheat allergy research. Using the PubMed and Google Scholar databases, we retrieved and critically analyzed the relevant articles and excluded celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Our analysis shows that animal models can provide insight into the IgE epitope structure of wheat allergens, effects of detergents and other chemicals on wheat allergenicity, and the role of genetics, microbiome, and food processing in wheat allergy. Although animal models have inherent limitations, they are critical to advance knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of wheat allergenicity. They can also serve as highly useful pre-clinical testing tools to develop safer genetically modified wheat, hypoallergenic wheat products, novel pharmaceuticals, and vaccines.},

METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, and Chinese Sinomed databases were searched systematically from their initiation date to October 5, 2018. Two researchers independently screened the literatures, which used the bone mineral density (BMD), total bone volume by total tissue volume (BV/TV) (\%), and trabecular thickness/spacing (Tb/Sp) as the outcome measures. RESULTS: Five eligible studies were selected. In the BMSC treatment groups, the BMD values and normalized BV/TV values remarkably increased. In addition, in the BMSCs plus other treatment groups, the BMD and Tb/Sp values significantly increased. CONCLUSION: This study showed that BMSCs could accelerate callus maturity, ossification and restore mechanical properties of bones in osteoporotic fractures.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This article systematically reviews the current evidence regarding inflammation in Tendinopathy with the aim to increase understanding of a potential common pathophysiology. METHODS: Following the PRISMA statements, the terms: (tendinopathy OR (tendons AND rupture)) AND (inflammation OR (inflammation AND cells) OR immune system OR inflammation mediators OR bacteria) were used. One thousand four hundred thirty-one articles were identified which was screened down to 53. RESULTS: 39/53 studies mentioned inflammatory cells but had contradicting conclusions. Macrophages were the most common cell type and inflammatory markers were detectable in all the articles which measure them. CONCLUSIONS: The included studies show different conclusions, but this heterogeneity is not unexpected since the clinical criteria of 'tendinopathy' encompass a huge clinical spectrum. Different 'tendinopathy' conditions may have different pathophysiology, and even the same clinical condition may be at different disease stages during sampling, which can alter the histological and biochemical picture. Control specimen sampling was suboptimal since the healthy areas of the pathological-tendon may actually be sub-clinically diseased, as could the contralateral tendon in the same subject. Detection of inflammatory cells is most sensitive using immunohistochemistry targeting the cluster of differentiation markers, especially when compared to the conventional haematoxylin and eosin staining methods. The identified inflammatory cell types favour a chronic inflammatory process; which suggests a persistent stimulus. This means NSAID and glucocorticoids may be useful since they suppress inflammation, but it is noted that they may hinder tendon healing and cause long term problems. This systematic review demonstrates a diversity of data and conclusions in regard to inflammation as part of the pathogenesis of Tendinopathy, ranging from ongoing or chronic inflammation to non-inflammatory degeneration and chronic infection. Whilst various inflammatory markers are present in two thirds of the reviewed articles, the heterogenicity of data and lack of comparable studies means we cannot conclude a common pathophysiology from this systematic review.},

These animals were chosen due to their origin of existence (Neo-tropics) and over time these animals became domesticated and were distributed throughout the world. Over eighty (80) references were collected for this review and the papers spanned over eighty (80) years from 1934 to 2018. The gastrointestinal parasites reported for each animal were tabulated and their effects in the animal noted. Parasites reported in domesticated Neo-tropical animals had little to no effect on wild and free ranging animals with a few cases of illness and decreased productivity. The majority of articles viewed these animals as reservoir host which can infect humans and other domesticated livestock. It must also be noted that research done in the past did not focus on the effect these parasites had on these animals but only observed their potential as reservoirs for parasitic diseases.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0210761},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: As interest in Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAI) grows, there is increasing need to differentiate informal activities from formal and professionally directed therapies, including mental health focussed Canine-Assisted Psychotherapy (CAP). There have been no reviews focusing exclusively on CAP and the distinct developmental period of adolescence. The aims of this study were to identify the characteristics of CAP interventions, their impacts and their acceptability, tolerability and feasibility for adolescents with mental health disorders. METHOD: A systematic review identified studies incorporating canines into mental health treatments for adolescents aged 10-19 years. Studies reporting qualitative or quantitative psychological or psychosocial outcomes were included. RESULTS: Seven studies were scrutinised. Intervention characteristics varied, including a range of formats, settings, locations, doses, and facilitators. Information on the role of the canines in sessions was sparse. CAP had a positive impact on primary diagnoses and symptomatology, conferring additional benefits to standard treatments for internalising disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and equivalent effects for anxiety, anger and externalising disorders. CAP was associated with positive impacts on secondary factors including increased engagement and socialisation behaviours, and reductions in disruptive behaviours within treatment sessions. Global functioning also improved. There was insufficient evidence that CAP improved factors associated with self-esteem, subjective wellbeing, or coping. Good attendance and retention rates indicated high levels of acceptability. Moderate to high tolerability was also indicated. Feasibility may be limited by additional training and logistical requirements. RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the development of theoretically informed, standardised (manualised) intervention protocols that may subsequently form the basis of efficacy and effectiveness testing. Such protocols should clearly describe canine-participant-facilitator interactions via a formalised nomenclature; spontaneous (animal-led), adjunctive (facilitator-led), and experiential (participant-led). CONCLUSIONS: There is emerging evidence to suggest that CAP improves the efficacy of mental health treatments in self-selected adolescent populations via reductions in primary symptomatology, and via secondary factors that improve therapeutic processes and quality, such as engagement and retention.},

	abstract = {While the academic literature widely asserts that production diseases have a significant financial impact on poultry production, these claims are rarely supported by empirical evidence. There is a risk, therefore, that the information needs of poultry producers regarding the costs associated with particular diseases are not being adequately met. A systematic literature review of poultry production diseases was undertaken, first, to scope the availability of studies that estimate the financial impacts of production diseases on poultry systems and, second, on the basis of these studies, estimates were generated of the magnitude of these impacts. Nine production diseases, selected by a panel of stakeholders as being economically important in the EU, were examined. The review found that the poultry disease literature has primarily an epidemiological focus, with very few publications providing estimates of the financial impacts of diseases. However, some publications have quantified the physical impacts of production diseases and control interventions, for example, using measures such as output volumes, mortality rates and bacterial counts. Using these data in standard financial models, partial financial analyses were possible for some poultry production diseases. Coccidiosis and clostridiosis were found to be the most common production diseases in broiler flocks, with salpingoperitonitis being the most common in layers. While the financial impact of untreated diseases varied, most uncontrolled diseases were estimated to make flocks loss-making. However, in all cases, interventions were available that significantly reduced these losses. The review reinforces the concern that the available academic literature is not providing sufficient information for poultry producers to decide on financially optimal disease-prevention and treatment measures.},

This study systematically reviewed available measures to prevent the spread of ASF in the EU domestic pig sector distinguishing between commercial, non-commercial, and outdoor farms. The search was performed in PubMed and using a common browser. A total of 52 documents were selected for the final review process, which included scientific articles, reports, EU documents and official recommendations, among others. From this literature review, 37 measures were identified as preventive measures for the introduction and spread of ASF. Subsequently, these measures were assessed by ASF experts for their relevance in the mitigation of ASF spread on the three mentioned types of farms. All experts agreed that some of the important preventive measures for all three types of farms were: the identification of animals and farm records; strict enforcement of the ban on swill feeding; and containment of pigs, so as to not allow direct or indirect pig-pig and/or pig-wild boar contacts. Other important preventive measures for all farms were education of farmers, workers, and operators; no contact between farmers and farm staff and external pigs; appropriate removal of carcasses, slaughter residues, and food waste; proper disposal of manure and dead animals, and abstaining from hunting activities during the previous 48 h (allowing a 48 h interval between hunting and being in contact with domestic pigs). Finally, all experts identified that the important preventive measures for non-commercial and outdoor farms is to improve access of those farms to veterinarians and health services.},

Bacteria that colonize the gastrointestinal tract depend on minerals to maintain their activities; thus, recent evidence suggests that biofortified foods can modulate the host's beneficial bacterial taxa. The current review analyzed the research data that linked between iron and zinc biofortified foods and gut microbiota modulation. The data analysis was based on the PRISMA guidelines and the data search was performed at PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Scopus databases for experimental studies published from January 2010 until December 2020. The five selected studies were conducted in an experimental in vivo model (Gallus gallus). The identified and discussed research showed positive effects of biofortified foods on the composition and function of the gut microbiota. Further, an increase in short chain fatty acids producing bacterial populations as Lactobacillus and Ruminococcus, and a decrease in potentially pathogenic bacteria as Streptococcus, Escherichia, and Enterobacter was identified due to the consumption of biofortified foods. In conclusion, biofortified foods may contribute to improved gut health without increasing the colonization of pathogenic bacteria. The dietary inclusion of approximately 50\% of iron/zinc biofortified foods has a significant beneficial effect on the gut microbiota. Additional studies in humans and animal models are warranted to further establish the suggested effects on the intestinal microbiome. PROSPERO (CRD42020184221).},

This is mainly caused by the adult human heart lacking the ability to regenerate upon injury, whereas zebrafish have the capacity through cardiomyocyte proliferation to fully regenerate the heart following injury such as apex resection (AR). But a systematic overview of the methods used to evidence heart regrowth and regeneration in the zebrafish is lacking. Herein, we conducted a systematical search in Embase and Pubmed for studies on heart regeneration in the zebrafish following injury and identified 47 AR studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Overall, three different methods were used to assess heart regeneration in zebrafish AR hearts. 45 out of 47 studies performed qualitative (37) and quantitative (8) histology, whereas immunohistochemistry for various cell cycle markers combined with cardiomyocyte specific proteins was used in 34 out of 47 studies to determine cardiomyocyte proliferation qualitatively (6 studies) or quantitatively (28 studies). For both methods, analysis was based on selected heart sections and not the whole heart, which may bias interpretations. Likewise, interstudy comparison of reported cardiomyocyte proliferation indexes seems complicated by distinct study designs and reporting manners. Finally, six studies performed functional analysis to determine heart function, a hallmark of human heart injury after MI. In conclusion, our data implies that future studies should consider more quantitative methods eventually taking the 3D of the zebrafish heart into consideration when evidencing myocardial regrowth after AR. Furthermore, standardized guidelines for reporting cardiomyocyte proliferation and sham surgery details may be considered to enable inter study comparisons and robustly determine the effect of given genes on the process of heart regeneration.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is a serious public health burden in sub-Saharan Africa. Praziquantel is the only drug recommended by the World Health Organization to treat both urogenital and intestinal schistosomiasis. The reliance on a single drug to treat a disease with such a huge burden has raised concerns of possible drug resistance mainly in endemic areas. This systematic review was conducted to identify gaps and recent progress on the efficacy of different regimens of praziquantel in treating schistosomiasis among children in sub-Saharan Africa where Schistosoma mansoni and S. haematobium are endemic. MAIN TEXT: A literature search of peer-reviewed journals was done on Google Scholar, MEDLINE (under EBSCOhost) and PubMed databases using pre-defined search terms and Boolean operators. The search included studies published from 2008 to 2017 (August) with emphasis on the efficacy of praziquantel on S. haematobium and S. mansoni infections among preschool and school children. Nineteen publications satisfied the inclusion criteria for the review. The studies reviewed were from 10 sub-Saharan African countries and 7/19 of the studies (37\%) were conducted in Uganda. Seven studies (37\%) focused on Schistosoma mansoni, 6/19 (31.5\%) on S. haematobium and another 6 on mixed infection. A single standard dose of 40 mg/kg body weight was the most used regimen (9) followed by the repeated single standard dose assessed for efficacy at 3-4 weeks post-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A repeated standard dose of 40 mg/kg achieved satisfactory efficacy compared to a single dose against both parasite species. However, findings on efficacy of repeated doses in co-infection of S. mansoni and S. haematobium were not conclusive. Praziquantel administrated at 60 mg/kg was slightly more efficacious than the 40 mg/kg standard dose. Minor and transitory side-effects were reported for both regimens. The review indicates that further investigations are necessary to conclusively determine efficacy of praziquantel on coinfection of S. haematobium and S. mansoni to formulate concrete guidelines on the use of repeated doses at 40 or 60 mg/kg for treating schistosomiasis. We recommend the use of the egg reduction rate (ERR) formula recommended by the WHO for assessing praziquantel efficacy in order for the results to be comparable for different regions.},

Such medications may influence orthodontic tooth movement biochemical pathways; however, the information originating from human studies is limited. OBJECTIVES: To systematically investigate current evidence from animal experiments on the effect of administering analgesics for a few days, which is consistent with usual clinical practice, on the speed of orthodontic tooth movement. SEARCH METHODS: Eight databases were searched without restrictions, and hand searching was conducted until June 2019. SELECTION CRITERIA: Animal controlled studies assessing the short-term impact of analgesics that can be consumed for orthodontic pain on the speed of orthodontic tooth movement. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Subsequent to retrieving relevant studies and information extraction, the SYRCLE's Risk of Bias Tool was used for risk of bias assessment. RESULTS: Finally, seven studies were selected, and most of them were assessed at unclear risk of bias. Short-term administration of acetaminophen did not affect significantly the speed of tooth movement, while ibuprofen and indomethacin were reported to decrease it. After administering acetylsalicylic acid and celecoxib, the noted effects were inconsistent. The quality of the available evidence for the animal setting was considered as moderate at most. CONCLUSIONS: Consuming specific analgesics for a few days may influence the speed of orthodontic tooth movement in animals. Clinicians should be aware of the relevant implications and be capable to identify those substances that may not interfere with treatment processes.},

	abstract = {Immediately after the removal of orthodontic appliances, the teeth might start to drift away from their corrected position in an attempt to reach a new equilibrium. Medications and biologic factors could potentially modulate these processes. The objective of the present systematic review is to systematically investigate and appraise the quality of the evidence regarding the effect of various medications and biologic factors on the rate of relapse following active tooth movement. Search without restrictions in eight databases and hand searching until April 2020 were conducted. Studies performed on animal models investigating the effects of medication and biologic factors on the rate of relapse following orthodontic tooth movement were considered. Following study retrieval and selection, relevant data were extracted and the risk of bias was assessed. Seventeen studies were finally identified, mostly at either high or unclear risk of bias. Ketorolac did not show any significant effects on relapse, while the administration of tetracycline, atorvastatin, psoralen and raloxifene decreased it. Overall, the same result was observed with bisphosphonates with the exception of low dosage of risedronate, which did not have an effect. Osteoprotegerin and strontium resulted in reduced relapse, but not in the immediate post-administration period. Inconsistent or conflicting effects were noted after the use of simvastatin and relaxin. The quality of the available evidence was considered at best as low. It can be concluded that specific medications and biologic factors may have an effect on the rate of relapse following tooth movement. The orthodontist should be knowledgeable about the substances potentially affecting retention.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The speedy rate of change in the environmental and socio-economics factors may increase the incidence, prevalence and risk of schistosomiasis infections in Zambia. However, available information does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the biogeography and distribution of the disease, ecology and population dynamics of intermediate host snails. The current study used an information-theoretical approach to understand the biogeography and prevalence schistosomiasis and identified knowledge gaps that would be useful to improve policy towards surveillance and eradication of intermediate hosts snails in Zambia. METHODS: To summarise the existing knowledge and build on past and present experiences of schistosomiasis epidemiology for effective disease control in Zambia, a systematic search of literature for the period 2000-2017 was done on PubMed, Google Scholar and EBSCOhost. Using the key words: 'Schistosomiasis', 'Biomphalaria', 'Bulinus', 'Schistosoma mansoni', 'Schistosoma haematobium', and 'Zambia', in combination with Booleans terms 'AND' and 'OR', published reports/papers were obtained and reviewed independently for inclusion. RESULTS: Thirteen papers published in English that fulfilled the inclusion criteria were selected for the final review. The papers suggest that the risk of infection has increased over the years and this has been attributed to environmental, socio-economic and demographic factors. Furthermore, schistosomiasis is endemic in many parts of the country with infection due to Schistosoma haematobium being more prevalent than that due to S. mansoni. This review also found that S. haematobium was linked to genital lesions, thus increasing risks of contracting other diseases such as HIV and cervical cancer. CONCLUSIONS: For both S. haematobium and S. mansoni, environmental, socio-economic, and demographic factors were influential in the transmission and prevalence of the disease and highlight the need for detailed knowledge on ecological modelling and mapping the distribution of the disease and intermediate host snails for effective implementation of control strategies.},

This systematic review describes the prevalence, spatiotemporal distribution, and virus subtypes detected in domestic and wild birds for the past two decades (2000-2019). We collected data from three electronic databases, PubMed, SpringerLink electronic journals and African Journals Online, using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol. A total of 1656 articles were reviewed, from which 68 were selected. An overall prevalence of 3.0\% AIV in birds was observed. The prevalence varied between regions and ranged from 1.1\% to 7.1\%. The Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test showed no significant difference in the prevalence of AIV across regions, χ(2)(3) = 5.237, p = 0.1553 and seasons, T = 820, z = -1.244, p = 0.2136. Nineteen hemagglutinin/neuraminidase subtype combinations were detected during the reviewed period, with southern Africa recording more diverse AIV subtypes than other regions. The most detected subtype was H5N1, followed by H9N2, H5N2, H5N8 and H6N2. Whilst these predominant subtypes were mostly detected in domestic poultry, H1N6, H3N6, H4N6, H4N8, H9N1 and H11N9 were exclusively detected in wild birds. Meanwhile, H5N1, H5N2 and H5N8 were detected in both wild and domestic birds suggesting circulation of these subtypes among wild and domestic birds. Our findings provide critical information on the eco-epidemiology of AIVs that can be used to improve surveillance strategies for the prevention and control of avian influenza in sub-Saharan Africa.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rodent models of liver resection have been used to investigate and evaluate the liver's complex physiology and pathology since 1931. First documented by Higgins and Anderson, such models were created to understand liver regeneration mechanisms to improve outcomes in patients undergoing extensive liver resection for liver cancer or other underlying liver diseases. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted using Pubmed, gathering publications up to January 2019, which engaged with the mouse model of extended liver resection as a method itself. The results of this search were filtered according to their language, novelty, and relevancy. RESULTS: The Boolean search found 3741 articles on Pubmed, with 3130 publications remaining when filtered by language and the presence of a full text. In total, 21 of these publications examined the key themes of the animal model described. The mortality varied from 0 to 50\% depending on the surgeon's experience and the resection method. The liver resection was mainly performed with classic sutures (14 out of 21 publications) and isoflurane was used for anaesthesia (10 out of 21 publications) in combination with analgesics (buprenorphine or ketamine/xylazine). The most used mouse strain was C57BL/6 (7 of 21 publications) which was on average 11 weeks old with a weight of 23 g. CONCLUSION: Through the overview, laid out in the selected publications, this paper reviews the shift of the extended liver resection model from rat to the mouse, describes the state of the art in the experimental setting, and discusses the possible limitations and pitfalls. Clearly, the extended liver resection in mice is a reproducible, practical and easy to learn method.},

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the data to see if this novel method is comparable to traditional laboratory screening and detection methods like Ziehl-Neelsen stain-based assays (ZN) and bacterial culture. The search and data processing strategy is registered at PROSPERO (CRD42019123629). Medline via PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were systematically searched for the keywords "pouched rat" and "tuberculosis". Data from 53,181 samples obtained from 24,600 patients were extracted from seven studies. Using sample-wise detection, the sensitivity of the studies was 86.7\% [95\% CI 80.4-91.2\%], while the specificity was 88.4\% [95\% CI 79.7-93.7\%]. For patient-wise detection, the sensitivity was 81.3\% [95\% CI 64.0-91.4\%], while the specificity was 73.4\% [95\% CI 62.8-81.9\%]. Good and excellent classification was assessed by hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristic analysis for patient-wise and sample-wise detections, respectively. Our study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the above relatively inexpensive and rapid screening method. The results indicate that African giant pouched rats can discriminate healthy controls from TB individuals by sniffing sputum with even a higher accuracy than a single ZN screening.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Fluid resuscitation is the mainstay treatment to reconstitute intravascular volume and maintain end-organ perfusion in patients with severe burns. The use of a hyperosmotic or isoosmotic solution in fluid resuscitation to manage myocardial depression and increased capillary permeability during burn shock has been debated. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the efficacies of hyperosmotic and isoosmotic solutions in restoring hemodynamic stability after burn injuries. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov registry were searched. Randomized control trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of hyperosmotic and isoosmotic fluid resuscitation in patients with burn injuries were selected. Eligible trials were abstracted and assessed for the risk of bias by two reviewers and results of hemodynamic indicators in the included trials were analyzed. RESULTS: Ten trials including 502 participants were published between 1983 and 2013. Compared with isoosmotic group, the hyperosmotic group exhibited a significant decrease in the fluid load (vol/\% total body surface area [TBSA]/weight) at 24 hours postinjury, with a mean difference of -0.54 (95\% confidence interval = -0.92 to -0.17). No differences were observed in the urine output, creatinine level, and mortality at 24 hours postinjury between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperosmotic fluid resuscitation appears to be an attractive choice for severe burns in terms of TBSA or burn depth. Further investigation is recommended before conclusive recommendation.},

	abstract = {Natural waters containing originally hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas with an S2-level at least 1 mg/L are classified as "sulfur waters" or "hydrogen sulfide waters." This systematic review aimed to evaluate in vivo experimental studies investigating the biological effects of natural H2S water drinking in healthy or with disease model laboratory animals. A comprehensive databases search (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) was performed and PICOS criteria were used to assess eligibility. All relevant studies were identified, screened, and examined. The qualitative assessment was performed with the help of the SYRCLE Risk of Bias tool. A total of nine articles were included. The extracted data showed that ad libitum drinking of such waters by rats and mice exert beneficial effects on animal model of diabetes and glucose metabolism plus protective effects on diabetic cardiac, testicular, and nephrological complications as shown biochemically, histopathologically, and bio-molecularly. Additional effects were gastroprotection, antioxidant effects and improvement of intestinal physiology in healthy animals, reduction in general signs of murine model of colitis in mice, improvement in lipid metabolism and lipid-lowering effect, and positive interference with the enterohepatic cycle of the bile acids and biliary functions in hyperlipidemic rats. This systematic review provides preliminary insights into the "biological truth" about natural H2S waters and partly elucidates their potential therapeutic role in balneology and health resort medicine. However, it should be kept in mind that the retrieved preclinical data cannot be directly extrapolated to humans. Additionally, most of the included studies were rated for unclear risk of bias across all categories except random allocation, reflecting very poor reporting of methodological details. These limitations should be addressed when planning similar studies in the future. The question "can traditional hydropinic therapies or drinking cures with H2S waters at natural sulfur water spas/health resorts or natural (even artificial) H2S water consumption at home exert similar effects in humans?" remains to be clarified by clinical trials.},

Vitamin K is known to have several beneficial effects on complications of diabetes and pre-diabetes. However, systematic consolidation of evidence is required to quantify these effects in order to inform clinical practice and research. A systematic search in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, ProQuest, and Google Scholar databases was undertaken from database inception up to October 2018 to evaluate functional roles of different forms of vitamin K on diabetes and pre-diabetes. From 3, 734 identified records, nine articles met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated. Vitamin K supplementation was found to be associated with significant reductions in blood glucose (six studies), increased fasting serum insulin (four studies), reduced hemoglobin A1c (three studies), reduced homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) (two studies), and increased ss-cell function (two studies) in diabetic animal studies. Following 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test, vitamin K supplementation was observed to be effective in reducing blood glucose and insulin levels in the pre-diabetic population. However, no evidence of effect was observed for fasting blood sugar, insulin, HOMA-IR, and homeostatic model assessment-beta-cell function index (two studies). A statistically significant effect was also noted with vitamin K in improving dyslipidemia (three studies) as well as oxidative stress and inflammatory markers (five studies) in diabetic animals. In conclusion, clinical trials and animal studies confirm that vitamin K supplementation may improve both clinical features and complications of diabetes and pre-diabetes. However, quantification of clinical efficacy in the pre-diabetic population and among individuals with comorbidities requires further investigation.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Staphylococcus aureus, in particular its enterotoxigenic strains, is a well-known pathogen in food microbiology as one of the most common causes of food poisoning. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of S. aureus enterotoxigenic strains in Iranian food resources by using a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic search was performed using electronic databases from papers that were published by Iranian authors to the end of July 2017. Then, 34 publications which met our inclusion criteria were selected for data extraction and analysis. RESULTS: The average pooled prevalence of S. aureus in food resources was 15.5\% (95\% CI: 12.7\%-18.9\%) ranging from 1.1\% to 52\%. According to the examined publications the estimated average prevalence of enterotoxigenic strains was estimated at 53.7\% (95\% CI: 41.4\%-65.6\%) ranging from 13\% to 83.3\%. The average prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus in contaminated resources was estimated at 15.5\% (95\% CI: 11.1\%-21.4\%) ranging from 0\% to 32\%. The results showed that SEA and SEG were the most prevalent classic and new staphylococcal enterotoxins' (SEs) types. The results of antibiotic resistance pattern showed the highest resistance rates to β-lactams, tetracycline and erythromycin. CONCLUSIONS: The present analysis showed a significant presence of enterotoxigenic strains of S. aureus and a high rate of staphylococcal enterotoxins among food resources in Iran. However, also the prevalence of MRSA strains is remarkable and requires an improvement of the hygienic conditions to reduce the risk of MRSA dissemination in community and hospitals. Furthermore, the rational use of antibiotics in the environments related to food resources is recommended.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Among the genetic elements, integrons may contribute to the widespread incidence and spreading of antibiotic resistance among Escherichia coli isolates. Accordingly, this review aims to investigate the prevalence of class 1 integron in E. coli isolated from animal sources in Iran. METHODS: This systematic literature search was performed from January 1, 2000 to the end of May 1, 2019.Then, publications that met our inclusion criteria were selected for data extraction and analysis. Also, the quality of included studies was independently assessed by two researchers based on the Joanna Briggs Institute. Meta-analysis was performed by the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software using the random effects model, Cochran's Q, and I (2) tests. Publication bias was estimated by funnel plot and Egger's linear regression test. RESULTS: Based on inclusion criteria, five studies were included to meta-analysis. From those studies, the pooled prevalence of integrons was 33\% (95\% CI, 23.8-43.7\%) ranging from 23.8 to 52.4\%. There was a significant heterogeneity among the 5 studies (χ (2) = 11.73; p {\textless} 0.019; I (2) = 65.91\%). Additionally, Begg's and Egger's tests were performed to quantitatively evaluate the publication biases. According to the results of Begg's test (z = 1.22, p = 0.22) and Egger's test (t = 3.03, p = 0.056), a significant publication bias was not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding revealed the relatively high prevalence of class 1 integrons among E. coli isolates. Moreover, there was a significant heterogeneity among studies and subgroup analysis also showed that there was no difference about prevalence of class 1 integrons among different sample source.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Results regarding the association between fish intake and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) are ambiguous. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate whether there is an association between fish consumption and risk of MetS. DATA SYNTHESIS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted of PubMed, Embase, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar up to August 2019. A random-effects model was used to pool the risk of MetS in the highest category of fish consumption compared with the lowest one. Subgroup analysis was conducted based on country of region, gender, dietary tool, MetS definition, energy adjustment and sample size. A dose-response of analysis of fish intake and risk of MetS was also conducted. Twelve studies with a total of 16 effect sizes (10 cross-sectional and six cohort) were included. An inverse association was observed between fish intake and risk of MetS in cohort (OR = 0.80, 95\% CI: 0.66, 0.96; P = 0.017, I(2) = 62.9\%) but not cross-sectional studies (OR = 0.80, 95\% CI: 0.70, 1.02; P = 0.085, I(2) = 50.1\%). Subgroup analysis suggested that the results were influenced by all the included variables but sample size. A significant non-linear association was observed between fish intake levels and risk of MetS (P-value for non-linearity = 0.010). CONCLUSION: An inverse association existed between fish intake and risk of MetS when combining data from prospective cohort studies. Further studies are needed to confirm such an effect.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Soil transmitted helminth (STH) infections still remain a notable health problem in resource-limited countries due to difficulties in the implementation of control measures. In Nigeria for instance, despite several community-based and provincial reports, national data on prevalence, burdens and risk zones (RZs) for STH infections are lacking. METHODS: The present study employed the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) to determine the prevalence, distribution and RZs for STH infections among Nigerian children through a meta-analysis of data published between 1980 and 2015. Pooled prevalence estimate (PPE) was determined by the random-effects model while heterogeneity was evaluated using the Cochran's Q-test. RESULTS: A total of 18 901 of the 34 518 Nigerian children aged 0-17 years examined across 19 Nigerian states during the period under review were infected with one or more species of STHs. The overall PPE for STH infections was 54.8\% (95\% CI: 54.2-55.3). PPEs for sub-groups ranged between 13.2\% (95\% CI: 11.5-15.1) and 80.9\% (95\% CI: 80.0-81.7). Highest PPEs for STH infections were observed among children within community settings (59.0\%, 95\% CI: 57.7-60.4) and school-aged children (54.9\%, 95\% CI: 54.3-55.5). Ascaris lumbricoides was the most prevalent species (44.6\%, 95\% CI: 44.0-45.2). Over 36\% (15/41) of the studies were published from south-western Nigeria. South-western region was the only high risk zone (HRZ) for STH infections while the rest of the regions were low risk zones (LRZs). CONCLUSIONS: STH infections involving Ascaris lumbricoides, Strongyloides stercoralis, Trichuris trichiura and hookworms are highly prevalent across Nigeria. Strategic use of anthelmintics, health education and adequate sanitation, taking into account this epidemiologic information will help in the control of these infections in Nigeria.},

In the present study, the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guideline was employed to determine the prevalence and geographical distribution of zoonotic helminths in food animals slaughtered in Nigerian abattoirs between 1970 and 2016. Pooled prevalence estimate (PPE) was determined by the random-effects model while heterogeneity was evaluated using the Cochran's Q-test. Results from 42 eligible studies reported across 19 Nigerian states revealed 85,466 cases of zoonotic helminths from 3,771,832 slaughtered food animals. Overall PPE was 2.27\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 2.25, 2.28). PPEs for sub-groups ranged between 0.51\% (95\% CI: 0.46, 0.56) and 18.05\% (95\% CI: 17.12, 19.01) across regions, hosts, study periods and diagnostic methods. Ascaris suum had the highest pooled prevalence of 25.46\% (95\% CI: 24.04, 26.92). Overall prevalence estimates for cestodes, nematodes and trematodes were 0.60\% (95\% CI: 0.59, 0.61), 21.51\% (95\% CI: 20.73, 22.30) and 1.86\% (95\% CI: 1.84, 1.87), respectively. A high degree of heterogeneity 99.97\% (95\% CI: 2.25, 2.28, P: 0.000) was observed. Zoonotic helminths were prevalent in slaughtered food animals, with higher prevalence estimates in the north-central region, pigs and during the last decade reviewed. Ascaris suum was the most prevalent helminth, while Fasciola gigantica had the widest geographical distribution. It is envisaged that the present information will help in the formulation of disease-control policies, encourage on-farm good agricultural practices, and adequate hygiene and sanitation in abattoirs and meat-processing plants, with the aim of protecting public health.},

METHODS: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, the prevalence and distribution of helminths of veterinary and zoonotic importance in Nigerian ruminants were determined in a meta-analysis of data published between 1970 and 2016. Data were stratified based on regions, hosts, study periods, sample sizes and study types while helminths were phylogenetically grouped into cestodes, nematodes and trematodes. RESULTS: Data from 44 studies reported across 19 Nigerian states revealed an overall pooled prevalence estimate (PPE) of 7.48\% (95\% CI: 7.38-7.57) for helminths of veterinary and zoonotic importance from a total of 320 208 ruminants. We observed a significant variation (P {\textless} 0.001) between the PPEs range of 1.90\% (95\% CI: 1.78-2.02) and 60.98\% (95\% CI: 58.37-63.55) reported across different strata. High heterogeneity (99.78, 95\% CI: 7.38-7.57) was observed. Strongyloides papillosus was the most prevalent (Prev: 32.02\%, 95\% CI: 31.01-33.11), while, Fasciola gigantica had the widest geographical distribution. CONCLUSIONS: Helminths of veterinary and zoonotic importance are prevalent in ruminants and well distributed across Nigeria. Our findings show that helminths of ruminants may also be possible causes of morbidity in humans and economic losses in the livestock industry in Nigeria. High heterogeneity was observed within studies and the different strata. Good agricultural practices on farms, standard veterinary meat inspection and adequate hygiene and sanitation in abattoirs, farms and livestock markets need to be implemented in Nigeria in order to reduce the economic, public health and veterinary threats due to these helminths.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza A viruses of swine (IAV-S) are a global zoonotic and economic concern. Primary control is through vaccination yet a formal evidence map summarizing vaccine research conducted in pigs is not available. OBJECTIVE: Ten characteristics of English language primary IAV-S vaccine research, conducted at the level of the pig or higher, were charted to identify research gaps, topics for systematic review, and coverage across different publication types. DESIGN: Six online databases and grey literature were searched, without geographic, population, or study type restrictions, and abstracts screened independently and in duplicate for relevant research published between 1990 and May 2018. Full text data was charted by a single reviewer. RESULTS: Over 11,000 unique citations were screened, identifying 376 for charting, including 175 proceedings from 60 conferences, and 170 journal articles from 51 journals. Reported outcomes were heterogeneous with measures of immunity (86\%, n = 323) and virus detection (65\%, n = 246) reported far more than production metrics (9\%, n = 32). Study of transmissibility under conditions of natural exposure (n = 7), use of mathematical modelling (n = 11), and autogenous vaccine research reported in journals (n = 7), was limited. CONCLUSIONS: Most research used challenge trials (n = 219) and may have poor field relevance or suitability for systematic review if the purpose is to inform clinical decisions. Literature on vaccinated breeding herds (n = 89) and weaned pigs (n = 136) is potentially sufficient for systematic review. Research under field conditions is limited, disproportionately reported in conference proceedings versus journal articles, and may be insufficient to support systematic review.},

Here we present a systematic assessment of published research on zoonotic diseases in the region and thesis research in Kenya to understand the regional research focus and trends in publications, and estimate proportion of theses research transitioning to peer-reviewed journal publications. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar and African Journals Online databases for publications on 36 zoonotic diseases identified to have occurred in the East Africa countries of Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda, for the period between 1920 and 2017. We searched libraries and queried online repositories for masters and PhD theses on these diseases produced between 1970 and 2016 in five universities and two research institutions in Kenya. RESULTS: We identified 771 journal articles on 22, and 168 theses on 21 of the 36 zoonotic diseases investigated. Research on zoonotic diseases increased exponentially with the last 10 years of our study period contributing more than half of all publications 460 (60\%) and theses 102 (61\%) retrieved. Endemic diseases were the most studied accounting for 656 (85\%) and 150 (89\%) of the publication and theses studies respectively, with publications on epidemic diseases associated with outbreaks reported in the region or elsewhere. Epidemiological studies were the most common study types but limited to cross-sectional studies while socio-economics were the least studied. Only 11\% of the theses research transitioned to peer-review publications, taking an average of 2.5 years from theses production to manuscript publication. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate increased attention to zoonotic diseases in East Africa but reveal the need to expand the scope, focus and quality of studies to adequately address the public health, social and economic threats posed by zoonoses.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A wide range of Nipah virus (NiV) encephalitis case fatality rates (CFR) have been reported. Data on the involvement of several potential risk factors in Nipah virus transmission remain controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the pooled CFR of NiV encephalitis and to assess the risk factors for NiV infection. METHODS: Articles published up to the 27(th)of November 2018 in MedLine, Embase and Web of knowledge databases were considered for this study. We included cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies that have reported NiV CFR and/or risk factors. Data were pooled with random-effects model. This review was registered in the PROSPERO, CRD42018116242. FINDINGS: This global review included 22 citations (25 studies) including 2156, 1682, and 474 suspected, probable, and confirmed cases of NiV encephalitis, respectively. We determined a pooled CFR for NiV encephalitis at 61.0\% (95\% CI, 45.7-75.4; I² = 96.8\%). Climbing trees (OR = 1.4; 95\% CI; 1.0-1.9), male gender (OR = 1.5; 95\% CI; 1.1-2.0), travel outside their own sub-district (OR = 2.0; 95\% CI; 1.4-2.9), and exposure to date palm sap (DPS) (OR = 5.7; 95\% CI; 3.8-8.6) or pigs (OR = 7.6; 95\% CI; 1.2-45.4) were significantly associated with NiV infection. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study suggest that NiV Encephalitis is associated with a high CFR and that male gender, travel outside their sub-district, climbing trees, and exposure to pigs and DPS are associated with an increased risk of NiV encephalitis.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Existing evidence on the relationship between childhood lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) and the subsequent atopy development is controversial. We aimed to investigate an association between viral LRTI at {\textless}5 years and the development of atopy at {\textgreater} 2 years. METHODS: We conducted a search at Embase, Pubmed, Web of Science, and Global Index Medicus. We collected data from the included articles. We estimated the odds ratio and the 95\% confidence intervals with a random effect model. We determined factors associated with atopy development after childhood LRTI using univariate and multivariate meta-regression analyses. We recorded this systematic review at PROSPERO with the number CRD42018116955. RESULTS: We included 24 studies. There was no relationship between viral LRTI at {\textless}5 years and skin prick test-diagnosed-atopy (OR = 1.2, [95\% CI = 0.7-2.0]), unknown diagnosed-atopy (OR = 0.7, [95\% CI = 0.4-1.3]), atopic dermatitis (OR = 1.2, [95\% CI = 0.9-1.6]), hyperreactivity to pollen (OR = 0.8, [95\% CI = 0.3-2.7]), food (OR = 0.8, [95\% CI = 0.3-2.5]), or house dust mite (OR = 1.1, [95\% CI = 0.6-2.2]). Although not confirmed in all studies with a symmetric distribution of the 23 confounding factors investigated, the overall analyses showed that there was a relationship between childhood viral LRTI at {\textless} 5 years and serum test diagnosed-atopy (OR = 2.0, [95\% CI = 1.0-4.1]), allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (OR = 1.7, [95\% CI = 1.1-2.9]), hyperreactivity diagnosed by serum tests with food (OR = 5.3, [1.7-16.7]) or inhaled allergens (OR = 4.2, [95\% CI = 2.1-8.5]), or furred animals (OR = 0.6, [95\% CI = 0.5-0.9]). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that there is no association between viral LRTI at {\textless} 5 years and the majority of categories of atopy studied during this work. These results, however, are not confirmed for the remaining categories of atopy and more particularly those diagnosed by serum tests. There is a real need to develop more accurate atopy diagnostic tools.},

	abstract = {Accurate data on the Lassa virus (LASV) human case fatality rate (CFR) and the prevalence of LASV in humans, rodents and other mammals are needed for better planning of actions that will ultimately reduce the burden of LASV infection in sub-Saharan Africa. In this systematic review with meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Scopus, Africa Journal Online, and African Index Medicus from 1969 to 2020 to obtain studies that reported enough data to calculate LASV infection CFR or prevalence. Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently. We extracted all measures of current, recent, and past infections with LASV. Prevalence and CFR estimates were pooled using a random-effect meta-analysis. Factors associated with CFR, prevalence, and sources of between-study heterogeneity were determined using subgroup and metaregression analyses. This review was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020166465. We initially identified 1,399 records and finally retained 109 reports that contributed to 291 prevalence records from 25 countries. The overall CFR was 29.7\% (22.3-37.5) in humans. Pooled prevalence of LASV infection was 8.7\% (95\% confidence interval: 6.8-10.8) in humans, 3.2\% (1.9-4.6) in rodents, and 0.7\% (0.0-2.3) in other mammals. Subgroup and metaregression analyses revealed a substantial statistical heterogeneity explained by higher prevalence in tissue organs, in case-control, in hospital outbreak, and surveys, in retrospective studies, in urban and hospital setting, in hospitalized patients, and in West African countries. This study suggests that LASV infections is an important cause of death in humans and that LASV are common in humans, rodents and other mammals in sub-Saharan Africa. These estimates highlight disparities between sub-regions, and population risk profiles. Western Africa, and specific key populations were identified as having higher LASV CFR and prevalence, hence, deserving more attention for cost-effective preventive interventions.},

	abstract = {Fish farming in open water releases dissolved and particulate waste (inorganic and organic) into the surrounding marine environment. To reduce this environmental impact, commercial extractive species can be grown alongside to utilize and reduce this waste, a technique known as integrated multitrophic aquaculture (IMTA). Information is lacking on whether (i) IMTA is generally successful with respect to extractive species growth responses and (ii) at what spatial scale they can be cultivated from fish cage nutrient sources. Focussing on bivalves and macroalgae as extractive species, this study uses a meta-analysis approach to summarize and conclude peer-reviewed data on IMTA to address these information gaps. We show that there are clear benefits to integrating bivalves and macroalgae with fish farms. Bivalves grown within, and relatively near, fish cages (0 m and 1-60 m distance categories, respectively) showed significantly higher biomass production relative to controls compared to those grown at larger spatial scales (61+ m). However, biomass production of macroalgae was significantly higher than controls only within close proximity to fish cages (0 m). This information shows increased extractive species production is generally greatest at relatively small spatial scales. It also highlights the need for more site-specific information (e.g. seawater parameters, hydrodynamics, food supply, farm capacity) in future studies. The allocation of control sites and locating these at suitable distances ({\textgreater}1-8 km) from fish farm effluent sources to avoid fish farm nutrient contamination are also recommended.},

A systematic review of the papers published in Persian and English languages up to 20th May 2019 and indexed in the Scientific Information Database, PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar databases using related keywords was conducted. Eligible articles were selected based on the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, followed by data extraction and meta-analysis using random-effects or fixed-effects models. A total of 27 articles were found reporting antibiotic resistance patterns of different Listeria species using disk diffusion method. Among Listeria species, Listeria monocytogenes resistance to commonly used antibiotics i.e. penicillin, ampicillin and gentamicin was as follows: 34.5\%, 26.4\%, 8.9\% in isolates from foods and food processing environments, 47.1\%, 29.5\%, 9.2\% in isolates from animal specimens and 56.8\%, 29.5\%, 32.4\% in human strains, respectively. A high prevalence of L. monocytogenes strains resistant to penicillin, ampicillin and gentamicin was observed in Iran. Our findings suggested that trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin and ciprofloxacin can be used as alternatives in the treatment of human listeriosis in Iran due to their low resistance rates.},

However, there is little knowledge about the prevalence of their resistance to antibiotics in Iran. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Clostridium species in Iran through a meta-analysis of eligible studies published up until December 2018. Fourteen articles on the drug resistance of Clostridium species in Iran were included in the current study following a search in PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar databases using relevant keywords and screening based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Antibiotic resistance rates of C. difficile to ampicillin (42.8\%), ciprofloxacin (69.5\%), clindamycin (84.3\%), erythromycin (61.5\%), gentamicin (93.5\%), nalidixic acid (92.9\%), tetracycline (32.5\%), imipenem (39.6\%), levofloxacin (93.4\%), ertapenem (58.7\%), piperacillin/tazobactam (56.5\%), kanamycin (100\%), colistin (100\%), ceftazidime (76\%), amikacin (76.5\%), moxifloxacin (67.9\%) and cefotaxime (95\%) were high. In addition, resistance of C. perfringens to ampicillin (25.8\%), erythromycin (32.9\%), gentamicin (45.4\%), nalidixic acid (52.5\%), tetracycline (19.5\%), penicillin (21.8\%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (32.1\%), amoxicillin (19.3\%), imipenem (38\%), cloxacillin (100\%), oxacillin (45.6\%), bacitracin (89.1\%) and colistin (40\%) was high. Metronidazole and vancomycin, as the first-line therapies, fidaxomicin, tetracyclines (except tetracycline), rifampicin and chloramphenicol can still be used for the treatment of C. difficile infections. However, the present results do not recommend the use of penicillin, bacitracin and tetracycline for the treatment of C. perfringens infections in humans and domestic animals in Iran.},

We performed a systematic review to determine the exact status of E. granulosus genotypes in the country. We explored English (Pubmed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science and Science Direct) and Persian (Magiran, Iran Medex and Scientific Information Database) databases along with Google Scholar. Our review included 73 studies published prior to the end of 2015. In total, 2952 animal (intermediate and definitive) hosts were examined, and the prevalent genotypes comprised G1 (92.75\%) and G6 (4.53\%) in sheep, cattle, camels, goats and buffaloes; G3 (2.43\%) in five herbivore hosts and dogs; G7 (0.2\%) in sheep and goats; and G2 (0.06\%) in dogs. G1 was mostly dominant in West Azerbaijan, whereas G3 and G6 were identified most frequently in the provinces of Isfahan and Fars, respectively. Regarding human CE infection, 340 cases were reported from Iran, with the identified genotypes G1 (n = 320), G6 (n = 13) and G3 (n = 7). Most CE-infected humans originated from Isfahan province (168 cases), whereas the lowest number of infected persons was noted in Kerman province (two cases). The information obtained from this systematic review is central to better understanding the biological and epidemiological characteristics of E. granulosus s.l. genotypes in Iran, leading to more comprehensive control strategies.},

Egger's regression test revealed no significant publication bias (P = 0.307). Also, there was no remarkable correlation between weighted prevalence and sample size (P = 0.249) as well as year of study (P = 0.172).

Although leptospirosis is known as an endemic disease in Iran, there is no accurate information on the overall prevalence of this disease in humans and animals. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the seroprevalence of leptospirosis among human and domestic and wild animals in Iran. A systematic review of English and Persian articles (since 1998 to December 2017) was conducted using Google Scholar, Medline/PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of science and Iranian databases Iranmedex, Scientific Information Database (SID), Magiran, and IRANDOC. Search terms include leptospirosis, Leptospira, serology, seroprevalence, seroepidemiology, serological, Iran, cow, goat, sheep, camel, dog, cat, equine, donkey, horse, mule and rodent. In Eventually 66 articles were selected to analyze based on inclusion criteria. Seroprevalence of leptospirosis in human was 27.84\% (95\% CI: 13.22-22.47) and 19.71\% (95\% CI: 6.78-32.65\%) based on ELISA and MAT, respectively. The pooled prevalence of leptospirosis in cow, sheep, goat and camel was 26.62\% (95\% CI: 18.76-34.48), 17.38\% (95\% CI: 13.32-21.43), 12.18\% (95\% CI: 9.96-14.41) and 22.68\% (95\% CI: 18.97-26.40), respectively. The prevalence of leptospirosis in horse, donkey, and mule was 19.99\% (95\% CI: 13.32-26.68), 40.59\% (95\% CI: 33.20-47.97) and 9.10\% (95\% CI: 2.90-15.30), respectively. The prevalence in dog and cat were estimated 14.63\% (95\% CI: 3.49-25.77) and 14.44\% (95\% CI: 3.25-25.65), respectively. The prevalence of seropositivity in rodents was estimated 20.96\% (95\% CI: 10.62-31.30). This study is a very comprehensive report on the status of leptospirosis in Iran. Based on our results, leptospirosis has considerable seroprevalence among human and animals in Iran. This high seroprevalence of leptospirosis showed should be given more attention for this disease in Iran and thus health measures must be taken to diagnosis, control and prevent it.},

There are studies on the prevalence of this infection in animal and human reservoirs in Iran; hence, we conducted this meta-analysis to elucidate the prevalence of CE in Iran. English (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct and Google Scholar) and Persian (Magiran, Iran Medex, Iran Doc and SID) databases were explored. In the case of definitive, animal and human intermediate hosts, 37, 90 and 33 studies, respectively, have been included in the current review from January 1990 to December 2015. According to outcomes of the heterogeneity test, either Der Simonian and Laird's random-effects method or Mantel-Haenszel's fixed-effects method were employed to pool the estimations. The pooled prevalence of Echinococcus granulosus infection in definitive hosts was calculated as 23.6\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) = 17.6-30.1\%). The weighted prevalence of animal and human hydatidosis was calculated as 15.6\% (95\% CI = 14.2-17.1\%) and 4.2\% (95\% CI = 3.0-5.5\%), respectively. Meanwhile, most cases of human hydatidosis were in southern Iran, with a prevalence of 5.8\% (3.2-9.2\%). In terms of human hydatidosis, more infections were found in rural regions, and mostly in female individuals. Egger's regression test revealed publication bias, with a remarkable impact on total prevalence of the infection in animal intermediate hosts (P {\textless} 0.001), while it was not significant in human hosts (P = 0.4) and definitive hosts (P = 0.3).

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pntd.0006722},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tick-borne zoonoses in the Order Rickettsiales and Legionellales cause infections that often manifest as undifferentiated fevers that are not easy to distinguish from other causes of acute febrile illnesses clinically. This is partly attributed to difficulty in laboratory confirmation since convalescent sera, specific diagnostic reagents, and the required expertise may not be readily available. As a result, a number of tick-borne zoonoses are underappreciated resulting in unnecessary morbidity, mortality and huge economic loses. In Iran, a significant proportion of human infectious diseases are tick-borne, with anecdotal evidence suggesting that tick-borne zoonoses are widespread but underreported in the country. Epidemiological review is therefore necessary to aid in the effective control and prevention of tick-borne zonooses in Iran. The aim of this review is to provide an in-depth and comprehensive overview of anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, spotted fever group rickettsioses and coxiellosis in Iran. METHODS: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, all relevant publications on tick-borne zoonoses in the Order Rickettsiales and Legionellales in Iran were searched using a number of search terms. The search was confined to authentic resources from repositories of popular data bases among them PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Science Direct, SpringerLink and SCOPUS. The search items included peer reviewed journals, books and book chapters published between 1996 and 2017. RESULTS: A total of 1 205 scientific publications and reports were sourced, of which 63 met the search criteria and were reviewed. Of the 63 articles reviewed, 36 (57.1\%) reported on coxiellosis, 15 (23.8\%) on anaplasmosis, 11 (17.5\%) on ehrlichiosis and 1(1.6\%) on spotted fever group rickettsiae in a large scale study involving four countries, among them Iran. The existence of tick-borne pathogens in the Order Rickettsiales and Legionellales was confirmed by molecular, serological and microscopic techniques conducted on samples obtained from sheep, cattle, goats, camels, poultry, animal products (milk and eggs), dogs, ticks and even human subjects in different parts of the country; pointing to a countrywide distribution. DISCUSSION: Based on the review, coxiellosis, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, and SFG rickettsiae can be categorized as emerging tick-borne zoonotic diseases in Iran given the presence of their causiative agents (C. burnetii, A. phagocytophilum, A. marginale, A. bovis, A. ovis, A. central, E. canis, E. ewingii, E. chaffeensis and R. conorii) collectively reported in a variety of domestic animals, animal products, arthropods and human beings drawn from 22 provinces in Iran. CONCLUSION: Given the asymptomatic nature of some of these zoonoses, there is a high likelihood of silent transmission to humans in many parts of the country, which should be considered a public health concern. Presently, information on the transmission intensity of tick-borne zoonoses caused by pathogens in the Order Rickettsiales and Legionellales to humans and its public health impact in Iran is scanty.},

	abstract = {Equines are subject to infection with many parasites, which threaten their health. In the present study, we systematically reviewed existing literature on the prevalence of endo- and ectoparasites of equines in Iran. Major electronic databases, including PubMed, PubMed Central, Google Scholar, Science Direct and Scientific Information Database (SID), were searched (Last updated 11/05/2018) for relevant literature of parasites that have been identified from equines in Iran. Of the 1809 titles produced by bibliographic search, 38 were included in the review. Twenty-seven of the studies were on horses, six on donkeys, three on both horses and donkeys, and one study was on both horses and mules. Furthermore, 24 of the studies reported infections caused by protozoa, thirteen by helminths, two by ectoparasites, and one by both protozoa and helminths. The overall pooled prevalence of parasitic infection was 28.8\% (95\%CI: 22.9-35.7, I(2)  = 93.4\%). Helminths were the most prevalent parasites 46.7\% (95\% CI: 24.1-70.7, I(2)  = 96.0\%). Furthermore, donkeys were the most affected equine, with a prevalence of 70.7\% (95\% CI: 53.2-83.7, I(2)  = 92.5\%). The protozoa frequently reported included nine species belonging to the genera: Neospora, Toxoplasma, Theileria, Babesia and Eimeria. Also, the helminths frequently reported included 21 species belonging to the genera: Strongylus, Dicrocoelium, Oxyuris, Habronema, Echinococcus, Dictyocaulus, Cyathostomum, Probstmayria, Anoplocephala, Setaria and Fasciola. Ticks were the only ectoparasites frequently reported. Parasitic fly species of the genera Gasterophilus were also reported. The study-level risk of bias was likely to be high because of differences in study design. Parasitic infections of equines in Iran are frequent and caused by a diversity of parasites, which threatens the health and well-being of these animals. Further research is needed in the area to identify the risk factors of infection for effective control of the parasites.},

In spite of substantial progress in understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms, treatment options are still limited, often expensive for common people in most parts of the world. As a result, there is a great interest in herbal remedies for the treatment of urinary stone disease as an alternative or adjunct therapy. Numerous in vivo and in vitro studies have been carried out to understand the efficacy of herbs in reducing stone formation. We adopted PRISMA guidelines and systematically reviewed PubMed/Medline for the literature, reporting results of various herbal products on in vivo models of nephrolithiasis/urolithiasis. The Medical Subject Heading Terms (Mesh term) "Urolithiasis" was used with Boolean operator "AND" and other related Mesh Unique terms to search all the available records (July 2019). A total of 163 original articles on in vivo experiments were retrieved from PubMed indexed with the (MeshTerm) "Urolithiasis" AND "Complementary Therapies/Alternative Medicine, "Urolithiasis" AND "Plant Extracts" and "Urolithiasis" AND "Traditional Medicine". Most of the studies used ethylene glycol (EG) to induce hyperoxaluria and nephrolithiasis in rats. A variety of extraction methods including aqueous, alcoholic, hydro-alcoholic of various plant parts ranging from root bark to fruits and seeds, or a combination thereof, were utilized. All the investigations did not study all aspects of nephrolithiasis making it difficult to compare the efficacy of various treatments. Changes in the lithogenic factors and a reduction in calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystal deposition in the kidneys were, however, considered favorable outcomes of the various treatments. Less than 10\% of the studies examined antioxidant and diuretic activities of the herbal treatments and concluded that their antiurolithic activities were a result of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and/or diuretic effects of the treatments.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is reported as one of the most common cancers among females worldwide. Infectious agents especially viruses have been considered as role players in the development of breast cancer. Although some investigations suggest an association between bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and breast cancer, the involvement of this virus as a risk factor remains controversial. The present study aimed to find out any possible association between BLV and breast cancer through conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Systematic literature search was performed by finding related case-control articles from the PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE databases. The heterogeneity and the multivariable-adjusted OR and corresponding 95\% CI were applied by meta-analysis and forest plot across studies. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14.1. RESULT: Based on a comprehensive literature search, 9 case-control studies were included for meta-analysis. The combination of all included studies showed that BLV infection is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer [summary OR (95\% CI) 2.57 (1.45, 4.56)]. CONCLUSION: This is the first meta-analysis to analyze a potential association between BLV infection and the risk of breast cancer. Control of the infection in cattle herds and screening of the milk and dairy products may help to reduce the transmission of the virus to humans.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the last decade resveratrol has been trialled for the prevention and treatment of cognitive decline; however, the results have shown a conflict between human studies compared with animal studies, especially on cognition, blood pressure, neuroimaging, and mood. METHODS: Human clinical trials and animal studies published prior to January 2020, were identified searching across major electronic databases. PRISMA guidelines were used for data extraction, which was independently performed by two authors. Pooled standard mean difference (SMD, random effect model) and odds ratios (ORs) were calculated. RESULTS: Most publications on animal models reported positive outcomes on cognition and brain function following exposure to resveratrol or grape seed extracts. By contrast, 11 meta-analyses of data from human placebo vs resveratrol, grape or wine treatment trials identified no statistically significant effect on a variety of measures, including cognitive and mood assessments, grey matter volume and blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: Based on currently available data, the promising effects of resveratrol in animal models is not replicated in human clinical trials. The effects, if any, of resveratrol on human cognition are likely to be small. This work may be useful for the design and implementation of future pre-clinical and clinical studies using resveratrol in a neurological setting.},

	abstract = {Cancer and infectious diseases are the preeminent causes of human morbidities and mortalities worldwide. At present, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and gene therapy are considered as predominant options in order to treat cancer. But these therapies provide inadequate consequences by affecting both the normal and tumor cells. On the other hand, tuberculosis (TB), and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infections are significant threats, causing over a million mortalities each year. The extensive applications of antibiotics have caused the microbes to acquire resistance to the existing antibiotics. With the emerging dilemma of drug resistant microbes, it has become imperative to identify novel therapeutic agents from natural sources as emphatic alternative approach. Over the past few decades, venoms derived from several reptiles, amphibians, and arthropods including snakes, scorpions, frogs, spiders, honey bees, wasps, beetles, caterpillars, ants, centipedes, and sponges have been identified as efficient therapeutics. Venoms constitute plethora of bioactive components, particularly peptides, enzymes, and other chemical entities, which exhibit a large array of anticancer and anti-pathogenic activities. This review highlights the panorama of bioactive components of animal venoms divulging the anticancer, anti-tubercular, and anti-HIV activities. In a nutshell, this context discloses the decisive role of animal venoms as alternative natural resources to combat these deadly diseases of 21(st) century, and propounding the plausible development of new therapeutic drugs in the present era.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sparganosis is a larval cestodiasis caused by the plerocercoid of Spirometra spp. Since the first description of human sparganosis in 1924, several hundred cases have been reported in Korea. However, systematic approaches for literature surveys of Korean sparganosis have seldom appeared. METHODS: We searched publicly available databases such as PubMed, Research Information Sharing Service, and Korea Medical Citation Index with relevant Medical Subject Headings. RESULTS: At least 438 Korean sparganosis cases have been described from 1924 to 2015. Preoperative diagnosis has been significantly increased since the 1980s due to popularization of serological and imaging diagnostics. Cases were largely detected from fifth decades in general, but cerebral sparganosis was detected in relatively young age groups (third and fourth decades). Sparganosis was prevalent in men (75.9\%). Consumption of frog/snake and drinking unfiltered water were found in 63.4\% and 16.9\% of patients, respectively. Most frequently affected sites were subcutaneous tissues (49.9\%), followed by the central nervous system (36.2\%). Involvements of visceral organs (7.6\%), ocular regions (3.6\%), and muscles (2.7\%) were noticed. In women, breast sparganosis constituted a large proportion (34.2\%). Sparganosis associated with immunocompromised patients has recently been reported. CONCLUSION: Sparganosis has been continuously reported in Korea during the past 90 years, although its incidence has decreased during the last 20 years. The disease is mostly characterized by subcutaneous nodule, but infection of the worm in vital organs often results in serious illness. Continuous awareness is warranted to monitor sparganosis occurrence and associated clinical consequences.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Globally cryptosporidiosis is one of the commonest causes of mortality in children under 24 months old and may be associated with important longterm health effects. Whilst most strains of Cryptosporidium parvum are zoonotic, C. parvum IIc is almost certainly anthroponotic. The global distribution of this potentially important emerging infection is not clear. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of papers identifying the subtype distribution of C. parvum infections globally. We searched PubMed and Scopus using the following key terms Cryptospor* AND parvum AND (genotyp* OR subtyp* OR gp60). Studies were eligible for inclusion if they had found C. parvum within their human study population and had subtyped some or all of these samples using standard gp60 subtyping. Pooled analyses of the proportion of strains being of the IIc subtype were determined using StatsDirect. Meta-regression analyses were run to determine any association between the relative prevalence of IIc and Gross Domestic Product, proportion of the population with access to improved drinking water and improved sanitation. RESULTS: From an initial 843 studies, 85 were included in further analysis. Cryptosporidium parvum IIc was found in 43 of these 85 studies. Across all studies the pooled estimate of relative prevalence of IIc was 19.0\% (95\% CI: 12.9-25.9\%), but there was substantial heterogeneity. In a meta-regression analysis, the relative proportion of all C. parvum infections being IIc decreased as the percentage of the population with access to improved sanitation increased and was some 3.4 times higher in those studies focussing on HIV-positive indivduals. CONCLUSIONS: The anthroponotic C. parvum IIc predominates primarily in lower-income countries with poor sanitation and in HIV-positive individuals. Given the apparent enhanced post-infectious virulence of the other main anthroponotic species of Cryptosporidium (C. hominis), it is important to learn about the impact of this subtype on human health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evidence-based treatments for service-related health conditions such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are not effective for all veterans. Equine-assisted interventions are emerging as an additional treatment modality, but little is known regarding the safe and effective delivery of these interventions. This study aimed to describe the following features of the body of literature concerning equine-assisted interventions among veterans: 1) veterans who have participated in equine-assisted interventions; 2) specific characteristics of equine-assisted interventions in veterans; and 3) the specific characteristics of research on equine-assisted interventions in veterans. METHODS: We conducted a systematic mapping review of peer-reviewed literature reporting on equine-assisted interventions among veterans between 1980 and 2017. Searches of nine databases yielded 3336 unique records, six of which met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Data relevant to the study aims were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: Equine-assisted interventions among veterans disproportionately targeted psychosocial outcomes and yielded promising results. The detailed methods of EAI varied in the reported studies, ranging from communicating with the horse to mounted exercises. There was also great diversity in outcome measurement. The state of theoretical development regarding the mechanisms by which equine-assisted interventions benefit the veteran population is currently underdeveloped. Studies provided insufficient detail with respect to the description of the intervention, reasons for attrition, and the dose-response relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Scientific development of equine-assisted interventions targeting psychosocial outcomes among veterans is warranted to establish their efficacy. Targeted outcomes should be expanded, including outcomes more closely aligned with the nature of polytraumatic injuries. Future research must also emphasize the theoretical development of equine-assisted interventions for veterans and thoroughly describe the participants, components of the intervention, factors contributing to attrition, and optimal dose-response relationships.},

	abstract = {The neurotransmitter Substance P, and its neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R) are involved in the regulation of many pathophysiological processes including emesis, inflammation and nociceptive processing. This review provides a brief summary of the anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties of experimental NK-1R antagonists followed by a systematic review and meta-analysis on maropitant, the only NK-1R antagonist with a label indication for emesis in veterinary patients. There is very limited evidence based information on the putative clinical utilisation of maropitant for pain and inflammation. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate published reports on anti-inflammatory, analgesic and anaesthesia-sparing effects of maropitant. Medline, Pubmed, Science direct and Web of Science were searched to identify all published studies on maropitant, followed by a meta-analysis. Fourteen studies with 128 animals receiving maropitant and 127 controls met the inclusion criteria. Overall, maropitant had a significant inhalation anaesthetic-sparing effect (SMD -0.92, 95\% CI -1.30, -0.54; P {\textless} 0.00001). However, treatment with maropitant had no effect on pain (SMD 0.06, 95\% CI -0.37, 0.48; P = 0.80), or leukocyte cell infiltration in different inflammatory conditions (SMD -0.60, 95\% CI -1.31, 0.11; P = 0.10). Based on all eligible studies for this review, it can be deduced that maropitant significantly reduced the minimum alveolar concentrations for isoflurane and sevoflurane for many different surgical procedures but it had no clearly proven effect on inflammation and pain.},

Chronic rejection (CR) remains the key obstacle for long-term intestinal graft survival but the pathomechanisms are incompletely understood.

A systematic literature search was conducted in line with the PRISMA guidelines, and 68 out of 677 articles qualified for the final analysis. The average methodological quality of the studies was suboptimal with 7 out of 11 points as assessed by a modified Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine score. Histology of the chronically rejected graft was almost universally integrated as outcome parameter but we found significant heterogeneity in utilized transplant techniques, organ preservation, immunosuppression and time points of CR-assessment. Several studies identified cellular and humoral immunologic mechanisms in chronic intestinal rejection. Yet, neither preventive nor therapeutic strategies against CR have been successfully introduced into human intestinal transplantation highlighting the persistent need for optimized experimental models. In this review, we aim to improve the translational value of forthcoming investigations on CR by discussing the experimental status quo and potential innovative approaches.},

	abstract = {The global burden of antimicrobial resistance is on the rise, resulting in higher morbidity and mortality in our communities. The spread of antimicrobial resistance in the environment and development of resistant microbes is a challenge to the control of antimicrobial resistance. Approaches, such as antimicrobial stewardship programmes and enhanced surveillance, have been devised to curb its spread. However, particularly in lower- and middle-income countries, the overall extent of antimicrobial resistance and knowledge on ongoing surveillance, stewardship or investigation efforts, are often poorly understood. This study aimed to look at the efforts that have been undertaken to detect and combat antimicrobial resistance in Uganda as a means of establishing an overview of the situation, to help inform future decisions. We conducted a systematic literature review of the PubMed database to assess these efforts. A search combining keywords associated with antimicrobial resistance were used to find relevant studies between 1995 and 2020 on surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in Uganda, and susceptibility of microbes to different drugs. The search yielded 430 records, 163 of which met the inclusion criteria for analysis. The studies were categorized according to country and region, the type of antimicrobial resistance, context of the study, study design and outcome of the study. We observed that antibacterial resistance and antimalarial resistance had the most published studies while antiviral and antifungal resistance were represented by very few studies each. Most studies were conducted in humans and hospital settings, with few in veterinary and One Health contexts, and only one that included environmental sampling. The majority of studies have focused on surveillance, susceptibility testing or resistance genes; none of our included papers had a policy or stewardship focus. The results from our work can inform public health policy on antimicrobial stewardship as it contributes to understanding the status of antimicrobial resistance surveillance in Uganda, and can also help to guide future research efforts. Notably, a One Health approach needs to be followed with respect to surveillance of antimicrobial resistance to better understand the mechanisms of resistance transfer across the human-animal-environment interface, including additional investigation in antiviral and antifungal resistance.},

	abstract = {Fibrotic interstitial pneumonias are a group of rare diseases characterised by distortion of lung interstitium. Patients with mutations in surfactant-processing genes, such as surfactant protein C (SFTPC), surfactant protein A1 and A2 (SFTPA1 and A2), ATP binding cassette A3 (ABCA3) and Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS1, 2 and 4), develop progressive pulmonary fibrosis, often culminating in fatal respiratory insufficiency. Although many mutations have been described, little is known about the optimal treatment strategy for fibrotic interstitial pneumonia patients with surfactant-processing mutations.We performed a systematic literature review of studies that described a drug effect in patients, cell or mouse models with a surfactant-processing mutation. In total, 73 articles were selected, consisting of 55 interstitial lung disease case reports/series, two clinical trials and 16 cell or mouse studies. Clinical effect parameters included lung function, radiological characteristics and clinical symptoms, while experimental outcome parameters included chemokine/cytokine expression, surfactant trafficking, necrosis and apoptosis. SP600125, a c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor, hydroxychloroquine and 4-phenylbutyric acid were most frequently studied in disease models and lead to variable outcomes, suggesting that outcome is mutation dependent.This systematic review summarises effect parameters for future studies on surfactant-processing disorders in disease models and provides directions for future trials in affected patients.},

Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of animal assisted therapy (AAT) with special focus on canis therapy among people with dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The key method of this review study is a systematic review of the research studies detected in the Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed. The search was conducted for the studies dating from 2016 till 31 August 2018 because several review studies were published before. Eventually, only six studies were involved into the final analysis. RESULTS: The findings of this review, based on significant effect sizes, reveal that AAT may work as a beneficial and effective complementary treatment, especially in the area of behavioral and psychological symptoms, for patients with different degree of dementia severity if AAT is targeted at their specific needs and interests. CONCLUSIONS: More research in the area of methodology for the implementation of AAT is necessary, and more research should be conducted with respect to the use of AAT for the improvement of cognitive functions in people with dementia.},

Recently, metabolomics has become important for understanding the functional relevance of gut microbial changes in disease. Animal models for IBD enable the study of factors involved in disease development. However, results from animal studies may not represent the human situation. The aim of this study was to investigate whether results from metabolomics studies on animal models for IBD were similar to those from studies on IBD patients. Medline and Embase were searched for relevant studies up to May 2017. The Covidence systematic review software was used for study screening, and quality assessment was conducted for all included studies. Data showed a convergence of {\textasciitilde}17\% for metabolites differentiated between IBD and controls in human and animal studies with amino acids being the most differentiated metabolite subclass. The acute dextran sodium sulfate model appeared as a good model for analysis of systemic metabolites in IBD, but analytical platform, age, and biological sample type did not show clear correlations with any significant metabolites. In conclusion, this systematic review highlights the variation in metabolomics results, and emphasizes the importance of expanding the applied detection methods to ensure greater coverage and convergence between the various different patient phenotypes and animal models of inflammatory bowel disease.},

However, a systemic analysis of these beneficial effects has yet to be performed. Objective: To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of acupuncture in animal models of PD. Methods: A literature search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Research Information Service System, and Japan Society of Acupuncture and Moxibustion databases was performed to retrieve studies that investigated the effects of acupuncture on PD. The quality of each included study was evaluated using the 10-item checklist modified from the Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies. RevMan version 5.3 (Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used for meta-analysis. Results: The 42 studies included scored between 2 and 7 points, with a mean score of 4.6. Outcome measures included tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) level and dopamine content. Meta-analysis results revealed statistically significant effects of acupuncture for increasing both TH levels (33.97 [95\% CI 33.15-34.79]; p {\textless} 0.00001) and dopamine content (4.23 [95\% CI 3.53-4.92]; p {\textless} 0.00001) compared with that observed in PD control groups. In addition, motor dysfunctions exhibited by model PD animals were also mitigated by acupuncture treatment. Conclusions: Although there were limitations in the number and quality of the included studies, results of this analysis suggest that acupuncture exerts a protective effect on dopaminergic neurons in rodent models of PD.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) in healthcare settings challenges clinicians worldwide. However, little is known about dissemination of CRE in livestock, food, and companion animals and potential transmission to humans. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of all studies published in the PubMed database between 1980 and 2017 and included those reporting the occurrence of CRE in samples from food-producing and companion animals, wildlife, and exposed humans. The primary outcome was the occurrence of CRE in samples from these animals; secondary outcomes included the prevalence of CRE, carbapenemase types, CRE genotypes, and antimicrobial susceptibilities. RESULTS: We identified 68 articles describing CRE among pigs, poultry, cattle, seafood, dogs, cats, horses, pet birds, swallows, wild boars, wild stork, gulls, and black kites in Africa, America, Asia, Australia, and Europe. The following carbapenemases have been detected (predominantly affecting the genera Escherichia and Klebsiella): VIM, KPC, NDM, OXA, and IMP. Two studies found that 33-67\% of exposed humans on poultry farms carried carbapenemase-producing CRE closely related to isolates from the farm environment. Twenty-seven studies selectively screened samples for CRE and found a prevalence of {\textless}1\% among livestock and companion animals in Europe, 2-26\% in Africa, and 1-15\% in Asia. Wildlife (gulls) in Australia and Europe carried CRE in 16-19\%. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of CRE in livestock, seafood, wildlife, pets, and directly exposed humans poses a risk for public health. Prospective prevalence studies using molecular and cultural microbiological methods are needed to better define the scope and transmission of CRE.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Damage to critical brain regions causes deficits in important neurological functions. Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) has been shown to promote neuroplasticity and may ameliorate neurological deficits caused by disease or trauma. This systematic review identifies and evaluates preclinical studies of ChABC as a treatment for acute brain injury. METHODS: Four databases were searched for studies relating to ChABC and brain or brain injuries. Controlled studies in mammals with acute brain injuries treated with ChABC were included in meta-analyses of neurobehavioural outcomes. Means and standard deviations from the fifth day of treatment were extracted, and normalised mean differences were calculated. RESULTS: Of 775 identified records, 16 studies administered ChABC after acute brain injury, of which 9 reported neurobehavioural outcomes. The estimated treatment effect on neurological recovery over the duration of included studies was 49.4\% (CI: 30.3-68.4\% with Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman adjustment, p = 0.0002). The mechanisms of action may involve decreasing astroglial scar formation, promoting neuronal sprouting, and selective synaptic strengthening of sprouting neurites and activated neural pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The summary of published evidence suggests that ChABC treatment is effective in improving neurological outcomes in preclinical models of acute brain injury. However, more studies are needed for better assessment of the specific translational potential of ChABC.

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To provide a systematic literature review on effectiveness of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and Shunt (AVS) research animal models. BACKGROUND: Due to advancing human population age, there is increased incidence of patients suffering from vascular and renal diseases leading to dialysis access using AVF and/or AVS. During those interventions native venous or synthetic grafts are arterialized. Despite temporary good patency, complications are a consequence of neointimal hyperplasia (NIH) development that contributes to patients' morbidity and mortality. Basic research attempts to elucidate the pathomechanisms, therefore the small and large animal models are becoming attractive. METHODS: Medline search (within 1966-2018) was performed on AVF/AVS animal models. Studies fulfilled following criteria: (1) reported complete material-methods-results section, (2) included statistically significant number of animals, (3) provided statistically significant results. 55 articles were identified encompassing six animal species used. RESULTS: Large animal models include creation of AVF and AVS in pig, sheep and dog. Porcine animal models use pelvic or femoral vessels, ovine use the common carotid artery (CCA) and jugular vein (JV). Canine animal models use the femoral vessels. Small animal models use rabbit (CCA/JV), rat (JV/CCA, abdominal aorta /Vena cava inferior and femoral artery/femoral vein) and mouse (aortocaval and supraortic AVF models). CONCLUSIONS: Large animal models are best for haemodynamic shear stress studies and in vivo evaluation of new synthetic vascular grafts. Small animal models, especially the genetically manipulated ones, are ideal for analysis of molecular and cellular pathomechanisms. The selection of animal species to be used depends on the addressed research question.},

RESULTS: Nine studies (1 clinical and 8 studies performed in animal-models) were included. Six studies used Simvastatin, whereas three studies used Atorvastatin. Six experimental studies and one clinical study reported reduction in OTM upon statin administration. Two experimental studies reported no effect of statin administration on OTM. In 90 \% of the studies, the risk-of-bias was high. CONCLUSION: Based upon the high risk-of-bias and methodological inconsistencies among the included studies, the influence of statin delivery on OTM remains debatable.},

FGR is postulated to impact blood pressure (BP) by developmental programming. This systematic review and meta-analysis studies BP in human and animal offspring following FGR. Pubmed and Web of Science were searched for studies reporting on BP after placental insufficiency induced FGR compared with normal growth controls. Primary outcome was mean absolute BP difference (ΔBP mm Hg [95\% CI]). Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses were executed on species, sex, age, pregnancy duration, and stress during BP readings. Due to large interspecies heterogeneity, analyses were performed separately for human (n=41) and animal (n=31) studies, the latter restricted to rats (n=27). Human studies showed a ΔBP between FGR and controls of -0.6 mm Hg ([95\% CI, -1.7 to 0.6]; I(2)=91\%). Mean ΔBP was -2.6 mm Hg (95\% CI, -5.7 to 0.4) in women versus -0.5 mm Hg (95\% CI, -3.7 to 2.7) in men. Subgroup analyses did not indicate age, gestational age, and stress during measurements as sources of heterogeneity. In rats, mean BP was 12.0 mm Hg ([95\% CI, 8.8-15.2]; I(2)=81\%) higher in FGR offspring. This difference was more pronounced in FGR males (13.6 mm Hg [95\% CI, 10.3-17.0] versus 9.1 mm Hg [95\% CI, 5.3-12.8]). Subgroup analyses on age showed no statistical interaction. BP readings under restrained conditions resulted in larger BP differences between FGR and control rats (15.3 mm Hg [95\% CI, 11.6-18.9] versus 5.7 mm Hg [95\% CI, 1.1-10.3]). Rat studies confirm the relation between FGR and offspring BP, while observational studies in humans do not show such differences. This may be due to the observational nature of human studies, methodological limitations, or an absence of this phenomenon in humans. Clinical Trial Registration URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

A systematic search was conducted using the following databases: WoS, PubMed, SCOPUS, and MEDLINE. Inclusion criteria were: rat hypersensitivity induced by models of neuropathic pain with reported effects of MC4R antagonist. Two researchers performed the selection process and data extraction. SYRCLE risk of bias tool was used. Standard mean differences (SMD) were calculated and pooled by meta-analysis using random effect models. Ten articles met the eligibility criteria and were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The results reveal that, in animals exposed to neuropathic pain, administration of MC4R antagonists significantly increased paw withdrawal threshold (SHU9119 SMD = 1.67, 95\% CI: [0.91, 2.44], I(2)  = 0\%; HS014 SMD = 2.2, 95\% CI: [0.53, 3.87], I(2)  = 71\%) and heat withdrawal latency (HS014 SMD = 3.35, 95\% CI: [0.56, 6.14], I(2)  = 83\%) compared to vehicle-treated animals. MC4R antagonists are effective in the alleviation of hypersensitivity in rodent neuropathic pain models. SHU9119 and HS014 antagonists showed the most prominent results. However, further investigation is needed to determine the optimal dose and time of treatment.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Fabry disease (FD) is a rare lysosomal storage disorder that might result in, amongst other complications, early stroke and white matter lesions (WMLs). More insight in WMLs in FD could clarify the role of WMLs in the disease presentation and prognosis in FD. In this systematic review we assessed the prevalence, severity, location and course of WMLs in FD. We also systematically reviewed the evidence on the relation between WMLs, disease characteristics and clinical parameters. METHODS: We searched Pubmed, EMBASE and CINAHL (inception to Feb 2018) and identified articles reporting on FD and WMLs assessed with MRI. Prevalence and severity were assessed for all patients combined and divided by sex. RESULTS: Out of 904 studies a total of 46 studies were included in the analyses. WMLs were present in 46\% of patients with FD (581 out of 1276 patients, corrected mean age: 38.8 years, range 11.8-79.3) and increased with age. A total of 16.4\% of patients (31 out of 189 patients, corrected mean age: 41.1 years, range 35.8-43.3 years) showed substantial confluent WMLs. Men and women showed comparable prevalence and severity of WMLs. However, men were significantly younger at time of WML assessment. Patients with classical FD had a higher chance on WMLs compared to non-classical patients. Progression of WMLs was seen in 24.6\% of patients (49 out of 199 patients) during 38.1 months follow-up. Progression was seen in both men and women, with and without enzyme replacement therapy, but at an earlier age in men. Stroke seemed to be related to WMLs, but cerebrovascular risk factors, cardiac and renal (dys)function did not. Pathology in the brain in FD seemed to extend beyond the WMLs into the normal appearing white matter. CONCLUSIONS: A significant group of FD patients has substantial WMLs and male patients develop WMLs earlier compared to female patients. WMLs could be used in clinical trials to evaluate possible treatment effects on the brain. Future studies should focus on longitudinal follow-up using modern imaging techniques, focusing on the clinical consequences of WMLs. In addition, ischemic and non-ischemic pathways resulting in WML development should be studied.},

	abstract = {The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the adjacent light-sensitive photoreceptors form a single functional unit lining the back of the eye. Both cell layers are essential for normal vision. RPE degeneration is usually followed by photoreceptor degeneration and vice versa. There are currently almost no effective therapies available for RPE disorders such as Stargardt disease, specific types of retinitis pigmentosa, and age-related macular degeneration. RPE replacement for these disorders, especially in later stages of the disease, may be one of the most promising future therapies. There is, however, no consensus regarding the optimal RPE source, delivery strategy, or the optimal experimental host in which to test RPE replacement therapy. Multiple RPE sources, delivery methods, and recipient animal models have been investigated, with variable results. So far, a systematic evaluation of the (variables influencing) efficacy of experimental RPE replacement parameters is lacking. Here we investigate the effect of RPE transplantation on vision and vision-based behavior in animal models of retinal degenerated diseases. In addition, we aim to explore the effect of RPE source used for transplantation, the method of intervention, and the animal model which is used. METHODS: In this study, we systematically identified all publications concerning transplantation of RPE in experimental animal models targeting the improvement of vision (e.g., outcome measurements related to the morphology or function of the eye). A variety of characteristics, such as species, gender, and age of the animals but also cell type, number of cells, and other intervention characteristics were extracted from all studies. A risk of bias analysis was performed as well. Subsequently, all references describing one of the following outcomes were analyzed in depth in this systematic review: a-, b-, and c-wave amplitudes, vision-based, thickness analyses based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) data, and transplant survival based on scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) data. Meta-analyses were performed on the a- and b-wave amplitudes from electroretinography (ERG) data as well as data from vision-based behavioral assays. RESULTS: original research articles met the inclusion criteria after two screening rounds. Overall, most studies were categorized as unclear regarding the risk of bias, because many experimental details were poorly reported. Twenty-three studies reporting one or more of the outcome measures of interest were eligible for either descriptive (thickness analyses based on OCT data; n = 2) or meta-analyses. RPE transplantation significantly increased ERG a-wave (Hedges' g 1.181 (0.471-1.892), n = 6) and b-wave (Hedges' g 1.734 (1.295-2.172), n = 42) amplitudes and improved vision-based behavior (Hedges' g 1.018 (0.826-1.209), n = 96). Subgroup analyses revealed a significantly increased effect of the use of young and adolescent animals compared to adult animals. Moreover, transplanting more cells (in the range of 10(5) versus in the range of 10(4)) resulted in a significantly increased effect on vision-based behavior as well. The origin of cells mattered as well. A significantly increased effect was found on vision-based behavior when using ARPE-19 and OpRegen(®) RPE. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review shows that RPE transplantation in animal models for retinal degeneration significantly increases a- and b- wave amplitudes and improves vision-related behavior. These effects appear to be more pronounced in young animals, when the number of transplanted cells is larger and when ARPE-19 and OpRegen(®) RPE cells are used. We further emphasize that there is an urgent need for improving the reporting and methodological quality of animal experiments, to make such studies more comparable.},

The potential for reinnervation of the ACL graft is one of the proposed advantages of remnant-preserving reconstruction. The aim of this review is to summarize advances in the basic science underpinning this function, alongside recent clinical studies, to define the current role for remnant-preservation.A comprehensive systematic review was performed using PubMed and Medline searches. Studies were analyzed with particular focus placed on the methodology used to either identify mechanoreceptors or test proprioception.Contemporary work, using immunohistological staining, has shown mechanoreceptors primarily within proximity to the bony attachments of the ACL (peripherally in the subsynovial layer). The number of these receptors has been shown to decrease rapidly, following rupture, with adhesion to the posterior cruciate ligament slowing this decline. Recent studies have shown proprioceptive deficits, in both the injured and contralateral knees, with the clinical relevance of findings limited by testing methodology and the small differences found. The advantages of remnant-preservation, seen primarily in animal studies, have not been shown in systematic reviews or meta-analysis of clinical studies.The potential for reinnervation of the graft is likely time-dependent and reliant on continued loading of the remnant. Therefore, current clinical use and future research should focus on preserving remnants within 6 months of injury that remain loaded by adherence to the posterior cruciate ligament. Subsequent testing should account for central neurological changes and focus on clinically relevant outcomes.},

This study sought to determine the pooled prevalence and proportion of triple mixed Plasmodium spp. infection compared with double mixed infection. METHODS: Articles from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched for cross-sectional studies of triple mixed infection by Plasmodium species and then were retrieved and extracted. The pooled proportion and prevalence of triple mixed infection by Plasmodium species were subjected to random-effects analysis. The secondary outcomes were differences in the pooled proportion between triple mixed infection and double mixed infection by Plasmodium species reported in the included studies. RESULTS: Of 5621 identified studies, triple mixed infection data were available for 35 records, including 601 patients from 22 countries. The overall pooled prevalence of triple mixed infection was 4\% (95\% Confidence Interval (CI) 3-5\%; I(2) = 92.5\%). The pooled proportion of triple mixed infection compared with double mixed infection was 12\% (95\% CI 9-18; I(2) = 91\%). Most of the included studies (29/35; 82.9\%) presented a lower proportion of triple mixed infection than double mixed infection. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the proportion of triple mixed infection was the highest in Oceania (23\%; 95\% CI 15-36\%) and Europe (21\%; 95\% CI 5-86\%), but the lowest in the USA (3\%; 95\% CI 2-4\%). Moreover, the proportion of triple mixed infection was higher in residents (20\%; 95\% CI 14-29\%) than in febrile patients (7\%; 95\% CI 4-13\%), when compared with the proportion of double mixed infection. Subgroup analysis of the age groups demonstrated that, compared with the proportion of double mixed infection, triple mixed infection was lower in patients aged ≤ 5 years (OR = 0.27; 95\% CI 0.13-0.56; I(2) = 31\%) and {\textgreater} 5 years (OR = 0.09; 95\% CI 0.04-0.25, I(2) = 78\%). CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggested that, in areas where triple mixed infection were endemic, PCR or molecular diagnosis for all residents in communities where malaria is submicroscopic can provide prevalence data and intervention measures, as well as prevent disease transmission and enhance malaria elimination efforts.},

The present study aims to systematically review reports on naturally acquired P. cynomolgi in humans, mosquitoes, and macaques to provide relevant data for pre-emptive surveillance and preparation in the event of an outbreak of zoonotic malaria in Southeast Asia. METHODS: The protocol of the systematic review was registered at PROSPERO with approval ID CRD42020203046. Three databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and MEDLINE) were searched for studies reporting the prevalence of P. cynomolgi infections in Southeast Asian countries between 1946 and 2020. The pooled prevalence or pooled proportion of P. cynomolgi parasitemia in humans, mosquitoes, and macaques was estimated using a random-effects model. Differences in the clinical characteristics of P. cynomolgi infections were also estimated using a random-effects model and presented as pooled odds ratios (ORs) or mean differences (MDs) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Thirteen studies reporting on the prevalence of naturally acquired P. cynomolgi in humans (3 studies, 21 cases), mosquitoes (3 studies, 28 cases), and macaques (7 studies, 334 cases) were included. The results demonstrated that the pooled proportion of naturally acquired P. cynomolgi in humans was 1\% (95\% CI, 0.1\%, I(2), 0\%), while the pooled proportion of P. cynomolgi infecting mosquitoes was 18\% (95\% CI, 10-26\%, I(2), 32.7\%). The pooled prevalence of naturally acquired P. cynomolgi in macaques was 47\% (95\% CI, 27-67\%, I(2), 98.3\%). Most of the cases of naturally acquired P. cynomolgi in humans were reported in Cambodia (62\%) and Malaysia (38\%), while cases of P. cynomolgi in macaques were reported in Malaysia (35.4\%), Singapore (23.2\%), Indonesia (17.3\%), Philippines (8.5\%), Laos (7.93\%), and Cambodia (7.65\%). Cases of P. cynomolgi in mosquitoes were reported in Vietnam (76.9\%) and Malaysia (23.1\%). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the occurrence of naturally acquired P. cynomolgi infection in humans, mosquitoes, and macaques. Further studies of P. cynomolgi in asymptomatic human cases in areas where vectors and natural hosts are endemic are extensively needed if human infections with P. cynomolgi do become public health problems.},

For healthcare, the topic is both concerning and tragically ironic as hospitals have substantial environmental footprints, which are now known to contribute to significant health problems that the system itself was designed to treat. The human medical field has been proactive in taking steps to reduce waste and carbon emissions by identifying best practices to minimize such impacts. Characterization of needs and gaps has been addressed through reviews of the literature regarding environmental sustainability in the context of human hospitals. Our objective was to replicate methods used in a recent review of environmental sustainability in human hospitals to summarize information available to clinical veterinarians. Two search algorithms were used across eight databases, however only three peer-reviewed opinion articles specific to veterinary medicine were identified. These papers included one on anesthesia and two on production animals. Interestingly, all articles were written by United Kingdom-based authors and none were specific to companion animal practice, the largest sector in the veterinary industry in the United States. Results of this review highlight need for research and communication that supports veterinary clinics in adopting more environmentally sustainable practices. Proposed starting points informed from research in other sectors, including five physical themes of energy efficiency, water, waste, sustainable procurement, and transportation, and human behavior changes on the individual, group, and organizational levels, are discussed. Additional work is needed to support veterinarians and other animal health professionals to practice medicine in a way that upholds the veterinary profession's oath to promote the health of animals, the public, and the environment we all share.},

PURPOSE: To perform a systematic review of basic science and animal studies to determine the effect of doxycycline treatment on the prevention of PTOA after ACL rupture/transection. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: A systematic review was performed by searching the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases to identify basic science and animal studies evaluating the effect of doxycycline treatment on the prevention of PTOA of the knee joint after ACL/cranial cruciate ligament (CCL) injury. The search phrase used was "doxycycline cruciate ligament." Inclusion criteria were basic science and animal studies evaluating the effect of oral administration of doxycycline in ACL/CCL-deficient animals with or without a control group. RESULTS: Seven studies met inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. Five studies were performed in dogs, 1 in rabbits, and 1 in mice. Overall, the effects of doxycycline treatment on the prevention of PTOA after ACL/CCL rupture/transection were mixed. In dogs, no significant effects of doxycycline treatment were found in terms of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, while a mouse study found significantly lower MMP-13 expression on the tibia in doxycycline-treated animals, suggesting that doxycycline may protect against proteoglycan loss and decrease osteoarthritis progression. Cartilage nitric oxide concentrations were lower in doxycycline-treated dogs compared with untreated dogs, suggesting decreased cartilage degradation among doxycycline-treated dogs, although there were no significant effects on cartilage stromelysin levels with no significant effects in terms of physiological remodeling or catabolism of cartilage. Bone formation or resorption was not found to be affected by doxycycline treatment. One study demonstrated a substantial beneficial effect of doxycycline on gross morphology of the medial femoral condyle. Doxycycline was found to conserve bone strain energy density and appeared to limit subchondral bone loss in 1 study. CONCLUSION: Based on the limited available animal studies, doxycycline appears to demonstrate some benefits in the prevention of PTOA after ACL/CCL rupture/transection. Additional studies are needed to further characterize the potential benefits, side effects, dosage, and duration of this treatment after ACL injury in human patients.},

	abstract = {Conservation of big cats (Panthera spp.), a taxonomic group including tigers, lions, jaguars, leopards and snow leopards, is a daunting challenge. As expanding human populations across Panthera range countries exacerbate competition for land and prey, conflicts between humans and big cats are inevitable. Through a systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature published from 1991 to 2014 and indexed in Web of Science and Google Scholar (186 articles), our study explored the current state of knowledge regarding human-Panthera conflict and potential solutions, examining variables such as spatial and temporal distribution of research, methods used to study conflict, evaluation of interventions, and management recommendations. Our synthesis revealed several key data gaps and research needs. More studies could utilize diverse data collection approaches to focus on both the ecological and socio-cultural context for conflict. Additionally, only 21\% of articles included in the review evaluated conflict mitigation interventions, and few of these yielded conclusive results. Success ratios suggest that compensation schemes and livestock management strategies were more effective tools for addressing conflict than either direct interventions (lethal removal or translocation of animals) or community interventions (e.g. education, ecotourism, local management). More studies should systematically evaluate the efficacy of conflict mitigation strategies, many of which are consistently recommended without empirical support. Results highlight trends and opportunities that can be used to inform future research and management efforts focused on human-Panthera conflict, ultimately enhancing the potential for coexistence between humans and carnivore species worldwide.},

	abstract = {Lentiviral replication mediated by reverse transcriptase is considered to be highly error prone, leading to a high intra-individual evolution rate that promotes evasion of neutralization and persistent infection. Understanding lentiviral intra-individual evolutionary dynamics on a comparative basis can therefore inform research strategies to aid in studies of pathogenesis, vaccine design, and therapeutic intervention. We conducted a systematic review of intra-individual evolution rates for three species groups of lentiviruses-feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Overall, intra-individual rate estimates differed by virus but not by host, gene, or viral strain. Lentiviral infections in spillover (nonadapted) hosts approximated infections in primary (adapted) hosts. Our review consistently documents that FIV evolution rates within individuals are significantly lower than the rates recorded for HIV and SIV. FIV intra-individual evolution rates were noted to be equivalent to FIV interindividual rates. These findings document inherent differences in the evolution of FIV relative to that of primate lentiviruses, which may signal intrinsic difference of reverse transcriptase between these viral species or different host-viral interactions. Analysis of lentiviral evolutionary selection pressures at the individual versus population level is valuable for understanding transmission dynamics and the emergence of virulent and avirulent strains and provides novel insight for approaches to interrupt lentiviral infections.IMPORTANCE To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that compares intra-individual evolution rates for FIV, SIV, and HIV following systematic review of the literature. Our findings have important implications for informing research strategies in the field of intra-individual virus dynamics for lentiviruses. We observed that FIV evolves more slowly than HIV and SIV at the intra-individual level and found that mutation rates may differ by gene sequence length but not by host, gene, strain, an experimental setting relative to a natural setting, or spillover host infection relative to primary host infection.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dog ownership has been associated with decreased cardiovascular risk. Recent reports have suggested an association of dog companionship with lower blood pressure levels, improved lipid profile, and diminished sympathetic responses to stress. However, it is unclear if dog ownership is associated with improved survival as previous studies have yielded inconsistent results. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association of dog ownership with all-cause mortality, with and without prior cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: Studies published between 1950 and May 24, 2019 were identified by searching Embase and PubMed. Observational studies that evaluated baseline dog ownership and subsequent all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality. Two independent reviewers extracted the data. We assessed pooled data using random-effects model. A possible limitation was that the analyses were not adjusted for confounders. Ten studies were included yielding data from 3 837 005 participants (530 515 events; mean follow-up 10.1 years). Dog ownership was associated with a 24\% risk reduction for all-cause mortality as compared to nonownership (relative risk, 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.67-0.86) with 6 studies demonstrating significant reduction in the risk of death. Notably, in individuals with prior coronary events, living in a home with a dog was associated with an even more pronounced risk reduction for all-cause mortality (relative risk, 0.35; 95\% CI, 0.17-0.69; I(2), 0\%). Moreover, when we restricted the analyses to studies evaluating cardiovascular mortality, dog ownership conferred a 31\% risk reduction for cardiovascular death (relative risk, 0.69; 95\% CI, 0.67-0.71; I(2), 5.1\%). CONCLUSIONS: Dog ownership is associated with lower risk of death over the long term, which is possibly driven by a reduction in cardiovascular mortality.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The present review sought to evaluate whether - and to what extent - targeting owners' behaviour is an effective way to reduce the problem of overweight and obesity among companion dogs. METHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases identified 14 studies that evaluated the effect of an intervention targeting owners' behaviour on (i) the owner's behaviour or (ii) the weight, (iii) body fat, or (iv) body condition of the dog. We coded aspects of the study design (e.g., the outcome variable), intervention (e.g., use of theory, specific behaviour change techniques or BCTs, inclusion of nutritional intervention alongside the behavioural intervention), and sample (e.g., age, gender, and weight of the dogs at baseline) that could influence the effect sizes. RESULTS: The interventions had, on average, a medium sized effect on outcomes (d(+) = 0.59, 95\% CI: 0.23 to 0.96, k = 14, N = 384). The effect sizes from the primary studies were relatively homogenous, Q(13) = 12.10, p =  .52 and the nature of the intervention, methodological and sample characteristics did not moderate the effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The findings of the review suggest that targeting owners' behaviour can be an effective way to reduce overweight and obesity among companion dogs. However, this conclusion is based on a limited number of studies and so we hope that the present findings serve as the impetus for further research in this area.},

Low-quality studies are at risk of biased results and effect overestimation, as has been intensely discussed for small animal stroke research. However, little is known about the methodological rigor and quality in large animal stroke models, which are becoming more frequently used in the field. Based on research in two databases, this systematic review surveys and analyses the methodological quality in large animal stroke research. Quality analysis was based on the Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable and the Animals in Research: Reporting In Vivo Experiments guidelines. Our analysis revealed that large animal models are utilized with similar shortcomings as small animal models. Moreover, translational benefits of large animal models may be limited due to lacking implementation of important quality criteria such as randomization, allocation concealment, and blinded assessment of outcome. On the other hand, an increase of study quality over time and a positive correlation between study quality and journal impact factor were identified. Based on the obtained findings, we derive recommendations for optimal study planning, conducting, and data analysis/reporting when using large animal stroke models to fully benefit from the translational advantages offered by these models.},

Based on systematic review of studies on Anaplasma species from India [35] and World [66] from 1988 to 2017 and 1978-2017, respectively, using online databases and offline literatures, meta-analysis using meta package in R-Software was done. Prevalence of Anaplasma species in India and World were 11\% [95\% level, Confidence Interval[CI] 7-16\%, Prediction Interval[PI] 1-69\%] and 39\% [95\% level, CI 30-49\%, PI 2-95\%], and these were obtained using 31,117 and 46,365 samples, respectively. Period-wise analysis revealed high Anaplasma species prevalence before 2011 for India and the World than from 2011 through 2017. Zone-wise prevalence indicated high prevalence in Central zone [61\%] and low in West and South zones [6\%] in India, and continent-wise, it was high in South America [82\%]. The studies used methods including blood smear examination, serology and nucleic acid-based techniques and revealed high prevalence in serology for India [34\%] and World [46\%], low prevalence by blood smear for India [7\%] and World [21\%], but higher sensitivity using nucleic acid-based techniques. Species-wise indicated higher prevalence in cattle [12\%] than buffaloes [2\%] in India. Prevalence was lower in India compared to the World and higher in South America. Overall, anaplasmosis causes low productivity in dairy animals and economic loss to dairy farmers. Hence, there is a need to control Anaplasma infections in high risk areas by adopting effective therapeutic and preventive measures so as to improve the economic benefits in dairy farming.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extracorporeal perfusion is a promising new technique for prolonged preservation of free flaps and extremities; however, uncertainties on perfusion settings and efficacy still exist. No overview of literature is currently available. This review systematically appraised available evidence comparing extracorporeal perfusion to static storage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An electronic systematic search was performed on June 12, 2016, in MEDLINE and EMBASE. Articles were included when evaluating the effect of extracorporeal perfusion of free flaps or extremities compared to that of a control group. Two independent researchers conducted the selection process, critical appraisal, and data extraction. RESULTS: Of 3485 articles screened, 18 articles were included for further analyzation. One article studied discarded human tissue; others were studies conducted on rats, pigs, or dogs. Perfusion periods varied from 1 h to 10 d; eight articles also described replantation. Risk of bias was generally scored high; none of the articles was excluded based on these scores. Tissue vitality showed overall better results in the perfused groups, more pronounced when perfusing over 6 h. The development of edema was a broadly described side effect of perfusion. CONCLUSIONS: Although tissue vitality outcomes seem to favor extracorporeal perfusion, this is difficult to objectify because of large heterogeneity and poor quality of the available evidence. Future research should focus on validating outcome measures, edema prevention, perfusion settings, and maximum perfusion time for safe replantation and be preferably performed on large animals to increase translation to clinical settings.},

Leveraging health information technology (HIT) may augment surveillance efforts for Chagas disease (CD), given its ability to disseminate information through health information exchanges (HIE) and geographical information systems (GISs). This systematic review seeks to determine whether technological tracking of Trypanosoma cruzi-infected domestic and/or sylvatic animals as sentinels can serve as a potential surveillance resource to manage CD in the southern United States. A Boolean search string was used in PubMed and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL). Relevance of results was established and analysis of articles was performed by multiple reviewers. The overall Cohen statistic was 0.73, demonstrating moderate agreement among the study team. Four major themes were derived for this systematic review (n = 41): animals act as reservoir hosts to perpetuate CD, transmission to humans could be dependent on cohabitation proximity, variations in T. cruzi genotypes could lead to different clinical manifestations, and leveraging technology to track T. cruzi in domestic animals could reveal prevalent areas or "danger zones." Overall, our systematic review identified that HIT can serve as a surveillance tool to manage CD. Health information technology can serve as a surveillance tool to manage CD. This can be accomplished by tracking domestic and/or sylvatic animals as sentinels within a GIS. Information can be disseminated through HIE for use by clinicians and public health officials to reach at-risk populations.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Food-derived bioactive peptides may influence important physiological functions. An important example is beta-casomorphins, which are opioid peptides derived from A1 beta-casein in bovine milk and have been associated to be risk factors for non-communicable diseases in humans. A1 and A2 beta-casein are different with respect to the release of bioactive peptides, in particular BCM-7. However, evidence from human studies is limited and could be complemented with evidence derived from animal studies. We conducted a scoping review to identify animal studies investigating the effects of A1 beta-casein or BCM-7 compared to A2 beta-casein or any other intervention on health-related outcomes. METHODS: We systematically searched for relevant studies in two electronic databases (Medline, Embase; last search performed March 2020). Two reviewers independently undertook study selection and data extraction of included references. Results were summarized tabularly and narratively. RESULTS: We included 42 studies investigating various animal models, including rats, mice, rabbits, and dogs. Six studies investigated health-related outcomes of A1- vs. A2 milk, while most studies (n = 36) reported on physiological properties (e.g., analgesic effect) of BCM-7 as an opioid peptide. Included studies were extremely heterogeneous in terms of the study population, type of intervention and dose, and type of outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: Only a few studies comparing the effects of A1- and A2 milk were identified. More studies addressing this research question in animal models are needed to provide essential information to inform research gaps. Results from future studies could eventually complement research for humans, particularly when the body of evidence remains uncertain as is the case in the A1- and A2 milk debate.},

	abstract = {Background: There is rapidly emerging interest in music interventions in healthcare. Music interventions are widely applicable, inexpensive, without side effects, and easy to use. It is not precisely known how they exert positive effects on health outcomes. Experimental studies in animal models might reveal more about the pathophysiological mechanisms of music interventions. Methods: We performed a systematic review of experimental research in rodents. The electronic databases EMBASE, Medline(ovidSP), Web-Of-Science, PsycINFO, Cinahl, PubMed publisher, Cochrane, and Google scholar were searched for publications between January 1st 1960 and April 22nd 2017. Eligible were English-written, full-text publications on experimental research in rodents comparing music vs. a control situation. Outcomes were categorized in four domains: brain structure and neuro-chemistry; behavior; immunology; and physiology. Additionally, an overview was generated representing the effects of various types of music on outcomes. Bias in studies was assessed with the SYRCLE Risk of Bias tool. A meta-analysis was not feasible due to heterogeneous outcomes and lack of original outcome data. Results: Forty-two studies were included. Music-exposed rodents showed statistically significant increases in neuro-chemistry, such as higher BDNF levels, as well as an enhanced propensity for neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. Furthermore, music exposure was linked with statistically significantly improved spatial and auditory learning, reduced anxiety-related behavior, and increased immune responses. Various statistically significant changes occurred in physiological parameters such as blood pressure and (para)sympathetic nerve activity following music interventions. The majority of studies investigated classical music interventions, but other types of music exerted positive effects on outcomes as well. The SYRCLE risk of bias assessment revealed unclear risk of bias in all studies. Conclusions: Music interventions seem to improve brain structure and neuro-chemistry; behavior; immunology; and physiology in rodents. Further research is necessary to explore and optimize the effect of music interventions, and to evaluate its effects in humans.},

	abstract = {Epilepsy is a serious neurological disorder affecting around 70 million people globally and is characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures. Recent evidence indicates that dysfunction in metabolic processes can lead to the alteration of neuronal and network excitability, thereby contributing to epileptogenesis. Developing a suitable animal model that can recapitulate all the clinical phenotypes of human metabolic epilepsy (ME) is crucial yet challenging. The specific environment of many symptoms as well as the primary state of the applicable neurobiology, genetics, and lack of valid biomarkers/diagnostic tests are the key factors that hinder the process of developing a suitable animal model. The present systematic review summarizes the current state of available animal models of metabolic dysfunction associated with epileptic disorders. A systematic search was performed by using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) model. A range of electronic databases, including google scholar, Springer, PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus, were scanned between January 2000 and April 2020. Based on the selection criteria, 23 eligible articles were chosen and are discussed in the current review. Critical analysis of the selected literature delineated several available approaches that have been modeled into metabolic epilepsy and pointed out several drawbacks associated with the currently available models. The result describes available models of metabolic dysfunction associated with epileptic disorder, such as mitochondrial respiration deficits, Lafora disease (LD) model-altered glycogen metabolism, causing epilepsy, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) deficiency, adiponectin responsive seizures, phospholipid dysfunction, glutaric aciduria, mitochondrial disorders, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) α-subunit gene (PDHA1), pyridoxine dependent epilepsy (PDE), BCL2-associated agonist of cell death (BAD), Kcna1 knock out (KO), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA) cancer susceptibility candidate 2 (lncRNA CASC2). Finally, the review highlights certain focus areas that may increase the possibilities of developing more suitable animal models and underscores the importance of the rationalization of animal models and evaluation methods for studying ME. The review also suggests the pressing need of developing precise robust animal models and evaluation methods for investigating ME.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the pathology and pathogenesis of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) in rodents. BACKGROUND: Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw occurs in patients taking antiresorptive drugs, such as bisphosphonates and denosumab, and anti-angiogenesis agents. However, there is limited information about the pathology of MRONJ at the clinical level. Moreover, no information about the exact mechanisms of MRONJ is clinically available. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PubMed, SCOPUS and Medline databases were used to search for relevant articles up to April 2018 by two independent reviewers. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. RESULTS: Of the 1841 studies, 10 articles met the eligibility criteria. The most commonly observed pathology of MRONJ-like lesions was exposed bone without epithelial coverage, decreases in the number of osteocytes and increases in necrotic bone with more empty lacunae. No definitive pathogenesis of MRONJ-like lesions was found. Both zoledronic acid (ZA) monotherapy and ZA/chemotherapeutic and/or dexamethasone combination therapy were significant high-risk factors for developing MRONJ-like lesions (P {\textless} 0.00001 and P {\textless} 0.0001, respectively). CONCLUSION: Based on rodent studies, common pathological findings were extracted in bisphosphonate-related ONJ (BRONJ)-like lesions, whereas no definitive pathogenesis was identified. There is no information about the pathology and pathogenesis of denosumab-related ONJ. These findings clearly suggest that accumulation of scientific evidence based on animal studies is absolutely necessary to explore the pathology and pathogenesis of MRONJ in humans. ZA administration would be a significant risk factor for developing BRONJ-like lesions.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12910-020-00465-7},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The burgeoning field of biomedical research involving the mixture of human and animal materials has attracted significant ethical controversy. Due to the many dimensions of potential ethical conflict involved in this type of research, and the wide variety of research projects under discussion, it is difficult to obtain an overview of the ethical debate. This paper attempts to remedy this by providing a systematic review of ethical reasons in academic publications on human-animal chimera research. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the ethical literature concerning human-animal chimeras based on the research question: "What ethical reasons have been given for or against conducting human-animal chimera research, and how have these reasons been treated in the ongoing debate?" Our search extends until the end of the year 2017, including MEDLINE, Embase, PhilPapers and EthxWeb databases, restricted to peer-reviewed journal publications in English. Papers containing ethical reasons were analyzed, and the reasons were coded according to whether they were endorsed, mentioned or rejected. RESULTS: Four hundred thirty-one articles were retrieved by our search, and 88 were ultimately included and analyzed. Within these articles, we found 464 passages containing reasons for and against conducting human-animal chimera research. We classified these reasons into five categories and, within these, identified 12 broad and 31 narrow reason types. 15\% of the retrieved passages contained reasons in favor of conducting chimera research (Category P), while 85\% of the passages contained reasons against it. The reasons against conducting chimera research fell into four further categories: reasons concerning the creation of a chimera (Category A), its treatment (Category B), reasons referring to metaphysical or social issues resulting from its existence (Category C) and to potential downstream effects of chimera research (Category D). A significant proportion of identified passages (46\%) fell under Category C. CONCLUSIONS: We hope that our results, in revealing the conceptual and argumentative structure of the debate and highlighting some its most notable tendencies and prominent positions, will facilitate continued discussion and provide a basis for the development of relevant policy and legislation.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Yew plant materials contain highly toxic taxine alkaloids. Serious ingestions can result in life-threatening toxicity. The purpose of this article is to summarize the literature on the treatment of acute yew poisoning. DATA SOURCES: PubMed (January 1946 to November 2017) was searched using the search terms "taxus/po". EMBASE (1980 to November 2017) was searched using the search terms "taxus/to" and "yew.mp." Web of Science (1945 to November 2017) was searched using the text words taxus, taxine, and yew. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Available English language articles involving case reports, epidemiology, treatment, and outcomes were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Although not uncommon, unintentional yew poisoning rarely results in significant morbidity or mortality. A total of 26 case reports of yew poisoning were evaluated along with 4 case series articles (totaling 22 additional cases). Only 4 of the 48 total cases (8\%) were accidental poisonings, the rest being deliberate ingestions. In 20 patients (42\%), it resulted in fatalities. Severe, acute yew poisoning results in symptomatology largely resistant to pharmacotherapy intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Most nonintentional ingestions of yew plant constituents are asymptomatic and require little intervention. Severe poisoning can result in life-threatening cardiac toxicity and require aggressive supportive care. Therapeutic interventions, such as sodium bicarbonate, digoxin immune fab, and hemodialysis that have been utilized in case studies and case series in the literature have little proven benefit. Extracorporeal life support should be considered in severe yew poisoning.},

	abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: The genus Polygala, the most representative genus of the Polygalaceae family, comprises more than 600 species from all over the world of which around 40 are distributed in China, some of them, being used in the Traditional Chinese Medicine system. AIM OF THE REVIEW: We intend to discuss the current knowledge about the traditional uses, and the newest phytochemical and pharmacological achievements with tentative elucidation of the mechanism of action on the genus Polygala covering the period 2013-2019 to provide a scientific support to the traditional uses, and to critically analyze the reported studies to obtain new insights for further researches. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data were systematically collected from the scientific electronic data bases including SciFinder, Scopus, Elsevier, PubMed and Google Scholar. RESULTS: This literature overview reported several traditional uses of different species of Polygala, mainly against wounds, inflammation, cardiovascular and central nervous system disorders. P. altomontana, P caudata, P. flavescens, P. glomerata, P. japonica, P. molluginifolia, P. sibirica, P. tenuifolia are the main species which have been studied in the last few years. Phytochemical studies showed that they contain triterpene saponins, triterpenes, terpenoids, xanthones, flavonoids, coumarins, oligosaccharide esters, styryl-pyrones, benzophenones, and polysaccharides. Pharmacological in vitro and in vivo studies and proposal of the mechanisms of action indicated that pure constituents and extracts of Polygala ssp exhibited significant anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, antiischemic, antidepressant, sedative, analgesic, antiatherosclerosis, antitumor and enzyme inhibitory properties. CONCLUSION: This review on traditional uses and phytopharmacological potential of the genus Polygala revealed updated insights which can be explored for further mechanism-based pharmacological activities and structure/activity relationships studies and a better comprehension of the development of Chinese medicine preparations. However some pharmacological studies showed several gaps such as incomplete methodologies and ambiguous findings. More high scientific quality preclinical studies with pharmacokinetic considerations will be required in the future to assess the traditional uses of some species of this genus. This might lead to efficacy and safety issues in clinical trials and to potential medicinal applications.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) lead to drastic metabolic alterations with associated energy balance and body weight changes, two related physiological processes regulated by the brain. Polyphenol-based treatments for NCDs have emerged as a promising therapy, which seems to involve the energy balance modulation. However, it remains unclear what the most effective polyphenols-based treatment is to attenuate adverse effects in the energy balance of NCDs. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the literature on the metabolic and neurological effects of polyphenols-based treatment in rodent models of NCDs. METHODS: Literature search was carried out in the following databases: CINAHL, Medline/PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science. For title and abstract screening, original papers with polyphenols exposure in rodents were selected. For full-text screening, studies with models of NCDs that reported metabolic and neurological outcomes when treated with polyphenols were selected for inclusion in this review. RESULTS: 23 articles, using individual compound (11 articles) or polyphenols extracts (12 articles), were included in this review: 5 articles using tea polyphenols, 12 articles using grape-derived polyphenols, 3 articles using the polyphenol quercetin, and 3 articles using other polyphenol sources. Most results agree on the beneficial effect of polyphenols in attenuating alterations in energy balance and body weight. Such effects were associated with neuroprotective responses in different brain areas including hippocampus and hypothalamus. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this review shows that the treatment with polyphenols, especially resveratrol or quercetin, attenuates the adverse effects of NCDs on energy balance and are associated with neuroprotective effects.},

Pigs are described as the main amplifying host, but their role in JE epidemiology needs to be reassessed in order to identify and implement efficient control strategies, for both human and animal health. We aimed to provide a systematic review of publications linked to JE in swine, in terms of both individual and population characteristics of JE virus (JEV) infection and circulation, as well as observed epidemiological patterns. We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement to select and analyze relevant articles from the Scopus database, 127 of which were included in the review. Pigs are central, but the implication of secondary hosts cannot be ruled out and should be further investigated. Although human vaccination cannot eradicate the virus, it is clearly the most important means of preventing human disease. However, a better understanding of the actual involvement of domestic pigs as well as other potential JEV hosts in different JEV epidemiological cycles and patterns could help to identify additional/complementary control measures, either by targeting pigs or not, and in some specific epidemiological contexts, contribute to reduce virus circulation and protect humans from JEV infection.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dementia is a chronic condition which progressively affects memory and other cognitive functions, social behaviour, and ability to carry out daily activities. To date, no treatment is clearly effective in preventing progression of the disease, and most treatments are symptomatic, often aiming to improve people's psychological symptoms or behaviours which are challenging for carers. A range of new therapeutic strategies has been evaluated in research, and the use of trained animals in therapy sessions, termed animal-assisted therapy (AAT), is receiving increasing attention. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of animal-assisted therapy for people with dementia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialised Register on 5 September 2019. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of major healthcare databases, trial registries, and grey literature sources. We also searched MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), CINAHL (EBSCOhost), ISI Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO's trial registry portal. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised trials, and randomised cross-over trials that compared AAT versus no AAT, AAT using live animals versus alternatives such as robots or toys, or AAT versus any other active intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data using the standard methods of Cochrane Dementia. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of the retrieved records. We expressed our results using mean difference (MD), standardised mean difference (SMD), and risk ratio (RR) with their 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) where appropriate. MAIN RESULTS: We included nine RCTs from 10 reports. All nine studies were conducted in Europe and the US. Six studies were parallel-group, individually randomised RCTs; one was a randomised cross-over trial; and two were cluster-RCTs that were possibly related where randomisation took place at the level of the day care and nursing home. We identified two ongoing trials from trial registries. There were three comparisons: AAT versus no AAT (standard care or various non-animal-related activities), AAT using live animals versus robotic animals, and AAT using live animals versus the use of a soft animal toy. The studies evaluated 305 participants with dementia. One study used horses and the remainder used dogs as the therapy animal. The duration of the intervention ranged from six weeks to six months, and the therapy sessions lasted between 10 and 90 minutes each, with a frequency ranging from one session every two weeks to two sessions per week. There was a wide variety of instruments used to measure the outcomes. All studies were at high risk of performance bias and unclear risk of selection bias. Our certainty about the results for all major outcomes was very low to moderate. Comparing AAT versus no AAT, participants who received AAT may be slightly less depressed after the intervention (MD -2.87, 95\% CI -5.24 to -0.50; 2 studies, 83 participants; low-certainty evidence), but they did not appear to have improved quality of life (MD 0.45, 95\% CI -1.28 to 2.18; 3 studies, 164 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There were no clear differences in all other major outcomes, including social functioning (MD -0.40, 95\% CI -3.41 to 2.61; 1 study, 58 participants; low-certainty evidence), problematic behaviour (SMD -0.34, 95\% CI -0.98 to 0.30; 3 studies, 142 participants; very-low-certainty evidence), agitation (SMD -0.39, 95\% CI -0.89 to 0.10; 3 studies, 143 participants; very-low-certainty evidence), activities of daily living (MD 4.65, 95\% CI -16.05 to 25.35; 1 study, 37 participants; low-certainty evidence), and self-care ability (MD 2.20, 95\% CI -1.23 to 5.63; 1 study, 58 participants; low-certainty evidence). There were no data on adverse events. Comparing AAT using live animals versus robotic animals, one study (68 participants) found mixed effects on social function, with longer duration of physical contact but shorter duration of talking in participants who received AAT using live animals versus robotic animals (median: 93 seconds with live versus 28 seconds with robotic for physical contact; 164 seconds with live versus 206 seconds with robotic for talk directed at a person; 263 seconds with live versus 307 seconds with robotic for talk in total). Another study showed no clear differences between groups in behaviour measured using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (MD -6.96, 95\% CI -14.58 to 0.66; 78 participants; low-certainty evidence) or quality of life (MD -2.42, 95\% CI -5.71 to 0.87; 78 participants; low-certainty evidence). There were no data on the other outcomes. Comparing AAT using live animals versus a soft toy cat, one study (64 participants) evaluated only social functioning, in the form of duration of contact and talking. The data were expressed as median and interquartile ranges. Duration of contact was slightly longer in participants in the AAT group and duration of talking slightly longer in those exposed to the toy cat. This was low-certainty evidence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found low-certainty evidence that AAT may slightly reduce depressive symptoms in people with dementia. We found no clear evidence that AAT affects other outcomes in this population, with our certainty in the evidence ranging from very-low to moderate depending on the outcome. We found no evidence on safety or effects on the animals. Therefore, clear conclusions cannot yet be drawn about the overall benefits and risks of AAT in people with dementia. Further well-conducted RCTs are needed to improve the certainty of the evidence. In view of the difficulty in achieving blinding of participants and personnel in such trials, future RCTs should work on blinding outcome assessors, document allocation methods clearly, and include major patient-important outcomes such as affect, emotional and social functioning, quality of life, adverse events, and outcomes for animals.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To appraise the available animal and human studies investigating low-intensity pulsed ultrasound stimulation (LIPUS) on tendon, ligament, and bone-soft tissue (B-ST) junction healing. METHODS: A systematic review of PUBMED, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library was performed for animal and human studies investigating the effects of LIPUS on tendon, ligament, and B-ST junction healing. The systematic search was performed using the key term "low intensity pulsed ultrasound" and any of the following: "tendon," "ligament," "tendon-bone," and "bone-tendon." Inclusion criteria consisted of (1) randomized controlled trials assessing the effect of LIPUS on bone, tendon, and soft tissue in animals or humans and (2) English-language articles. RESULTS: A total of 28 animal and 2 human studies met inclusion criteria. Animal studies utilized various models, including Achilles and patellar tendon transections, medial collateral ligament transections, and surgical repair of patellar tendon, rotator cuff tendon, and anterior cruciate ligament, to evaluate the effects of LIPUS. Animal studies demonstrated significantly improved collagen content and organization, bone formation, fibrocartilage remodeling, and mechanical strength with LIPUS treatment compared with controls. In human trials, LIPUS treatment of chronic tendinopathies did not improve clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In acute injury animal models, LIPUS augmented healing of acute tendon, ligament, and B-ST junction injuries through increased collagen content and organization; increased anti-inflammatory cellular signaling; and increased angiogenesis. However, in 2 human studies investigating chronic tendinopathy, LIPUS did not lead to superior outcomes compared with controls. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Animal models suggest that LIPUS may be a promising noninvasive treatment modality for accelerating patient recovery after acute tendon and ligament injuries, as well as after surgical repair of B-ST junction injuries, but this has not been demonstrated in human studies. Randomized clinical trials evaluating LIPUS for acute tendon and ligament injuries are warranted.},

	abstract = {Scientists have long predicted the impacts of climate-related infectious disease emergence. Yet, the combined effect of local socioeconomic and demographic factors and weather variation on child health is poorly understood. With a focus on childhood diarrhoea caused by the parasite Cryptosporidium spp., - an infection easily controlled by public health interventions but also strongly linked to environmental conditions through waterborne spread, we systematically review and empirically model the effects of local weather and flooding history, after controlling for seasonality, publication bias, access to improved sanitation, health resources and population density at a global scale. We examined 1588 papers on childhood cryptosporidiosis and identified 36 studies representing a range of geographic locations and climatic, environmental and socio-economic conditions. Local rainfall and population density were related with cryptosporidiosis across latitudes as shown by mixed effects, spatio-temporal models for equatorial, sub-tropical and temperate climates. In equatorial (0-20°) latitudes, the previous month's rainfall and population density were inversely related with childhood cryptosporidiosis with a significant random effect for flooding history. In tropical-subtropical (20-35°) latitudes, rainfall in December was inversely related with cryptosporidiosis, compared to rainfall in April (the wet season). In temperate latitudes ({\textgreater}35°), there was a significant negative association of reported disease with population density. This global empirical analysis indicates differential spatio-temporal patterns of childhood cryptosporidiosis in low, mid and high latitude regions. Models that couple weather conditions with demographic factors are needed to assess disease distributional shifts and risks due to environmental change. These results may provide impetus to develop environment-focused public health policies to manage disease risks associated with climate change for future generations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to conduct a systematic review of preclinical and clinical evidence to chart the successful trajectory of talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) from the bench to the clinic. DESIGN: This study was a systematic review. The primary outcome of interest was the efficacy of treatment, determined by complete response. Abstract and full-text selection as well as data extraction were done by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias in studies. SETTING: Embase, Embase Classic and OvidMedline were searched from inception until May 2016 to assess its development trajectory to approval in 2015. PARTICIPANTS: Preclinical and clinical controlled comparison studies, as well as observational studies. INTERVENTIONS: T-VEC for the treatment of any malignancy. RESULTS: 8852 records were screened and five preclinical (n=150 animals) and seven clinical studies (n=589 patients) were included. We saw large decreases in T-VEC's efficacy as studies moved from the laboratory to patients, and as studies became more methodologically rigorous. Preclinical studies reported complete regression rates up to 100\% for injected tumours and 80\% for contralateral tumours, while the highest degree of efficacy seen in the clinical setting was a 24\% complete response rate, with one study experiencing a complete response rate of 0\%. We were unable to reliably assess safety due to the lack of reporting, as well as the heterogeneity seen in adverse event definitions. All preclinical studies had high or unclear risk of bias, and all clinical studies were at a high risk of bias in at least one domain. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings illustrate that even successful biotherapeutics may not demonstrate a clear translational road map. This emphasises the need to consider increasing rigour and transparency along the translational pathway. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42016043541.},

We conducted a systematic literature review to assess the relation between AHC and anemia among women of reproductive age, school-aged children, and children aged {\textless}5 y in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We used a 2-stage screening process, in which 1 reviewer searched 4 databases (PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Global Health) with predetermined search terms for relevant articles. Two reviewers then independently screened studies using a priori exclusion criteria, yielding a total of 23 articles included in the final review. We evaluated evidence from observational studies assessing animal-dependent livelihoods and livestock ownership, and interventions that promoted livestock and fish production. We found little consistency in anemia outcomes across the several AHC exposures and population groups. Poultry production interventions had modest benefits on anemia among women and children, although whether these improvements were a result of increased ASF consumption, or a result of the combined treatment study design could not be determined. Observational studies identified chicken ownership, and no other livestock species, as a risk factor for anemia among young children. However, there was limited evidence to evaluate pathways underlying these associations. Studies tended to rely on self-reported fever and diarrhea to assess illness, and no study directly assessed linkages between AHC, pathogen burden, and anemia. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether AHC improves or worsens anemia among women and children in LMICs. Given the current interest in promoting animal production among low-income households, future studies with robust measures of livestock ownership, ASF consumption, pathogen burden, and anemia status are needed to understand the nuances of this complex and potentially contradictory relation.},

OBJECTIVE: Spinal cord injuries (SCIs) resulting in motor deficits can be devastating injuries resulting in millions of health care dollars spent per incident. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a potential class of drugs that could improve motor function after an SCI. This systematic review utilizes PRISMA guidelines to evaluate the effectiveness of NSAIDs for SCI. METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Embase, and Scopus were reviewed linking the keywords of "ibuprofen," "meloxicam," "naproxen," "ketorolac," "indomethacin," "celecoxib," "ATB-346," "NSAID," and "nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug" with "spinal." Results were reviewed for relevance and included if they met inclusion criteria. The SYRCLE checklist was used to assess sources of bias. RESULTS: A total of 2960 studies were identified in the PubMed/MEDLINE database using the above-mentioned search criteria. A total of 461 abstracts were reviewed in Scopus, 340 in CINAHL, 179 in PsycINFO, and 7632 in Embase. A total of 15 articles met the inclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: NSAIDs' effectiveness after SCI is largely determined by its ability to inhibit Rho-A. NSAIDs are a promising therapeutic option in acute SCI patients because they appear to decrease cord edema and inflammation, increase axonal sprouting, and improve motor function with minimal side effects. Studies are limited by heterogeneity, small sample size, and the use of animal models, which might not replicate the therapeutic effects in humans. There are no published human studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of these drugs after a traumatic cord injury. There is a need for well-designed prospective studies evaluating ibuprofen or indomethacin after adult spinal cord injuries.},

	abstract = {Inflammatory disorders like diabetes, systemic lupus erythematodes, inflammatory lung diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, but also rejection of transplanted organs and GvHD, form a major burden of disease. Current classes of immune suppressive drugs to treat these disorders are never curative and side effects are common. Therefore there is a need for new drugs with improved and more targeted modes of action. Potential candidates are the DNA methyl transferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine (Aza) and its derivative 5-aza 2'deoxycitidine (DAC). Aza and DAC have been tested in several pre-clinical in vivo studies. In order to obtain an overview of disorders for which Aza and/or DAC can be a potential treatment, and to find out where information is lacking, we systematically reviewed pre-clinical animal studies assessing Aza or DAC as a potential therapy for distinct inflammatory disorders. Also, study quality and risk of bias was systematically assessed. In the 35 identified studies, we show that both Aza and DAC do not only seem to be able to alleviate a number of inflammatory disorders, but also prevent solid organ rejection and GvHD in in vivo pre-clinical animal models. Aza/DAC are known to upregulate FOXP3, a master transcription factor for Treg, in vitro. Seventeen studies described the effect on Treg, of which 16 studies showed an increase in Treg. Increasing Treg therefore seems to be a common mechanism in preventing inflammatory disorders by Aza/DAC. We also found, however, that many essential methodological details were poorly reported leading to an unclear risk of bias. Therefore, reported effects might be an overestimation of the true effect.},

The objective of this study was therefore to systematically review the evidence on the boostability of rabies immunization to date. We included 36 studies, of which 19 studies were suitable for meta-analysis. Reduced antibody levels were found after intradermal primary schedules as compared to intramuscular schedules. However, responses after booster immunization were adequate for both routes. Although studies showed that antibody levels decline over time, adequate booster responses were still retained over long time intervals indicating that post-exposure treatment is effective without extra measures after long periods of time.},

	abstract = {This review assesses factors affecting fouling in conventional pens for slaughter pigs. Fouling of the pen happens when pigs change their excretory behaviour from occurring in the designated dunging area to the lying area. This can result in a lower hygiene, bad air quality, extra work for the farmer, disturbance of the pigs' resting behaviour and an increase in agonistic interactions. A systematic search was conducted and results narrowed down to 21 articles. Four factors were found to affect fouling directly: insufficient space allowance, the flooring design of the pen, the thermal climate and pigs' earlier experience. Further, these primary factors are affected by secondary factors such as the shape of the pen, the weight of the pigs and especially the heat balance of the pigs, which is affected by several tertiary factors including, for example, temperature, humidity and draught. Results indicate that the most important factor to control when trying to prevent fouling of a pen is the pen climate. An appropriate climate may be accomplished through floor cooling in the designated lying area, sprinklers above the designated dunging area and by ensuring a more optimal ambient temperature curve that also fits the weight of the pigs in different stages of the production. All in all, fouling of the pen in conventional slaughter pigs is a multifactorial problem, but it is important to focus on increasing the comfortability, and especially the climate, of the designated lying area.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Human cercarial dermatitis (HCD) is a water-borne zoonotic parasitic disease. Cercariae of the avian schistosomes of several genera are frequently recognized as the causative agent of HCD. Various studies have been performed regarding prevalence of bird schistosomes in different regions of the world. So far, no study has gathered and analyzed this data systematically. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis study was to determine the prevalence of avian schistosomes worldwide. METHODS: Data were extracted from six available databases for studies published from 1937 to 2017. Generally, 41 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were used for data extraction in this systematic review. Most of studies have been conducted on the family Anatidae. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of avian schistosomes was estimated to be 34.0\% (95\%CI, 28\%-41\%) around the world. Furthermore, results displayed that, Allobilharzia visceralis and Trichobilharzia spp. had the highest frequency and their prevalence in the birds was 50.0\% (95\% CI, 3.0\%-97.0\%) and 32.0\% (95\% CI, 21.0\%-0.36\%), respectively. The results showed that the prevalence of avian schistosomes was 43.0\% (95\% CI, 29\% - 56\%) in the US and 38.0\% (27.0\% -50.0\%) in Europe, which were higher than other continents, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of 34\% shows that the bird schistosomes are very common zoonotic worms among aquatic birds in the world. Also, this study shows the importance of avian schistosome research when facing animal and human health of the future.},

Of the 56 DAS identified, 41 were based on field testing, eight on experimental challenge studies and seven on both. Also, we adapted human and terrestrial-animal standards and guidelines for DAS structure for use in aquatic animal diagnostic research. Through this process, we identified and addressed important metrics for consideration at the design phase: study purpose, targeted disease state, selection of appropriate samples and specimens, laboratory analytical methods, statistical methods and data interpretation. These recommended design standards for DAS are presented as a checklist including risk-of-failure points and actions to mitigate bias at each critical step.

During DIC, platelets play an important role in the development of micro thrombosis, but changes in platelet function parameters and their association with development of DIC have not been established. The present systematic review investigated reported associations between platelet function (activation, aggregation, and adhesion) and DIC. We performed a literature search in Embase and PubMed, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. In total, 22 articles were included; 14 human studies, seven animal studies, and one with both human and animal subjects. Platelet activation markers were generally reported to be higher in both DIC patients and animals with DIC than healthy controls, and higher among patients with DIC than patients without DIC. Six human and six animal studies investigated platelet aggregation, which were overall reported to be lower in DIC than in non-DIC or in healthy controls in both human and animal studies. Platelet aggregation was deemed to be confounded by low platelet counts, which are known to affect platelet aggregation analyses even within the reference interval. In conclusion, platelet activation analyses showed promise in diagnosis of DIC, but semi-automatization and standardization are warranted before these can be implemented in daily clinical practice. Changes in platelet aggregation analyses during DIC remain inconclusive, and further studies including adjustment for low platelet count are needed to clarify the role of platelet aggregation in DIC.},

This study was conducted to estimate the pooled prevalence of VRE in food of animal origin worldwide, to assess the result heterogeneity, and to determine cumulative evidence and the trend of the prevalence over time. Relevant studies were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled prevalence of VRE in food of animal origin. Subgroup meta-analysis was used to assess the heterogeneity of the results. A cumulative meta-analysis and meta-regression were conducted to determine cumulative evidence and the trend of the prevalence of VRE in food of animal origin over time, respectively. Of the 1352 retrieved studies, 50 articles were included. The pooled prevalence of VRE in food of animal origin was 11.7\% (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] = 8.4 to 16.0). Subgroup meta-analyses showed a significant difference in the prevalence of VRE for two characteristics. First, for the source of food, the prevalence of VRE was highest in aquatic food (43.4\% [95\% CI = 28.4 to 59.7]) and lowest in dairy food (4.1\% [95\% CI = 1.7 to 9.8]). Second, for continents, the prevalence of VRE was highest in Africa (18.5\% [95\% CI = 12.8 to 26.1]) and lowest in North America (0.3\% [95\% CI = 0.1 to 1.1]). Cumulative evidence showed two distinct features in two different periods. The pooled prevalence of VRE rapidly decreased from 79.3\% in 1998 to 13.1\% in 2003; it has slightly fluctuated between 10.5\% and 20.5\% since 2004. The results of the meta-regression indicated that the prevalence gradually decreased over time. In conclusion, the estimate of overall VRE prevalence worldwide in food of animal origin was ∼12\%, indicating the burden of VRE contamination in food of animal origin.},

However, it remains unclear what PAW adds to the animal welfare literature and to what extent its ideas are new. Through a critical review of the PAW literature, we aim to separate different aspects of PAW and situate it in relation to the traditional animal welfare literature. We find that the core PAW literature is small (n = 10 papers) but links to wider areas of current research interest. The PAW literature is defined by four features: (1) positive emotions which is arguably the most widely acknowledged; (2) positive affective engagement which serves to functionally link positive emotions to goal-directed behavior; (3) quality of life which serves to situate PAW within the context of finding the right balance of positives over negatives; (4) happiness which brings a full life perspective to PAW. While the two first points are already part of welfare research going back decades, the two latter points could be linked to more recent research agendas concerning aggregation and how specific events may affect the ability of animals to make the best of their lives.},

	abstract = {Background Rabies is a fatal yet vaccine-preventable disease. In the last two decades, domestic dog populations have been shown to constitute the predominant reservoir of rabies in developing countries, causing 99\% of human rabies cases. Despite substantial control efforts, dog rabies is still widely endemic and is spreading across previously rabies-free areas. Developing a detailed understanding of dog rabies dynamics and the impact of vaccination is essential to optimize existing control strategies and developing new ones. In this scoping review, we aimed at disentangling the respective contributions of mathematical models and phylodynamic approaches to advancing the understanding of rabies dynamics and control in domestic dog populations. We also addressed the methodological limitations of both approaches and the remaining issues related to studying rabies spread and how this could be applied to rabies control. Methodology/principal findings We reviewed how mathematical modelling of disease dynamics and phylodynamics have been developed and used to characterize dog rabies dynamics and control. Through a detailed search of the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, we identified a total of n = 59 relevant studies using mathematical models (n = 30), phylodynamic inference (n = 22) and interdisciplinary approaches (n = 7). We found that despite often relying on scarce rabies epidemiological data, mathematical models investigated multiple aspects of rabies dynamics and control. These models confirmed the overwhelming efficacy of massive dog vaccination campaigns in all settings and unraveled the role of dog population structure and frequent introductions in dog rabies maintenance. Phylodynamic approaches successfully disentangled the evolutionary and environmental determinants of rabies dispersal and consistently reported support for the role of reintroduction events and human-mediated transportation over long distances in the maintenance of rabies in endemic areas. Potential biases in data collection still need to be properly accounted for in most of these analyses. Finally, interdisciplinary studies were determined to provide the most comprehensive assessments through hypothesis generation and testing. They also represent new avenues, especially concerning the reconstruction of local transmission chains or clusters through data integration. Conclusions/significance Despite advances in rabies knowledge, substantial uncertainty remains regarding the mechanisms of local spread, the role of wildlife in dog rabies maintenance, and the impact of community behavior on the efficacy of control strategies including vaccination of dogs. Future integrative approaches that use phylodynamic analyses and mechanistic models within a single framework could take full advantage of not only viral sequences but also additional epidemiological information as well as dog ecology data to refine our understanding of rabies spread and control. This would represent a significant improvement on past studies and a promising opportunity for canine rabies research in the frame of the One Health concept that aims to achieve better public health outcomes through cross-sector collaboration.},

One study examined the effects of vitamin B$_{\textrm{12}}$ interventions in NTDs in animal and in vitro models. Few prospective studies have been conducted to date to examine the role of vitamin B$_{\textrm{12}}$ in NTDs.

The search process was based on the selection of publications listed in the Pubmed-Medline database until April 2016 to identify studies evaluating the impact of short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides or oligofructose on glucose homeostasis. Twenty-nine trials were included in the systematic review and the meta-analysis was performed on twelve of these papers according to the inclusion criteria. Fasting blood concentrations of glucose and insulin were selected as pertinent criteria of glucose homeostasis for the meta-analysis. The consumption of fructo-oligosaccharides decreased fasting blood glycaemia levels, whatever the metabolic status (healthy, obese or diabetic) and diet (low-fat or high-fat) throughout the experiment. This reduction was linear with prebiotic dose (from 0 to 13\% of the feed). Fasting insulinaemia also decreased linearly with fructo-oligosaccharide supplementation but the reduction was only significant in rodents fed a low-fat diet. Potential underlying mechanisms include gut bacterial fermentation of fructo-oligosaccharides to short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and bacterial modulation of bile acids, both interacting with host metabolism. This systemic review, followed by the meta-analysis, provides evidence that fructo-oligosaccharide supplementation has a significant effect on glucose homeostasis whatever the health status and diet consumed by animals.},

	abstract = {The feeding of diets with greater energy content than that needed for body maintenance following mating is believed to reduce embryonic survival in pigs. In swine operations, therefore, feed intake is often restricted during the first and second week of pregnancy to reduce embryo mortality. There is thought to be a relationship between feeding diets that result in energy intake that is greater than that needed for body maintenance and embryonic death. This relationship is associated with lesser than typical progesterone (P4) concentrations when feeding diets with greater energy content due to increased hepatic clearance. There is no consensus, however, as to whether feeding should be restricted during early pregnancy to avert this possible detrimental effect. Thus, the aim of this systematic review is to assess the effect in sows and gilts of feeding diets with different energy contents post-mating on embryonic survival, evaluating when possible, the relationship of a greater energy intake and P4 concentrations on embryonic survival. An electronic search was conducted of the PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of science, and Scielo databases during June 2018. A total of 109 articles were retrieved, and of these, only 16 articles were selected after applying the selection criteria. There was no negative effect of a greater feed intake than that needed for body maintenance after breeding in 75\% of the experiments. Results from 35\% of the experiments indicated feeding early pregnant sows a diet with greater energy content than that needed for body maintenance resulted in augmented embryonic death. In 66.7\% of the experiments, in which there was assessment of P4 concentration, there was no negative effect of feeding after farrowing a diet with greater energy than that needed for body maintenance. In conclusion, it appears that restricted feed intake in early pregnancy is no longer relevant when there are modern prolific dam lines utilized in swine production enterprises because dietary energy of as great as 54 MJ ME/day had no detrimental effect on embryo survival.},

	abstract = {Meta-analytic methods were used to determine statistical relationships between metabolizable AA supplies and milk protein yield, milk protein percentage, and milk yield in lactating dairy cows. Sixty-three research publications (258 treatment means) were identified through a search of published literature using 3 search engines and met the criteria for inclusion in this meta-analysis. The Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS) version 6.5 was used to determine dietary nutrient parameters including metabolizable AA. Two approaches were used to analyze the data. First, mixed models were fitted to determine whether explanatory variables predicted responses. Each mixed model contained a global intercept, a random intercept for each experiment, and data were weighted by the inverse of the SEM squared. The second analysis approach used classical effect size meta-analytical evaluation of responses to treatment weighted by the inverse of the treatment variance and with a random effect of treatment nested within experiment. Regardless of the analytical approach, CNCPS-predicted metabolizable Met (g/d) was associated with milk protein percentage and yield. Milk yield was positively associated with CNCPS-predicted metabolizable His, Leu, Trp, Thr, and nonessential AA (g/d). Milk true protein yield was also associated with CNCPS-predicted metabolizable Leu (g/d). Predicted metabolizable Lysine (g/d) did not increase responses in production outcomes. However, mean metabolizable Lys supply was less than typically recommended and the change with treatment was minimal (157 vs. 162 g; 6.36 vs. 6.38\% metabolizable protein). Experiments based solely on Lys or Met interventions were excluded from the study database. It is possible that the inclusion of these experiments may have provided additional insight into the effect of these AA on responses. This meta-analysis supports other research indicating a positive effect of Met and His as co-limiting AA in dairy cows and suggests Leu, Trp, and Thr be given greater consideration in future research.},

	abstract = {Benefits of hormonal growth promotants (HGPs) include production efficiency, profit, and reduced environmental effects for beef cattle. Questions remain about effects of HGP on beef quality, particularly on measures of toughness such as Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF), tenderness, and other taste-panel attributes of beef. The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the effects of HGP on beef quality using the results of randomized controlled trials identified from 3 searched databases. Thirty-one experiments with 181 treatment comparisons were used to evaluate the effects of HGP on WBSF and sensory measures of beef quality. Experiments varied in design, used many different hormonal treatments and combinations, which were single or repeated, in different breeds and sex groups of cattle, with or without electrical stimulation, and with different lengths of time on feed and beef aging. The effects of multiple treatment comparisons in experiments were evaluated using robust regression models and compared to Knapp-Hartung and permutation meta-analytical methods. Increased WBSF was associated with HGP treatment. Use of multiple HGP implants was associated with an increase in WBSF of 0.248 kg (95\% CI = 0.203 to 0.292). Effects of a single implant only increased WBSF by 0.176 kg (95\% CI = 0.109 to 0.242). Aging of beef did not alter the association of HGP with increased WBSF (P = 0.105); however, the point direction was toward a reduced effect with aging (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.005 per day aged). While aging lowered WBSF, it did not reduce the SMD between HGP treatment and reference groups. Comparisons using trenbolone acetate did not differ in WBSF from those using other implants (P {\textgreater} 0.15). The findings on sensory panel tenderness differ from those using WBSF as HGP treatment was not associated with reduced tenderness (P {\textgreater} 0.3) and multiple HGP treatments improved tenderness (SMD = 0.468) compared to a single implant. Further, juiciness, flavor, and connective tissue were not associated with HGP use, whereas there was a marked 5.5-point decrease in the Meat Standards Australia meat quality 4 score, albeit with limited experiments. In general, the true variance of experiments, tau2 (τ2) was low ({\textless}0.1), but heterogeneity, I2 was high ({\textgreater}50\%) indicating that much of the variance was due to factors other than measurement error. More targeted studies on the role of HGP in influencing beef quality are needed.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the potential benefits of antioxidant enrichment of semen extenders. These substances are used to combat oxidative stress during processing and conservation of rooster semen. A literature search was performed in June 2020 using the keywords rooster AND (semen OR spermatozoa OR sperm OR ejaculate OR ejaculation). This report followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. The PICO (population intervention comparison outcome) question was defined to compare roosters (Population) which had added antioxidants in the semen (Intervention) compared to the no-antioxidant group (Control); the outcome was semen quality (Outcome). Only articles investigating rooster cooled or frozen enriched semen with antioxidant extenders (Gallus Gallus domesticus) were selected by reading the title and abstract, totalizing 38 articles. After full text reading, we found that only 13 studies carried out sperm characteristics and fertility assays. To assess article quality, 15 items related to rooster breeding conditions, seminal collection methodology, and analyzed variables (seminal characteristics and fertility test) were established. There were positive effects of antioxidants on the preservation of seminal characteristics (motility, viability, membrane integrity, antioxidant activity, and lipid peroxidation) and on semen fertility after the conservation process. We conclude that the antioxidants reduce the oxidative stress and improve fertilizing capacity. The most used substances for cooled semen are glutathione, CoQ10, and l-carnitine; whereas for frozen semen, resveratrol, lycopene, and quercitin are most frequently used.},

	abstract = {Air pollution is a global health concern. Particulate matter (PM)(2.5), a component of ambient air pollution, has been identified by the World Health Organization as one of the pollutants that poses the greatest threat to public health. Cardiovascular health effects have been extensively documented, and these effects are still being researched to provide an overview of recent literature regarding air pollution-associated cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in humans. Additionally, potential mechanisms through which air pollutants affect the cardiovascular system are discussed based on human and additional animal studies. We used the strategy of a narrative review to summarize the scientific literature of studies that were published in the past 7 yr. Searches were carried out on PubMed and Web of Science using predefined search queries. We obtained an initial set of 800 publications that were filtered to 78 publications that were relevant to include in this review. Analysis of the literature showed significant associations between air pollution, especially PM(2.5), and the risk of elevated blood pressure (BP), acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac arrhythmia, and heart failure (HF). Prominent mechanisms that underlie the adverse effects of air pollution include oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, autonomic imbalance, and thrombogenicity. The current review underscores the relevance of air pollution as a global health concern that affects cardiovascular health. More rigorous standards are needed to reduce the cardiovascular disease burden imposed by air pollution. Continued research on the health impact of air pollution is needed to provide further insight.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study aimed to examine radiologic microarchitectural changes in the mandibles of ovariectomized (OVX) rats through a systematic review and meta-analysis and to identify factors of the OVX rat model that influence on the bone microstructure. METHODS: Eligible articles were identified by searching electronic databases, including Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and KoreaMed, for articles published from January 1966 to November 2017. Two reviewers independently performed study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95\% confidence intervals was calculated using a random-effects model. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were performed to explore the effect of potential sources on the outcomes. The reliability of the results was assessed by sensitivity analysis and publication bias. RESULTS: Of 1160 studies, 16 studies (120 OVX and 120 control rats) were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to the control group, the OVX rats' trabecular bone volume fraction (SMD = - 2.41, P {\textless} 0.01, I(2) = 81\%), trabecular thickness (SMD = - 1.73, P {\textless} 0.01, I(2) = 73\%) and bone mineral density (SMD = - 0.95, P = 0.01, I(2) = 71\%) displayed the bone loss consistent with osteoporosis. The trabecular separation (SMD = 1.66, P {\textless} 0.01, I(2) = 51\%) has widen in the OVX mandibular bone in comparison to the control group. However, the trabecular number showed no indication to detect the osteoporosis (SMD = - 0.45, P = 0.38, I(2) = 76\%). The meta-regression indicated that longer post-OVX periods led to greater changes in bone mineral density (β = - 0.104, P = 0.017). However, the rats' age at OVX was not linked to bone microstructure change. CONCLUSIONS: Using meta-regression and sensitivity analysis techniques, heterogeneity across the micro CT studies of OVX-induced osteoporosis was found. The major factors of heterogeneity were the region of interest and post-OVX period. Our assessment can assist in designing experiments to maximize the usefulness of OVX rat model.},

	abstract = {Multiple studies have suggested that ω-3 fatty acid intake may have a protective effect on cancer risk; however, its true association with cancer risk remains controversial. We performed an umbrella review of meta-analyses to summarize and evaluate the evidence for the association between ω-3 fatty acid intake and cancer outcomes. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from inception to December 1, 2018. We included meta-analyses of observational studies that examined associations between intake of fish or ω-3 fatty acid and cancer risk (gastrointestinal, liver, breast, gynecologic, prostate, brain, lung, and skin) and determined the level of evidence of associations. In addition, we appraised the quality of the evidence of significant meta-analyses by using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. We initially screened 598 articles, and 15 articles, including 57 meta-analyses, were eligible. Among 57 meta-analyses, 15 reported statistically significant results. We found that 12 meta-analyses showed weak evidence of an association between ω-3 fatty acid intake and risk of the following types of cancer: liver cancer (n = 4 of 6), breast cancer (n = 3 of 14), prostate cancer (n = 3 of 11), and brain tumor (n = 2 of 2). In the other 3 meta-analyses, studies of endometrial cancer and skin cancer, there were no assessable data for determining the evidence levels. No meta-analysis showed convincing, highly suggestive, or suggestive evidence of an association. In the sensitivity analysis of meta-analyses by study design, we found weak associations between ω-3 fatty acid intake and breast cancer risk in cohort studies, but no statistically significant association in case-control studies. However, the opposite results were found in case of brain tumor risk. Although ω-3 fatty acids have been studied in several meta-analyses with regard to a wide range of cancer outcomes, only weak associations were identified in some cancer types, with several limitations. Considering the nonsignificant or weak evidence level, clinicians and researchers should cautiously interpret reported associations between ω-3 fatty acid consumption and cancer risks.},

Studies of dairy foods and the risk of the MetS and its components published up to June 2016 were searched using PubMed, EMBASE and a reference search. Random-effects models were used to estimate the pooled relative risks (RR) with 95 \% CI. Finally, ten cross-sectional studies, two nested case-control studies and twenty-nine cohort studies were included for the analysis. In a dose-response analysis of cohort studies and cross-sectional studies, the pooled RR of the MetS for a one-serving/d increment of total dairy food (nine studies) and milk (six studies) consumption (200 g/d) were 0·91 (95 \% CI 0·85, 0·96) and 0·87 (95 \% CI 0·79, 0·95), respectively. The pooled RR of the MetS for yogurt (three studies) consumption (100 g/d) was 0·82 (95 \% CI 0·73, 0·91). Total dairy food consumption was associated with lower risk of MetS components, such as hyperglycaemia, elevated blood pressure, hypertriacylglycerolaemia and low HDL- cholesterol. A one-serving/d increment of milk was related to a 12 \% lower risk of abdominal obesity, and a one-serving/d increment of yogurt was associated with a 16 \% lower risk of hyperglycaemia. These associations were not significantly different by study design, study location or adjustment factors. This meta-analysis showed that specific types of dairy food consumption such as milk and yogurt as well as total dairy food consumption were inversely related to risk of the MetS and its components.},

	abstract = {High ambient temperature (AT) is a major constraint on efficiency of farming in pig production. Results of reported studies assessing the influences of high AT on pig performance are highly variable, particularly in pigs with different body weight (BW). Therefore, a meta-analysis from ISI Web of Science and PubMed was operated to explain variations of average daily feed intake (ADFI) and average daily gain (ADG) in the reports across literatures during high AT in growing or finishing pigs. Pigs were divided to three BW categories as LOW (46 to 65 kg), MED (65{\textless} to 85 kg), and HGH (85{\textless} kg). The significant effect of AT on ADG were observed in LOW, MED, and HGH categories. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) for multiple linear regression shows significance of linear relationships between both ADG and ADFI, and AT and BW as: ADG$_{\textrm{LOW}}$=1260-19.9*AT+2.09*BW, ADG$_{\textrm{MED}}$=1546-22.5*AT-0.88*W, ADG$_{\textrm{HGH}}$=1893-31.9*AT-2.40*BW, ADFI$_{\textrm{LOW}}$=1756-35.0*AT+24.6*BW, ADFI$_{\textrm{MED}}$=2793-49.6*AT+12.5*BW, and ADFI$_{\textrm{HGH}}$=4172-59.0*AT+0.74*BW. The significant effect of temperature on gain to feed ratio (G:F) was observed in LOW and HGH categories. The ANOVA for multiple regression revealed evidence on high significance of linear relationships between G:F and AT: G:F$_{\textrm{LOW}}$=0.80+0.02*AT+0.02*BW, G:F$_{\textrm{MED}}$=0.95+0.02*AT+0.02*BW, and G:F$_{\textrm{HGH}}$=0.78+0.05*AT+0.01*BW. The overall results of mixed model analysis show that the significant interaction between BW and AT means that pigs in heavier category have lower G:F when temperature increases.

	abstract = {Despite many recent advances in imaging and epidemiological data analysis, musculoskeletal injuries continue to be a welfare issue in racehorses. Peptide biomarker studies have failed to consistently predict bone injury. Molecular profiling studies provide an opportunity to study equine musculoskeletal disease. A systematic review of the literature was performed using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines to assess the use of miRNA profiling studies in equine and human musculoskeletal injuries. Data were extracted from 40 papers between 2008 and 2020. Three miRNA studies profiling equine musculoskeletal disease were identified, none of which related to equine stress fractures. Eleven papers studied miRNA profiles in osteoporotic human patients with fractures, but differentially expressed miRNAs were not consistent between studies. MicroRNA target prediction programmes also produced conflicting results between studies. Exercise affected miRNA profiles in both horse and human studies (e.g., miR-21 was upregulated by endurance exercise and miR-125b was downregulated by exercise). MicroRNA profiling studies in horses continue to emerge, but as yet, no miRNA profile can reliably predict the occurrence of fractures. It is very important that future studies are well designed to mitigate the effects of variation in sample size, exercise and normalisation methods.},

	abstract = {Maternal undernutrition during pregnancy is prevalent across the globe, and the origins of many chronic diseases can be traced back to in utero conditions. This systematic review considers the current evidence in animal models regarding the relationship between maternal global nutrient restriction during pregnancy and offspring kidney structure and function. CINAHL, Cochrane, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Scopus were searched to November 2017. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines were followed, and articles were screened by two independent reviewers. Twenty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria: 16 studies were on rats, 9 on sheep, 2 on baboons, and 1 on goats. The majority of the rat studies had maternal global nutrient restriction during pregnancy at 50\% of ad libitum while restriction for sheep and baboon studies ranged from 50\% to 75\%. Because of the heterogeneity of outcome measures and the large variation in the age of offspring at followup, no meta-analysis was possible. Common outcome measures included kidney weight, nephron number, glomerular size, glomerular filtration rate, and creatinine clearance. To date, there have been no studies assessing kidney function in large animal models. Most studies were rated as having a high or unknown risk of bias. The current body of evidence in animals suggests that exposure to maternal global nutrient restriction during pregnancy has detrimental effects on offspring kidney structure and function, such as lower kidney weight, lower nephron endowment, larger glomerular size, and lower glomerular filtration rate. Further long-term followup of studies in large animal models investigating kidney function through to adulthood are warranted.},

This paper describes a systematic review of methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis, comparing trial design between 147 animal and 512 human studies. Animal studies generally included fewer subjects than human studies, and less frequently reported randomisation and blinding. In relation to life span, study duration was comparable for animals and humans, but included animals were younger than included humans. Animal studies often comprised males only (61\%), human studies always included females (98\% included both sexes). Power calculations were poorly reported in both samples. Analyses of human studies more frequently comprised Chi-square tests, those of animal studies more frequently reported analyses of variance. Administration route was more variable, and more frequently reported in animal than human studies. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and c-reactive protein were analysed more frequently in human than in animal studies. To conclude, experimental designs for animal and human studies are not optimally aligned. However, methotrexate is effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis in animal models and humans. Further evaluation of the available evidence in other research fields is needed to increase the understanding of translational success before we can optimise translational strategies.},

A total of 636 publications were identified describing genetic animal models for CF in mice, pigs, ferrets, rats and zebrafish. Most of these models have an altered Cftr gene. An overview of basic model characteristics and outcome measures for these genetic models is provided, together with advice on using these data. As far as the authors are aware, this is one of the largest systematic mapping reviews on genetic animal models for CF. It can aid in selecting a suitable model and outcome measures.

	doi = {10.1186/s12967-019-1976-2},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Drug development is currently hampered by high attrition rates; many developed treatments fail during clinical testing. Part of the attrition may be due to low animal-to-human translational success rates; so-called "translational failure". As far as we know, no systematic overview of published translational success rates exists. SYSTEMATIC SCOPING REVIEW: The following research question was examined: "What is the observed range of the animal-to-human translational success (and failure) rates within the currently available empirical evidence?". We searched PubMed and Embase on 16 October 2017. We included reviews and all other types of "umbrella"-studies of meta-data quantitatively comparing the translational results of studies including at least two species with one being human. We supplemented our database searches with additional strategies. All abstracts and full-text papers were screened by two independent reviewers. Our scoping review comprises 121 references, with various units of measurement: compound or intervention (k = 104), study/experiment (k = 10), and symptom or event (k = 7). Diagnostic statistics corresponded with binary and continuous definitions of successful translation. Binary definitions comprise percentages below twofold error, percentages accurately predicted, and predictive values. Quantitative definitions comprise correlation/regression (r(2)) and meta-analyses (percentage overlap of 95\% confidence intervals). Translational success rates ranged from 0 to 100\%. CONCLUSION: The wide range of translational success rates observed in our study might indicate that translational success is unpredictable; i.e. it might be unclear upfront if the results of primary animal studies will contribute to translational knowledge. However, the risk of bias of the included studies was high, and much of the included evidence is old, while newer models have become available. Therefore, the reliability of the cumulative evidence from current papers on this topic is insufficient. Further in-depth "umbrella"-studies of translational success rates are still warranted. These are needed to evaluate the probabilistic evidence for predictivity of animal studies for the human situation more reliably, and to determine which factors affect this process.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pollination services provided by solitary bees, the largest group of bees worldwide, are critical to the vitality of ecosystems and agricultural systems alike. Disconcertingly, bee populations are in decline, and while no single causative factor has been identified, pesticides are believed to play a role in downward population trends. The effects of pesticides on solitary bee species have not been previously systematically cataloged and reviewed. OBJECTIVES: This systematic scoping review examines available evidence for effects of pesticide exposure on solitary bees to identify data gaps and priority research needs. METHODS: A systematic literature search strategy was developed to identify and document reports on solitary bee pesticide exposure-effects investigations. Literature was subsequently screened for relevance using a Population, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) statement and organized into a systematic evidence map. Investigations were organized by effect category (lethal effects on immatures, lethal effects on adults, sublethal effects on immatures, and sublethal effects on adults), species, pesticide class, and publication year. RESULTS: A comprehensive literature search of Web of Science and ProQuest Agricultural \& Environmental Science supplemented by targeted internet searching and reference mining yielded 176 reports and publications for title and abstract screening and 65 that met PECO criteria (22 included lethal and 43 included sublethal effects endpoints). Relevant design details (pesticide, test compound configuration, study type, species, sex, exposure duration) were extracted into literature inventory tables to reveal the extent endpoints have been investigated and areas in need of additional research. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence mapping revealed diversity in the pesticides and endpoints studied across the database. However, dilution across bee species, lack of complementary laboratory work and paucity of replicated investigations complicate efforts to interpret and apply available data to support pesticide risk assessment.},

METHODS: We selected and analyzed observational studies that discussed the relationships between fresh and processed fish intake on glioma risk from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the SinoMed and Wanfang databases from inception to 31 March 2020. Studies were selected according to pre-established eligibility criteria and data were extracted separately by two researchers. A meta-analysis was conducted based on a random-effects model to provide pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Eight studies considered the relationship between fish intake (seven fresh and seven processed fish) and glioma risk and were included in this meta-analysis. The OR effect size for fresh fish intake and glioma risk was 0.72 (95\%CI 0.53-0.97) and the overall OR effect size for processed fish intake and glioma risk was 1.88 (95\%CI 1.06-3.34). CONCLUSION: Dietary intake of fresh fish may reduce the risk of glioma, but consumption of processed fish may increase the risk of glioma. This study had some limitations, and further studies are therefore required to clarify the associations between fish intake and glioma risk.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.prevetmed.2018.09.016},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Overuse of antimicrobials in both humans and animals is recognized as one of the main drivers of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR); and the optimisation of their use has been advocated as a key strategy for dealing with AMR. The measurement of antimicrobial use is vital for the design, monitoring and evaluation of such strategies. This systematic review describes and compares methods and measurements used to quantify antimicrobial use in pigs in order to inform efforts to standardize measurement. METHODS: The peer-reviewed literature was systematically searched using four online databases: MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Scopus and Web of Science. Eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review included: articles published in English, involving pigs of any age and types of production, providing quantitative data on antimicrobial use, containing a clear description of the methodology, and having moderate to high rank in the quality assessment. RESULTS: Of 2,362 abstracts reviewed, a total of 25 studies were included based on the eligibility criteria. All studies were published between 2001 and 2017. Twenty of the studies were conducted in eight European countries. Twelve studies estimated antimicrobial use and eight studies were primarily methodological papers comparing different methods or variables, or developing new methods. The two main sources of antimicrobial use data were farm surveys and national sales data. A large variety of units of measurement was found. In this review, the ten measurements identified were categorized into four groups: 1) antimicrobials use measured by milligrams of active substance per animal weight; 2) antimicrobials use measured by daily dose per weight at treatment; 3) antimicrobial use measured by daily dose per treatment period; and 4) antimicrobials use measured by daily dose per period at risk of treatment. CONCLUSION: There is no global standardized measurement of antimicrobial use in pigs. Given the importance of monitoring the use antimicrobials, we recommend that at a minimum, all countries should develop macro-level monitoring using national sales data and report use by milligram of active ingredients per Population Correcting Unit. Monitoring in specific animal species requires the development of systems to capture prescription at national or farm level. Findings from monitoring antimicrobial use may help to guide effective interventions for optimising use of antimicrobials, as recommended by the WHO Global Action Plan on AMR.},

Thirty-six articles were identified and reviewed, of which more than 85\% of studies were conducted in Europe and North America. Penicillins and Tetracyclines groups were the most commonly used antibiotics in many countries. Oral medication in suckling and post-weaning periods were the most common applications of antibiotic administration in pig production. Antibiotic use is driven by age-specific diseases and the common pathogens causing these conditions where epidemiological profiles varied greatly across countries. In addition, the type and size of farm were associated with antibiotic use with finisher and larger farms using more antibiotics than farrow-to-finish and smaller farms. There is variation in the use of the highest priority critically important antimicrobials in humans across studies. However, this review indicates that they are still commonly used in pig production, for treatment and prevention of infection. This evidence calls for global efforts on the prudent use of antibiotics in response to the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the agricultural sector.},

The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate whether the application of laser therapy improved alveolar healing after tooth extractions. Eight electronic databases were screened: MedLine (PubMed), The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, Lilacs, Ibecs, Scielo, and BBO. Three reviewers independently assessed the title and abstracts of potentially relevant studies. Only clinical trials and animal experiments that evaluated the wound healing effect of laser therapy after tooth extraction were included. A total of 16 studies fulfilled all criteria, thus 8 animal experiments and 8 clinical trials were included. Different types of laser were evaluated, such as CO(2) , GaAlAs, Nd:YAG, Diode Laser, HeNe, and High-frequency Pulsed Diode Laser. Although HF, Diode and GaAs lasers were able to enhance wound healing process in clinical studies, four trials and one animal experiment showed no improvement in wound healing with laser therapy after tooth extractions. In general, the current available evidence in the literature showed that laser therapy improved the wound healing process, but these findings were limited to the type of laser applied and its specific settings. Further well-designed and randomized controlled trials are needed to support a benefit effect of using laser therapy after tooth extraction. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42014007509 (2014).},

In total, eight articles from six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met the eligibility criteria and were included in this systematic review. The results of the meta-analysis showed a statistically significant decrease in behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), especially agitation and depression, in people with dementia who were treated with PRI. Both individual and group format PRI significantly ameliorated BPSD. However, there were no significant improvements in cognitive function or quality of life. The results of the meta-analysis suggest that PRI may be suitable as a treatment option for BPSD in people with dementia and should be considered as a useful tool in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains the most common complication of extreme prematurity as no effective treatment is available to date. This calls for the exploration of new therapeutic options like cell therapy, which is already effective for various human (lung) disorders. We systematically searched the MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases from the earliest date till January 2017 and included original studies on the perinatal use of cell-based therapies (i.e. cells and/or cell-derivatives) to treat BDP in animal models. Fourth publications describing 47 interventions were retrieved. Newborn mice/rats raised in a hyperoxic environment were studied in most interventions. Different cell types - either intact cells or their conditioned medium - were administered, but bone marrow and umbilical cord blood derived mesenchymal stem cells were most prevalent. All studies reported positive effects on outcome parameters including alveolar and vascular morphometry, lung function, and inflammation. Cell homing to the lungs was demonstrated in some studies, but the therapeutic effects seemed to be mostly mediated via paracrine modulation of inflammation, fibrosis and angiogenesis. CONCLUSION: Multiple rat/mouse studies show promise for cell therapy for BPD. Yet careful study of action mechanisms and side effects in large animal models is imperative before clinical translation can be achieved.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: It is unclear if direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are effective and safe alternatives to low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWHs) for the treatment of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE). We aim to synthesize existing literature that compared DOACs versus LMWHs in this high-risk population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using EMBASE, MEDLINE and CENTRAL for all observational studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (PROSPERO: CRD42017080898). Two authors independently reviewed study eligibility, extracted data, and assessed bias. Primary outcomes included 6-month recurrent VTE and major bleeding. Secondary outcomes included clinically relevant non-major bleeding (CRNMB) and mortality. RESULTS: We screened 426 articles, reviewed 25 in full-text, and selected 13 and 2 for qualitative and quantitative synthesis, respectively. Based on a meta-analysis of the 2 RCTs, DOACs had lower 6-month recurrent VTE (42/725) when compared to LMWH (64/727) (RR: 0.65 (0.42-1.01)). However, DOACs had higher major bleeding (40/725) when compared to LMWH (23/727) (RR 1.74 (1.05-2.88)). Similarly, CRNMB was higher (RR 2.31 (0.85-6.28)) for patients receiving DOACs. There was no difference in mortality (RR 1.03 (0.85-1.26)). Observational studies were heterogeneous with high risks of bias but showed recurrent VTE rates consistent with the meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: DOACs were more effective than LMWHs to prevent recurrent VTE but were associated with a significantly increased risk of major bleeding as well as a trend toward more CRNMB. The absolute risk differences were small (2-3\%) for both primary outcomes and may reflect better compliance with DOACs than LMWHs.},

The PubMed,EMbase,Web of Science,CBM,CNKI and Wan Fang Databases from their establishment to August 31 th,2018 were searched. Two independent reviewers screened the papers,extracted the data,assessed the risk of bias using SYRCLE assessment tool and conducted Meta-analysis with Rev Man 5. 3 software. A total of 10 papers involving 31 studies were finally included,15 studies of which were used for Meta-analysis. Four studies were included for chronic hepatotoxicity animal model. In experimental group( 34 animals),Tripterygium was administered at dose of 0. 09-0. 1 mg·kg-1·d-1,and glycyrrhizic acid was administered at dose of 90-100 mg·kg-1,both for 2 weeks; in control group( 34 animals),glycyrrhizic acid was replaced with equal volume of normal saline. Eleven studies were included for acute hepatotoxicity animal model. In experimental group( 66 animals),glycyrrhizic acid was administered at dose of 75-480 mg·kg-1 for 7 days,then glycyrrhizic acid was stopped,and Tripterygium began to be administered at dose of 0. 6-1. 0 mg·kg-1 per 24 h or 48 h for a total of 1-2 times; in control group( 66 animals),glycyrrhizic acid was replaced with equal volume of normal saline or corresponding solvent. The results of Meta-analysis showed that in both chronic hepatotoxicity animal model and acute hepatotoxicity animal model,the transaminase levels in the experimental group were lower than those in the control group( P {\textless} 0. 05). Subgroup analysis of acute hepatotoxicity animal model showed that the transaminase levels in the experimental group were lower than those in the control group for every subgroup except " glycyrrhizic acid 75 mg·kg-1" subgroup. However,in terms of the mean difference( MD) and confidence interval( CI),there was no significant difference in transaminase decline between each subgroup. Low dose of glycyrrhizic acid( 90-100 mg·kg-1) has a toxicity-reduction effect on chronic hepatotoxicity induced by tripterygium( 0. 09-0. 10 mg·kg-1). Middle and high doses of glycyrrhizic acid( 120-480 mg·kg-1) have a toxicity-reduction effect on acute hepatotoxicity induced by tripterygium( 0. 6-1. 0 mg·kg-1),but with no significant dose-effect relationship.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Trichinella or derived antigens have been suggested to be potential therapeutic agents for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature to estimate the effect of Trichinella or derived antigens on chemically induced IBD. METHODS: Studies were identified by searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Science Direct from inception to February 2020. We included articles written in English that investigated the effect of Trichinella infection and/or derived products in mouse models of IBD. Studies were pooled, and the combined standard mean difference (SMD) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect or fixed-effect model. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were eventually included in the meta-analysis. The results indicated significant differences in the disease activity index (DAI), myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, macroscopic inflammation score, and microscopic inflammation score between the experimental group and the control group. The anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), IL-10 and IL-13 were significantly increased in the experimental group compared with the control group, whereas the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-17 were significantly decreased. The percentage of regulatory T (Treg) cells was also significantly increased, while the level of the M1 phenotypic macrophage marker iNOS was significantly decreased and the expression of the M2 phenotypic macrophage marker Arg-1 was significantly increased.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has been reported mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are recruited to and become integral parts of the tumor microenvironment. MSCs might have an active role in solid tumor progression, especially cancer metastasis. However, the contribution of MSCs in the process of cancer metastasis is still controversial. In this review, we performed a meta-analysis on the effects of MSCs administration on cancer metastasis based on published preclinical studies. METHODS: The PRISMA guidelines were used. A total of 42 publications met the inclusion criteria. Outcome data on the incidence and the number of cancer metastasis as well as study characteristics were extracted. Quality of the studies was assessed according to SYRCLE Risk of Bias tool. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool estimates. RESULTS: Of the 42 studies included, 32 reported that MSCs administration promoted outcome events (numbers or incidences of cancer metastasis), and 39 reported data suitable for meta-analysis. The median effect size (RR) was 2.04 for the incidence of cancer metastasis (95\% CI 1.57-2.65, I(2) = 21\%), and the median effect size (SMD) was 1.23 for the number of cancer metastasis (95\% CI 0.43-2.03, I(2) = 89\%). Heterogeneity was observed, with the greater impact based on study length and different ways of metastasis measurement and MSCs administration. CONCLUSION: Our results suggested MSCs administration increased the number and the incidence of cancer metastasis in experimental cancer models. High heterogeneity and poor reported risk of bias limit the quality of these findings. Further preclinical studies with better design and adequate reporting are still needed.},

Horses are an intermediate host of T. gondii, representing a potential risk for humans. To determine the T. gondii seroprevalence in horses worldwide, a global meta-analysis was conducted. A total of 35 publications were obtained by searching the PubMed, ScienceDirect, Chinese Web of knowledge (CNKI) and Wanfang databases. A total of 12,354 horses were assessed, of which 1580 were positive for T. gondii. The pooled overall seroprevalence of horses infected by T. gondii was 11.29\%. No significant difference of T. gondii seroprevalence was observed between male and female horses. The seroprevalence of T. gondii in horses from different countries varied. Our findings suggest that toxoplasmosis is prevalent in horses worldwide. Therefore, it is necessary to implement continuous monitoring of the status of T. gondii seroprevalence in horses. Moreover, powerful regulatory measures should be implemented to prevent and control the spread of toxoplasmosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Supplementation of feed with long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) during the grower and finisher phases has long been discussed as a growth promotion strategy in pigs, but its effects are inconsistent. The purpose of our study was to comprehensively evaluate its effects on the growth performance based on the average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI) and gain: feed (G:F) ratio and to unveil the roles of the basal diet, LCFA concentration and LCFA saturation. RESULTS: We searched the PubMed and Web of Science databases (articles published from Jan 1(st), 2000, to Sep 30(th), 2018; restricted to English) and compared LCFA-supplemented diets with control diets. We retrieved 2346 studies, 18 of which (1314 pigs, 26 records) were eligible for our analysis. We used a random-effects model to calculate the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). LCFA supplementation in the grower-finisher phase improved the ADG (WMD = 41.74 g/d, 95\% CI: 8.81 to 74.66, P = 0.013) and G:F ratio (WMD = 0.019, 95\% CI: 0.006 to 0.032, P = 0.003). For supplementation solely in the finisher phase, we found a similar performance in the ADG (WMD = 39.93 g/d, 95\% CI: 26.48 to 53.38, P {\textless} 0.001) and G:F ratio (WMD = 0.019, 95\% CI: 0.006 to 0.032, P {\textless} 0.001) but a reduction in the ADFI (WMD = - 83.863 g/d, 95\% CI: - 156.157 to - 11.569, P = 0.023). Specifically, approximately 5\% LCFA supplementation in the finisher phase had significant effects on the ADG (WMD = 51.385 g/d, 95\% CI: 35.816 to 66.954, P {\textless} 0.001), ADFI (WMD = - 102.869 g/d, 95\% CI: - 189.236 to - 16.502, P = 0.02) and G:F ratio (WMD = 0.028, 95\% CI: 0.018 to 0.039, P {\textless} 0.001), whereas a concentration of approximately 1\% exhibited no effects. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, regardless of the basal diet and saturation, LCFA supplementation greatly improves the growth performance of grower and finisher pigs, primarily by increasing the energy density.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Liver cirrhosis (LC) was associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis; however, the association between LC and fracture risk was inconclusive. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the association between LC and fracture risk. DESIGN: To identify related literature, a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of science and the Cochrane Library from 1965 to July 2017 without language limitation was performed. The random-effects model described by DerSimonian and Laird was used to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Eventually, 5 cohort and 3 case-control studies were identified, which included 321 035 subjects and 31 272 fracture cases. The pooled OR of the association between LC and any fracture risk, hip fracture, spine/trunk fracture and limb fracture was 1.94 (95\% CI, 1.59-2.37), 2.11 (95\% CI, 1.34-3.32), 2.00 (95\% CI, 1.50-2.67) and 1.82 (95\% CI, 1.65-2.01), respectively. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this study indicates that cirrhotic patients have an increased risk of fracture. Preventive measures should be instituted as early as possible.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Emerging studies reported that combination of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and nuclear matrix protein 22 (NMP22) could increase the sensitivity and specificity of bladder carcinoma (BC) management. Nevertheless, the reports remain inconsistent. This meta-analysis was undertaken to evaluate the diagnostic performance of FISH, NMP22, and their combination model in BC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang database dated up to October 2018. Suitable studies were identified and raw data were extracted. Meta-analysis was conducted to calculate the global sensitivities, specificities, likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and the areas under the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves for FISH, NMP22, and their combination model, separately. All the meta-analysis estimates were derived using STATA (version 12.0) and MetaDisc (version 1.4) software packages. RESULTS: Seven eligible studies were included for analysis. The global sensitivities with 95\% CI for FISH, NMP22, and their combination model were 0.79 (95\% CI: 0.75-0.83), 0.76 (95\% CI: 0.71-0.81), and 0.82 (95\% CI: 0.75-0.88); specificities were 0.85 (95\% CI: 0.76-0.91), 0.70 (95\% CI: 0.55-0.81), and 0.90 (95\% CI: 0.70-0.97); DORs were 22.215 (95\% CI: 10.695-46.144), 7.365 (95\% CI: 3.986-13.610), and 41.940 (95\% CI: 13.546-129.853); and the areas under the SROC curves were 0.86 (95\% CI: 0.82-0.88), 0.79 (95\% CI: 0.76-0.83), and 0.90 (95\% CI: 0.87-0.92). CONCLUSION: Our systematic review implied that the diagnostic performance of combination model of FISH plus NMP22 may outperform FISH or NMP22 alone in BC detection.},

However, the risk of hepatic damage caused by statin therapy is still controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis summarizing the existing evidence of the effect of statin therapy on incidence of liver injury to clarify whether statin therapy could lead to liver function test abnormalities. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Embase database for the relevant studies update till Jan. 2017 regarding statin therapy and liver injury. Two researchers screened the literature independently by the selection and exclusion criteria. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random effects models, and subgroup analyses were performed by study characteristics. This meta-analysis was performed by STATA 13.1 software. RESULTS: Analyses were based on 74,078 individuals from 16 studies. The summary OR of statin therapy was 1.18 (95\% CI: 1.01-1.39, p = 0.04; I(2) = 0.0\%) for liver injury. Subgroup analysis indicated that fluvastatin increased the risk of liver injury significantly (OR, 3.50; 95\% CI: 1.07-11.53, p = 0.039; I(2) = 0.0\%) and dose over 40 mg/daily had an unfavorable effect on the liver damage (OR, 3.62; 95\% CI: 1.52-8.65, p = 0.004; I(2) = 0.0\%). The sensitivity analysis indicated that the results were robust. CONCLUSION: Our findings confirm that statin therapy substantially increases the risk of liver injury, especially using fluvastatin over 40 mg/d.},

Existing studies remain largely preclinical and exhibit marked design heterogeneity. A systematic review of controlled preclinical trials of human ECFCs is needed to guide future study design and to accelerate clinical translation. A systematic search of Medline and EMBASE on 1 April 2019 returned 3131 unique entries of which 66 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most studies used ECFCs derived from umbilical cord or adult peripheral blood. Studies used genetically modified immunodeficient mice (n = 52) and/or rats (n = 16). ECFC phenotypes were inconsistently characterized. While {\textgreater}90\% of studies used CD31+ and CD45-, CD14- was demonstrated in 73\% of studies, CD146+ in 42\%, and CD10+ in 35\%. Most disease models invoked ischemia. Peripheral vascular ischemia (n = 29), central nervous system ischemia (n = 14), connective tissue injury (n = 10), and cardiovascular ischemia and reperfusion injury (n = 7) were studied most commonly. Studies showed predominantly positive results; only 13 studies reported ≥1 outcome with null results, three reported only null results, and one reported harm. Quality assessment with SYRCLE revealed potential sources of bias in most studies. Preclinical ECFC studies are associated with benefit across several ischemic conditions in animal models, although combining results is limited by marked heterogeneity in study design. In particular, characterization of ECFCs varied and aspects of reporting introduced risk of bias in most studies. More studies with greater focus on standardized cell characterization and consistency of the disease model are needed.},

	abstract = {Background: As not all ischemic stroke patients benefit from currently available treatments, there is considerable need for neuroprotective co-therapies. Therapeutic hypothermia is one such co-therapy, but numerous issues have hampered its clinical use (e.g., pneumonia risk with whole-body cooling). Some problems may be avoided with brain-specific methods, such as intra-arterial selective cooling infusion (IA-SCI) into the arteries supplying the ischemic tissue. Objective: Our research question was about the efficacy of IA-SCI in animal middle cerebral artery occlusion models. We hypothesized that IA-SCI would be beneficial, but translationally-relevant study elements may be missing (e.g., aged animals). Methods: We completed a systematic review of the PubMed database following the PRISMA guidelines on May 21, 2020 for animal studies that administered IA-SCI in the peri-reperfusion period and assessed infarct volume, behavior (primary meta-analytic endpoints), edema, or blood-brain barrier injury (secondary endpoints). Our search terms included: "focal ischemia" and related terms, "IA-SCI" and related terms, and "animal" and related terms. Nineteen studies met inclusion criteria. We adapted a methodological quality scale from 0 to 12 for experimental design assessment (e.g., use of blinding/randomization, a priori sample size calculations). Results: Studies were relatively homogenous (e.g., all studies used young, healthy animals). Some experimental design elements, such as blinding, were common whereas others, such as sample size calculations, were infrequent (median methodological quality score: 5; range: 2-7). Our analyses revealed that IA-SCI provides benefit on all endpoints (mean normalized infarct volume reduction = 23.67\%; 95\% CI: 19.21-28.12; mean normalized behavioral improvement = 35.56\%; 95\% CI: 25.91-45.20; mean standardized edema reduction = 0.95; 95\% CI: 0.56-1.34). Unfortunately, blood-brain barrier assessments were uncommon and could not be analyzed. However, there was substantial statistical heterogeneity and relatively few studies. Therefore, exploration of heterogeneity via meta-regression using saline infusion parameters, study quality, and ischemic duration was inconclusive. Conclusion: Despite convincing evidence of benefit in ischemic stroke models, additional studies are required to determine the scope of benefit, especially when considering additional elements (e.g., dosing characteristics). As there is interest in using this treatment alongside current ischemic stroke therapies, more relevant animal studies will be critical to inform patient studies.},

Two-phase screening procedures were conducted by a pair of independent reviewers, data were extracted from eligible studies and qualitatively reported. Results: The literature search resulted in 231 articles of which 78 met inclusion criteria and were sorted by intervention type. Joint mobilization induced changes in nociceptive response and inflammatory profile, gene expression, receptor activation, neurotransmitter release and enzymatic activity. Spinal manipulation produced changes in muscle spindle response, nocifensive reflex response and neuronal activity, electromyography, and immunologic response. Physiological changes associated with massage therapy included autonomic, circulatory, lymphatic and immunologic functions, visceral response, gene expression, neuroanatomy, function and pathology, and cellular response to in vitro simulated massage. Conclusion: Pre-clinical research supports an association between MT physiological response and multiple potential short-term MT therapeutic mechanisms. Optimization of MT delivery and/or treatment efficacy will require additional preclinical investigation in which MT delivery parameters are controlled and reported using pathological and/or chronic pain models that mimic neuromusculoskeletal conditions for which MT has demonstrated clinical benefit.},

	abstract = {We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the rate of polymyxin resistance among Acinetobacter baumannii isolates causing infection in hospitalized patients around the world during the period of 2010-2019. The systematic review was performed on September 1, 2019, using PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science; studies published after January 1, 2010, were selected. The data were summarized in tables, critically analyzed, and treated statistically using the RStudio® Software with Meta package and Metaprop Command. After applying exclusion factors, 41 relevant studies were selected from 969 articles identified on literature search. The overall rate of polymyxin-resistant A. baumannii (PRAB) related to hospitalized patients was estimated to be 13\% (95\% CI, 0.06-0.27), where a higher rate was observed in America (29\%; 95\% CI, 0.12-0.55), followed by Europe (13\%; 95\% CI, 0.02-0.52), and Asia (10\%; 95\% CI, 0.02-0.32). The extensive use of polymyxins on veterinary to control bacterial infection and growth promotion, as well as the resurgence in prescription and use of polymyxins in the clinics against carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria, may have contributed to the increased incidence of PRAB. The findings of this meta-analysis revealed that the rate of PRAB recovered from hospitalized patients is distinctively high. Thus, action needs to be taken to develop strategies to combat the clinical incidence of PRAB-induced hospital infections.},

	abstract = {Leishmaniases are a group of diseases of zoonotic importance caused by over 20 species of protozoa of the genus Leishmania, in which domestic dogs are considered to be the main reservoir for the disease. However, the involvement of other vertebrates as reservoirs for these parasites has also been investigated. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to carry out a systematic review with meta-analysis on occurrences of leishmaniasis in equids. The case reports described animals with cutaneous symptoms of leishmaniasis (papules, nodules, ulcers or crusts) that regressed spontaneously, located mainly on the head and limbs, from which three species of protozoa were identified in the lesions: Leishmania braziliensis, Leishmania infantum and Leishmania siamensis. In turn, the meta-analysis showed a combined prevalence of 25\%, although with high heterogeneity among the studies, which was attributed to the use of different methods for diagnosing the disease. Leishmaniasis in equids is a benign disease but it should be included in the differential diagnosis of cutaneous diseases among these species. Seroepidemiological studies are important in investigating and monitoring suspected exposure of these hosts to the parasite, especially in endemic areas. However, there is also a need to standardize diagnostic methods.},

The objectives of this study were: (1) To identify novel pharmacological therapies investigated in experimental animal studies and (2) to identify pharmacological therapies translated from experimental animal studies to clinical trials. METHODS: PubMed was searched to first identify relevant experimental cardiac arrest animal models published within the last 20 years. Based on this, a list of interventions was created and a second search was performed to identify clinical trials testing one of these interventions. Data extraction was performed using standardised data extraction forms. RESULTS: We identified 415 animal studies testing 190 different pharmacological interventions. The most commonly tested interventions were classified as vasopressors, anaesthetics/gases, or interventions aimed at molecular targets. We found 43 clinical trials testing 26 different interventions identified in the animal studies. Of these, 13 trials reported positive findings and 30 trials reported neutral findings with regards to the primary endpoint. No study showed harm of the intervention. Some interventions tested in human clinical trials, had previously been tested in animal studies without a positive effect on outcomes. A large number of animal studies was performed after publication of a clinical trial. CONCLUSION: Numerous different pharmacological interventions have been tested in experimental animal models. Despite this only a limited number of these interventions have advanced to clinical trials, however several of the clinical trials tested interventions that were first tested in experimental animal models.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Having a service dog can help to increase independence and well-being among people with a disability or a chronic health condition. Although there has been an increasing use of service dogs among children and youth their impact has not yet been synthesized. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article was to conduct a systematic review assessing the impact of service dogs on children, youth and their families. METHODS: Systematic searches of seven international databases from 1985 to 2020 led to 29 studies meeting our inclusion criteria. Using a narrative synthesis review approach we analyzed these studies regarding their sample characteristics, methods, results and quality of evidence. RESULTS: There were 29 studies in our review that included 1121 children and youth (or parents representing them) that spanned across six countries over a 32-year period. Although the outcomes of the impact of service dogs varied across the studies, 23/29 of them reported an improvement in at least one of the following: physical health (i.e., diabetes management, seizure management, mobility), psychological health (i.e., quality of life, safety, behavior, stress, anxiety, self-confidence and independence), social well-being (i.e., social interactions, school and work) and dog-owner-bond. Children, youth and their parents also described several challenges in owning a service dog. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that service dogs have potential to provide many benefits for children, youth and their families. Further research, including more rigorously designed studies, is needed to fully understand their impact.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Despite inter-individual variations in their diagnostic efficiency, dogs have been trained to investigate many human pathologies, especially cancer, diabetes, migraine, seizures and even infectious diseases. To this end, we performed a critical review and pooled analysis of current scientific literature on the performance of dogs trained for identifying severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive human specimens. METHODS: We carried out an electronic search in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science with the keywords "dog(s)" AND "sniffer" OR "scent" OR "smell" AND "SARS-CoV-2" OR "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2" OR "coronavirus disease 2019" OR "COVID-19" within all fields, without date or language restrictions, to identify studies describing dogs' performance for identifying SARS-CoV-2 infected material. RESULTS: Three studies could be finally included in pooled analysis, totaling 17 dogs (47\% females), aged between 0.5 and 12 years. The pooled diagnostic sensitivity was 0.88 (95\% CI, 0.84-0.91; I (2), 85.3\%), the diagnostic specificity 0.99 (95\% CI, 0.99-0.99; I (2), 97.4\%), whilst the area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC) was 0.979 (standard error, 0.003).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cryptosporidiosis is an emerging infectious disease of public health significance worldwide. The burden of disease caused by Cryptosporidium varies between and within countries/areas. To have a comprehensive understanding of epidemiological status and characteristics of human Cryptosporidium infection in China since the first report in 1987, a retrospective epidemiological analysis was conducted by presenting differences in the prevalence of Cryptosporidium by province, year, population, living environment and season and possible transmission routes and risk factors as well as genetic characteristics of Cryptosporidium in humans. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A systematic search was conducted to obtain epidemiological papers of human Cryptosporidium infection/cryptosporidiosis from PubMed and Chinese databases. Finally, 164 papers were included in our analysis. At least 200,054 people from 27 provinces were involved in investigational studies of Cryptosporidium, with an average prevalence of 2.97\%. The prevalence changed slightly over time. Variable prevalences were observed: 0.65-11.15\% by province, 1.89-47.79\% by population, 1.77-12.87\% and 0-3.70\% in rural and urban areas, respectively. The prevalence peak occurred in summer or autumn. Indirect person-to-person transmission was documented in one outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in a pediatric hospital. 263 Cryptosporidium isolates were obtained, and seven Cryptosporidium species were identified: C. hominis (48.3\%), C. andersoni (22.43\%), C. parvum (16.7\%), C. meleagridis (8.36\%), C. felis (3.04\%), C. canis (0.76\%) and C. suis (0.38\%). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCES: This systematic review reflects current epidemiological status and characteristics of Cryptosporidium in humans in China. These data will be helpful to develop efficient control strategies to intervene with and prevent occurrence of human Cryptosporidium infection/cryptosporidiosis in China as well as have a reference effect to other countries. Further studies should focus on addressing a high frequency of C. andersoni in humans and a new challenge with respect to cryptosporidiosis with an increasing population of elderly people and patients with immunosuppressive diseases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute lung injury (ALI) is characterized by suppressed fibrinolytic activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) attributed to elevated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Restoring pulmonary fibrinolysis by delivering tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), and plasmin could be a promising approach. OBJECTIVES: To systematically analyze the overall benefit of fibrinolytic therapy for ALI reported in preclinical studies. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and CNKI Chinese databases, and analyzed data retrieved from 22 studies for the beneficial effects of fibrinolytics on animal models of ALI. RESULTS: Both large and small animals were used with five routes for delivering tPA, uPA, and plasmin. Fibrinolytics significantly increased the fibrinolytic activity both in the plasma and BALF. Fibrin degradation products in BALF had a net increase of 408.41 ng/ml vs controls (P {\textless} 0.00001). In addition, plasma thrombin-antithrombin complexes increased 1.59 ng/ml over controls (P = 0.0001). In sharp contrast, PAI-1 level in BALF decreased 21.44 ng/ml compared with controls (P {\textless} 0.00001). Arterial oxygen tension was improved by a net increase of 15.16 mmHg, while carbon dioxide pressure was significantly reduced (11.66 mmHg, P = 0.0001 vs controls). Additionally, fibrinolytics improved lung function and alleviated inflammation response: the lung wet/dry ratio was decreased 1.49 (P {\textless} 0.0001 vs controls), lung injury score was reduced 1.83 (P {\textless} 0.00001 vs controls), and BALF neutrophils were lesser (3 × 10(4)/ml, P {\textless} 0.00001 vs controls). The mortality decreased significantly within defined study periods (6 h to 30 days for mortality), as the risk ratio of death was 0.2-fold of controls (P = 0.0008).

OBJECTIVES: This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to evaluate the effects of stem cells on rotator cuff healing. METHODS: A detailed search of relevant studies was conducted in three databases including Pubmed/ Medline, Cochrane library, and Embase databases, using the following keywords: "rotator cuff" or "Tissue Engineering" AND "stem cell" from inception to January 01, 2019. The standard mean difference (SMD) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) for each individual study were extracted from the original studies or calculated based on relevant data and pooled to obtain integrated estimates using random effects modeling. RESULTS: A total of 22 studies were identified. The results demonstrated that the ultimate strain in the stem cell group was significantly higher than that in the control group at 4 and 8 weeks. Muscle weight in the stem cell group was higher than the control group at 8 weeks, while no significant differences were detected at 16 weeks. The stem cell group had lower visual analog scale scores (VAS) at 1, 3, and 6 months, and higher American shoulder and elbow surgeons score (ASES) at 3 months. In addition, the walking distance, time, and speed in the stem cell group were significantly superior to those in the control group.

CONCLUSION: HA/CMC coating reduces adhesion formation to PP mesh effectively at a follow-up of 4 weeks, while the anti-adhesive properties of PC mesh are inclusive comparing all study data.},

	abstract = {Various researches have reported that the application of topical insulin improves wound healing. Considering the lack of a quantitative comprehensive research on this matter, we conducted a meta-analysis of clinical research and experimental animal studies. Prospective and randomized controlled trials of PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were conducted using appropriate search strategies to compare the effectiveness of topical application of saline and insulin on wounds. The standardized mean difference was calculated as follows: wound healing time, wound healing rate, wound area, and the percentage of wound contraction. Each study used the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and RevMan 5.3 software to create aggregated assessments and forest plots. The quality of evidence was evaluated in accordance with the methods of the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group. Four clinical and nine animal studies eligible for inclusion were included in the meta-analysis. The assessments for clinical studies were as follows: wound healing time, -2.48 [-3.44, -1.51] and wound healing rate, 22.23 [18.17, 26.28]. Meanwhile, for animal studies, the following assessments were noted: wound healing time, -1.27 [-1.75, -0.79]; wound contraction rate, 15.91 [13.88, 17.95]; and wound area, -19.3 [-21.16, -17.44]. For the measurement of the following results, only one animal study was performed, pericyte recruitment of microvessels. Based on the analysis, it can be preliminarily judged that application of topical insulin can aid wound healing.},

However, their pooled effects for dopaminergic neuron have yet to be described. Objective: To review the neuroprotective effect of naïve BMSCs in rodent models of PD. Methods: The PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were searched up to September 30, 2020. Inclusion criteria according to PICOS criteria were as follows: (1) population: rodents; (2) intervention: unmodified BMSCs; (3) comparison: not specified; (4) primary outcome: tyrosine hydroxylase level in the substantia nigra pars compacta and rotational behavior; secondary outcome: rotarod test, and limb function; (5) study: experimental studies. Multiple prespecified subgroup and meta-regression analysis were conducted. Following quality assessment, random effects models were used for this meta-analysis. Results: Twenty-seven animal studies were included. The median quality score was 4.7 (interquartile range, 2-8). Overall standardized mean difference between animals treated with naïve BMSCs and controls was 2.79 (95\% confidence interval: 1.70, 3.87; P {\textless} 0.001) for densitometry of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive staining; -1.54 (95\% confidence interval: -2.11, -0.98; P {\textless} 0.001) for rotational behavior. Significant heterogeneity among studies was observed. Conclusions: Results of this meta-analysis suggest that naïve BMSCs therapy increased dopaminergic neurons and ameliorated behavioral deficits in rodent models of PD.},

Certain immunomodulatory components and Chinese herbal formulae have been used in traditional herbal medicine for thousands of years. However, there are few studies performing evidence-based Chinese medicine (CM) research on the mechanisms and efficacy of these drugs in allergic asthma. This review aims to explore the roles of Chinese herbal formulae and herb-derived compounds in experimental research models of allergic asthma. We screened published modern CM research results on the experimental effects of Chinese herbal formulae and herb-derived bioactive compounds for allergic asthma and their possible underlying mechanisms in English language articles from the PubMed and the Google Scholar databases with the keywords allergic asthma, experimental model and Chinese herbal medicine. We found 22 Chinese herb species and 31 herb-derived anti-asthmatic compounds as well as 12 Chinese herbal formulae which showed a reduction of airway hyperresponsiveness, allergen-specific immunoglobulin E, inflammatory cell infiltration and a regulation of Th1 and Th2 cytokines in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo, respectively. Chinese herbal formulae and herb-derived bioactive compounds exhibit immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-asthma activities in different experimental models and their various mechanisms of action are being investigated in modern CM research with genomics, proteomics and metabolomics technologies, which will lead to a new era in the development of new drug discovery for allergic asthma in CM.},

The lung is one of the most commonly encountered sites of Scedosporium infection. Due to its very high levels of antifungal resistance, surgery has been recommended as an important part in the treatment of pulmonary Scedosporium spp infection, even in immunocompetent cases. However, whether lung surgery could help to reduce the risk of death in immunocompetent patients is not clear.We retrospectively retrieved the records of pulmonary infections with Scedosporium species in immunocompetent patients through a comprehensive literature search. The association of surgery on all-cause mortality was explored using binary logistic regression (BLR). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was carried out to evaluate the capability of the model.The comprehensive searching strategy yielded 33 case reports and 3 case series in total, with 40 individual patients being included. The overall mortality was 12.50\%. The fatality rate was 9.09\% (2/22) in cases with surgery and 16.67\% (3/18) in cases without surgery (odds ratio, 0.50; 95\% confidence interval, 0.07-3.38; P = .48). Consistently, BLR analysis identified no statistical association between surgery and reduced mortality (odds ratio, 1.19; 95\% confidence interval, 0.09-15.64; P = .89), after adjusting for age, gender, and antifungal chemotherapy. The area under the ROC curve was 0.88.For immunocompetent patients with pulmonary Scedosporium spp infection, surgical therapy may not be associated with reduced mortality.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We sought to identify common ion channel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the occurrence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) to predict the incidence of SCD in clinical settings. METHODS: This study involved a systematic review and meta-analysis of ion channel SNPs and risk of SCD in adults. We searched public databases for studies published up to September 19, 2017. We examined relationships between SNPs in common ion channel genes and the incidence of SCD. RESULTS: We collected data for 22 trials that included a total of 4149 patients who experienced SCD or had a high risk of SCD and assessed these data in our meta-analysis. An allelic model showed that rs11720524 in SCN5A clearly protected against SCD (odds ratio [OR]: 0.76; 95\% confidence interval [95\% CI]: 0.67-0.85; P {\textless} .001). Subgroup analysis showed that rs11720524 in SCN5A protected against SCD in Europeans and Caucasians but not in Koreans. The allelic model indicated that rs12296050 in KCNQ1 also had significant protective effects against SCD (OR: 0.85; 95\% CI: 0.76-0.96; P = .007). Moreover, this model demonstrated that rs2283222 in KCNQ1 had a significant negative relationship with SCD (OR: 0.73; 95\% CI: 0.62-0.85; P {\textless} .001). Rs12296050 in KCNQ1 protected against SCD in Koreans and Americans. Our results also showed that rs790896 in RYR2 was negatively associated with SCD in a dominant model (OR: 0.66; 95\% CI: 0.45-0.97; P = .033).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Restoring the shoulder function is a crucial demand of patients with rotator cuff (RC) tears. Most preclinical studies only focused on biological and mechanical measurements. Functional assessment was less investigated in the preclinical studies. This study aims to review the literature of shoulder function in animal models for RC tears and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different shoulder functional assessments and animal models. METHOD: A literature search for studies used RC tear animal models to evaluate changes in shoulder function was performed. We searched databases of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to September 2019. Animal species, functional parameters, injury and repair types, and study durations were summarised. Cluster analyses were then used to separate animal models with different levels of injury and timings of repair. The reliability and clinical relevance of the included assessments and animal models were then discussed. RESULTS: Fourteen animal studies that related to shoulder function in animal models of RC tears were reviewed. Five methods (gait analysis, passive range of motion test, open field test, staircase test, and running endurance test) to assess shoulder function were identified. Single or massive RC tendon tears and immediate or delayed RC repair models were found. We reported and discussed factors to be considered when researchers would select assessments and animal models for different study purposes. CONCLUSION: Based on current evidences, gait analysis is the most appropriate method to assess changes in shoulder function of animal models of RC tears. More studies are required to further elucidate the reliability of passive range of motion measurement, open field test, staircase test, and running endurance test. Models that use massive tears and delayed repair better represent the clinical condition found in humans. THE TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THIS ARTICLE: Using more clinically relevant animal models and assessments for shoulder function identified in this review may help to investigate the value of preclinical researches and promote translation of preclinical interventions into clinical practices.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between livestock exposure and MRSA carriage. Pooled risk estimates were calculated using fixed-effects or random-effects models based on homogeneity analysis. A dose-response meta-analysis based on linear and non-linear regression was performed to explore the frequency-risk relationship between livestock exposure and MRSA carriage. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore sources of heterogeneity among eligible studies. A total of 25 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Livestock exposure was significantly associated with an increased risk of MRSA carriage [odds ratio (OR) = 7.03, 95\% confidence interval 4.29-11.52], and similar positive associations were observed for pig (OR = 11.41), poultry (OR = 6.20) and cattle (OR = 5.66) exposure. Regarding studies on ordinal and continuous frequency of livestock exposure, a monotonically increasing frequency-risk relationship between livestock (or pig) exposure and MRSA carriage was consistently observed. This study found a monotonically increasing frequency-risk relationship between livestock exposure and MRSA carriage, which provides evidence for potential livestock-to-human transmission of MRSA.},

	abstract = {Meat products are commonly regarded as one of the main sources of human listeriosis caused by Listeria monocytogenes. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of L. monocytogenes in a range of meat products from 24 different Chinese regions by using meta-analysis of literature data and a novel sensitivity analysis approach. A total of 112 publications from five databases, published between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2017, were systematically selected for relevance and covered meat products sampled between 2000 and 2016. Estimated by the random-effects model, the pooled prevalence of L. monocytogenes was 8.5\% (95\% CI: 7.1\%-10.3\%) in raw meats and 3.2\% (95\% CI: 2.7\%-3.9\%) in ready-to-eat (RTE) meats. The prevalence differed from high to low among raw meats including prefabricated raw meats 12.6\% (95\% CI: 6.9\%-21.7\%), fresh pork 11.4\% (95\% CI: 8.6\%-14.9\%), fresh beef 9.1\% (95\% CI: 6.3\%-13.0\%), fresh poultry 7.2\% (95\% CI:4.9\%-10.4\%), frozen raw meats 7.2\% (95\% CI: 5.7\%-9.0\%), and fresh mutton 5.4\% (95\% CI: 2.5\%-11.0\%). A higher L. monocytogenes prevalence level was shown in the meat products from central and northeastern China provincial regions. The entropy-based sensitivity analysis utilized in the meta-analysis indicated that the sampling period and location were two critical factors influencing the prevalence level of L. monocytogenes in meat products. A better understanding of differences in prevalence levels per geographic region and between meat product sources may allow the competent authorities, industry, and other relevant stakeholders to tailor their interventions to control the occurrence of L. monocytogenes in meat products effectively.},

	abstract = {Background: Vaccine-development research is proliferating making it difficult to determine the most promising vaccine candidates. Exemplary of this problem is vaccine development against Chlamydia, a pathogen of global public health and financial importance.Methods: We systematically extracted data from studies that included chlamydial load or host immune parameter measurements, estimating 4,453 standardized effect sizes between control and chlamydial immunization experimental groups.Results: Chlamydial immunization studies most often used (78\%) laboratory mouse models. Depending on chlamydial species, single and multiple recombinant protein, viral and bacterial vectors, dendritic transfer, and dead whole pathogen were most effective at reducing chlamydial load. Immunization-driven decrease in chlamydial load was associated with increases in IFNg, IgA, IgG1, and IgG2a. Using data from individual studies, the magnitude of IgA and IgG2a increase was correlated with chlamydial load reduction. IFNg also showed this pattern for C. trachomatis, but not for C. muridarum. We also reveal the chlamydial vaccine development field to be highly bias toward studies showing these effects, limiting lessons learned from negative results.Conclusions: Most murine immunizations against Chlamydia reduced chlamydial load and increased host immune parameters. These methods are novel for vaccine development and are critical in identifying trends where large quantities of literature exist.},

A total of 67 scientific articles published in peer-reviewed journals from 1951 to 2018 were selected for revision. Results indicate that the number of publications has increased per decade but there are years in which no articles were published. Most studies addressed Leptospira, rabies, hantavirus, Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) and distemper. Rodentia, Carnivora, Chiroptera and Cetartiodactyla were the most studied mammal orders. Information about presence/absence of pathogens was found for 44 wild mammal species. Research was mainly carried out in central and southern Chile and the most commonly employed methods for pathogen diagnosis were serology and molecular techniques. Overall, research in wild mammals has been directed towards the evaluation of zoonotic diseases, while vector-borne and non-zoonotic diseases have been mostly neglected by the scientific community over the years.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chagas disease is a major public health problem in Latin America. A neglected disease of poor and rural Latin American populations, it has now emerged in other regions and urban areas due to international migration. In Colombia, systematic data pertaining to the disease's magnitude in the general population and its distribution within regions are lacking. Our objective is to describe the prevalence of Chagas disease in Colombia through a meta-analysis and systematic review. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search using several electronic databases, gray literature, and reference lists of selected articles for population-based studies on Chagas disease prevalence in Colombia was performed between 1990 and 2017. Articles published in either English or Spanish were included. Pooled prevalence estimates and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for Chagas disease in the general population using a meta-analysis random-effects model. Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity among studies. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine whether publication bias existed. RESULTS: Seventeen articles with relevant prevalence data were identified from a total of 1213 references. The initial pooled estimate of Chagas disease prevalence across studies for the entire period was 4.10\% (95\% CI: 2.23-7.41). After removing studies with large effect and small sample sizes, the pooled estimate was 1.67\% (95\% CI: 0.95-2.92). A high degree of heterogeneity in most pooled estimates was observed, even after subgroup analysis. The Orinoquía region, rural areas, males, and persons aged ≥15 years yielded the highest pooled prevalence. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: Higher prevalence was observed in select regions, rural areas, and older teenagers and adults. Additional population-based studies within Colombia are recommended to provide more stable and reliable estimates and identify high-risk areas and groups.},

	doi = {10.1111/edt.12365},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Tooth avulsion consists of the complete displacement of a tooth from the alveolar socket. When immediate replantation is not possible, the avulsed tooth should be kept in a storage medium capable of maintaining the viability of periodontal ligament (PDL) cells on the root surface. However, there is no consensus on the best storage medium able to prevent sequels such as ankylosis and tooth resorption. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review to evaluate the in vivo effectiveness of different storage media for avulsed teeth. METHODS: Two reviewers performed a database search for studies published between January 1950 and December 2015 which were indexed in the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Bireme databases. An additional manual search was performed. Studies with animal models that evaluated tooth avulsion, storage media, and replantation were included. After full-text analysis of the potentially relevant studies, the selected studies were included in the systematic review. RESULTS: The database search found 157 distinct studies evaluating avulsed teeth storage media. However, only six studies met the selection criteria and were included in the review. There was a high variability in the study estimates for the parameters analyzed. When assessing the quality and level of evidence of each study, one study was rated as having a very low level of evidence, four studies had low levels of evidence, and one had a moderate level of evidence. CONCLUSION: As a result of data heterogeneity and limitations of the studies, there was insufficient evidence to determine the most effective storage medium for avulsed teeth.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The socket seal surgery (SSS) technique is a common alternative for the management of the post-extraction sockets that requires a primary closure of the wound to promote proper regeneration and ridge preservation. OBJECTIVE: To learn about the effect of different SSS techniques on alveolar ridge preservation MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two independent and calibrated reviewers conducted an electronic search in PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science for randomized clinical trials (RCT) published up to June 2020. The evaluation of the risk of bias in the included studies was carried out following the Cochrane manual for interventions of systematic reviews, version 5.1.0. A meta-analysis of ridge width changes at - 1, - 3, and - 5 mm cutoff points from bone crest was conducted using a random-effects model. The risk of types I and II errors against accrued data was appraised obtaining the required information size using a trial sequential analysis package (TSA). RESULTS: A total of 135 sockets located in the esthetic zone were evaluated with a minimum of a 3-month follow-up after tooth extraction in 6 RCTs. The evaluated SSS techniques were free gingival graft (FGG), collagen matrix (CM), collagen sponge (CS), acellular dermal matrix (ADM), and polytetrafluoroethylene membrane (PTFEm). The FGG in sockets without bone filling showed significant results in preserving both buccal and lingual bone height (- 1.42 mm in the experimental group versus - 0.01 in the control group). The comparison of CM and FGG with bone filling did not show clinical differences in terms of dimensional bone changes. No clinical differences were found in either width or gingival thickness when comparing CM and CS. The meta-analyses of RW changes comparing CM versus FGG showed no significant differences, but a trend for lessening horizontal reduction at - 1, - 3, and - 5 mm in favor of FGG. The TSA showed that accrued data did not reach the required information size, and more evidence is required for clinical significance inferences. CONCLUSIONS: There are several predictable SSS techniques to improve clinical results in ridge preservation. More clinical studies in the form of clinical trials are required to demonstrate the superiority of one technique over another.},

This first overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses was carried out with the main objective of compiling and discussing the evidence generated to date related to milk and dairy product consumption and prostate cancer risk and mortality. A systematic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Web of Science (from inception to 30 April 2018) was conducted. The inclusion criteria were as follows: adult men, meta-analyses of longitudinal studies, dairy product consumption, and risk of prostate cancer or related outcomes. The AMSTAR2 checklist was used to evaluate methodological quality. The synthesis methods included dairy product exposure (high compared with low consumption or dose-response), dairy product type (total dairy products, milk, cheese, yogurt, and others), and prostate cancer outcomes (total, nonadvanced, and advanced prostate cancer and mortality) displayed in forest plots. Six meta-analyses were identified. These studies reported on the analysis of the 2 to 32 cohorts (up to 848,395 subjects/38,107 cases; 4-28 y of follow-up) and 2 case-control meta-analyses (12,435 subjects). The meta-analysis quality was valued as mostly "good" according to the AMSTAR2 criteria. All RRs of high compared with low consumption (dose-response) for total prostate cancer ranged from 1.68 to 1.09 (1.07 per 400 g/d) for total dairy products, 1.50 to 0.92 (1.06 to 0.98 per 200 g/d) for milk (whole, low-fat, and skim milk considered separately), and 1.18 to 0.74 (1.10 per 50 g/d) for cheese. RRs have decreased since the first meta-analysis. Statistical heterogeneity generates uncertainty in the observed results (up to I2 = 77.1\%). In conclusion, although there are some data indicating that higher consumption of dairy products could increase the risk of prostate cancer, the evidence is not consistent.

New work is emerging related to SARS-CoV-2; previous work has been conducted on other coronaviruses that affect different species. We reviewed the literature on host genetic factors related to coronaviruses, systematically focusing on human studies. We identified 1,832 articles of potential relevance. Seventy-five involved human host genetic factors, 36 of which involved analysis of specific genes or loci; aside from one meta-analysis, all were candidate-driven studies, typically investigating small numbers of research subjects and loci. Three additional case reports were described. Multiple significant loci were identified, including 16 related to susceptibility (seven of which identified protective alleles) and 16 related to outcomes (three of which identified protective alleles). The types of cases and controls used varied considerably; four studies used traditional replication/validation cohorts. Among other studies, 30 involved both human and non-human host genetic factors related to coronavirus, 178 involved study of non-human (animal) host genetic factors related to coronavirus, and 984 involved study of non-genetic host factors related to coronavirus, including involving immunopathogenesis. Previous human studies have been limited by issues that may be less impactful now, including low numbers of eligible participants and limited availability of advanced genomic methods; however, these may raise additional considerations. We outline key genes and loci from animal and human host genetic studies that may bear investigation in the study of COVID-19.

RESULTS: Among the 10 evaluated studies that met inclusionary criteria for this systematic review, 7 were conducted in animal models (rats or mice), with 3 utilizing human samples. Among the seven animal model studies, all employed a fear conditioning paradigm to evaluate implicit memory performance. All six animal studies employing a chronic exercise paradigm demonstrated evidence for associations between chronic exercise and enhanced fear conditioning. The one animal study evaluating a high-intensity acute bout of exercise showed that high-intensity acute exercise worsened implicit memory retrieval. Among the three human studies, one demonstrated a beneficial effect of acute exercise on implicit memory function. DISCUSSION: There is consistent evidence in animal models that chronic exercise enhances implicit memory, as assessed by fear conditioning. However, there have been too few human studies investigating this topic to render any meaningful conclusions regarding the relationship between exercise and cognitive-based implicit memory among humans.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper was to systematically evaluate the potential preventive and therapeutic effects of exercise in attenuating stress-induced memory impairment. A systematic review was employed, searching PubMed, PsychInfo, Sports Discus and Google Scholar databases. For eligibility, studies had to be published in English, employ an experimental design, have the acute or chronic bout of exercise occur prior to, during or after the stressor, implement a psychophysiological stressor, and have an assessment of memory function occurring after the stressor. In total, 23 studies were evaluated, all of which were conducted among animal models. All 23 studies employed a chronic exercise protocol and a chronic stress protocol. Eight studies evaluated a preventive model, three employed a concurrent model, ten studies employed a therapeutic model, and two studies evaluated both a preventive and therapeutic model within the same study. Among the eight studies employing a preventive model, all eight demonstrated that the stress regimen impaired memory function. In all eight of these studies, when exercise occurred prior to the stressor, exercise attenuated the stress-induced memory impairment effect. Among the ten studies employing a therapeutic model, one study showed that the stress protocol enhanced memory function, one showed that the stress protocol did not influence memory, and eight demonstrated that the stress regimen impaired memory function. Among the eight studies showing that the stress protocol impaired memory function, all eight studies demonstrated that exercise, after the stressor, attenuated stress-induced memory impairment. Within animal models, chronic stress is associated with memory impairment and chronic exercise has both a preventive and therapeutic effect in attenuating stress-induced memory impairment. Additional experimental work in human studies is needed. Such work should also examine acute exercise and stress protocols.},

The aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effectiveness of dental pulp stem cells and synthetic block complexes for bone defect treatment in preclinical in vivo articles. METHODS: The electronic database and manual search was conducted on Pubmed, Scopus, and EMBASE. The papers identified were submitted for risk-of-bias assessment and classified according to new bone formation, bone graft characteristics, dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) culture passages and amount of experimental data. The meta-analysis assessment was conducted to assess new bone formation in test sites with DPSCs/synthetic blocks vs. synthetic block alone. RESULTS: The database search identified a total of 348 papers. After the initial screening, 30 studies were included, according to the different animal models: 19 papers on rats, 3 articles on rabbits, 2 manuscripts on sheep and 4 papers on swine. The meta-analysis evaluation showed a significantly increase in new bone formation in favor of DPSCs/synthetic scaffold complexes, if compared to the control at 4 weeks (Mean Diff: 17.09\%, 95\% CI: 15.16-18.91\%, p {\textless} 0.01) and at 8 weeks (Mean Diff: 14.86\%, 95\% CI: 1.82-27.91\%, p {\textless} 0.01) in rats calvaria bone defects. CONCLUSION: The synthetic scaffolds in association of DPSCs used for the treatment of bone defects showed encouraging results of early new bone formation in preclinical animal studies and could represent a useful resource for regenerative bone augmentation procedures.},

We systematically searched PubMed/Medline, SportDiscuss, Scopus, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Scielo database on May 18, 2020. Thirty-four studies were included measuring total (mCSA) or mean muscle fibers cross-sectional area (fCSA) or maximum load-carrying capacity (MLCC) or muscle mass (MM). About the main results, LRT provides sufficient mechanical stimulation to increase mCSA and fCSA. Meta-analysis showed a significant overall effect on the fCSA (SMD 1.89, 95\% CI [1.18, 2.61], p {\textless} .00001, I(2)  = 85\%); however, subgroup analysis showed that some muscle types might not be hypertrophied through the LRT. Meta-analysis showed a significant training effect on the MM (SMD 0.92, 95\% CI [0.52, 1.32], p {\textless} .00001, I(2)  = 72\%). Sub-group analysis revealed that soleus (SMD 1.32, 95\% CI [0.11, 2.54], p = .03, I(2)  = 86\%) and FHL (SMD 1.92, 95\% CI [1.00, 2.85], p {\textless} .0001, I(2)  = 71\%) presented significant training effects, despite moderate heterogeneity levels (I(2)  = 72\%). MLCC increases considerably after a period of LRT, regardless of its duration and the characteristics of the protocols (SMD 12.37, 95\% CI [9.36, 15.37], p {\textless} .00001, I(2)  = 90\%). Through these results, we reach the following conclusions: (a) LRT is efficient to induce muscle hypertrophy, although this effect varies between different types of skeletal muscles, and; (b) the ability of rodents to carry load increases regardless of the type and duration of the protocol used.},

This study reports the results of a systematic review of the literature published between January 2007 and October 2017. The aim was to quantitatively analyze the effectiveness of decellularized nerve grafts in rat experimental models. The review included 33 studies in which eight different decellularization protocols were described. The decellularized nerve grafts were reported to be immunologically safe and able to support both functional and morphological regeneration after nerve injury. Chemical protocols were found to be superior to physical protocols. However, further research is needed to optimize preparation protocols, including recellularization, improve their effectiveness, and substitute the current gold standard, especially in the repair of long nerve defects.},

METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang Data, and CBM were searched for animal experiments on moxibustion intervention for rheumatoid arthritis. Related data were extracted, and RevMan 5.3 was used to perform a meta-analysis of outcome measures, including serum tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin-17 (IL-17), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappa B ligand (RANKL), transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and degree of swelling of diseased joint. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies were included. The detection methods included radioimmunoassay and ELISA and the experimental animal species included rats and rabbits. The studies on serum TNF-α and degree of swelling of diseased joint had publication bias. Meta-analysis showed that the moxibustion group had significant reductions in the serum levels of TNF-α, IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, VEGF, IL-17, and RANKL, significant increases in the serum levels of TGF-β and IFN-γ, and a significant reduction in the degree of swelling of diseased joints in model animals. CONCLUSION: Moxibustion can effectively regulate levels of the serum cytokines in experimental animals of rheumatoid arthritis and thus reduce inflammatory response and alleviate the swelling of diseased joints.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The carotid artery blood flow (CABF) or cerebral blood flow (CBF) achieved with current techniques of cardiac compression in humans are unknown. Animal experiments may provide useful information on such flows and on possible techniques to optimize them. OBJECTIVES: To obtain an estimate of carotid and cerebral blood flows during cardiac compression with different techniques. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of all studies in the English literature that measured the CABF and/or CBF during cardiac compression in experimental models of cardiac arrest, expressed as a percentage of baseline (pre-arrest) values. We compared the effect of vasopressor use, thoracic compression technique, pre-arrest infusion and animal model on maximum blood flows using standard statistical methodologies. RESULTS: Overall, 133 studies were reviewed. Of these, 45 studies provided information only on CABF; 77 only on CBF, and 11 studies on both flows. The overall weighted mean (±SD) CABF was 35.2 ± 27.7\% of baseline. Porcine studies showed lower CABF when vasopressors were used (p = 0.0002). Studies of CBF reported a weighted mean value of 66.5 ± 48.5\% of baseline. Adjunctive vasopressor therapy significantly increased CBF (p = 0.007), as did fluid administration (P = 0.049). In studies reporting both CABF and CBF, the median CABF/CBF ratio was 0.67 (range 0.21-1.96). CONCLUSIONS: During experimental cardiac compression, compared to baseline, CABF appears to decrease much more than CBF. However results should be regarded with caution. They are affected by ancillary interventions and measurement methods, variability is marked and, in experiments measuring CABF and CBF simultaneously, their ratios range well outside physiologically plausible values.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Zoonotic tuberculosis (zTB) accounts for 1.4\% of the global tuberculosis burden, with the largest disease burden in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). These populations have increased exposure to zTB due to livestock rearing practices and raw dairy consumption. This qualitative systematic literature review evaluates the quality of the literature that examines the association between human zTB in LMICs and frequent exposure to livestock and livestock products and summarizes current gaps in laboratory detection methods. METHODS: The Navigation Guide, a systematic review framework utilized to assess environmental health exposures, was used to conduct this literature review. Peer-reviewed research articles were selected and evaluated for risk of bias and quality of evidence. Only studies conducted in LMICs that mentioned livestock or livestock product exposure and had a confirmed diagnosis were eligible. RESULTS: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Reported prevalence of human zTB ranged from 0\% to 28\%, with cattle and raw dairy the primary exposures. All confirmed zTB cases were Mycobacterium bovis. Eight of the 15 studies included livestock sampling, predominantly cattle and reported prevalence of zTB between 0\% and 23\%. Laboratory methods used included nearly a dozen different culture methods and a variety of molecular methods, some of which are not appropriate for zTB. CONCLUSIONS: This review revealed the need for appropriate and standardized laboratory diagnostic methods, and large prospective studies of at-risk populations to determine exposures that lead to an increased risk of tuberculosis conversion/infection to better understand the true burden of disease. Standardized, easy to implement laboratory diagnostics is an imperative focus for this scientific field to better identify the burden of zTB. Future studies pairing livestock and human subjects will allow better characterization of the high zTB transmission areas for targeted control and prevention programmes.},

Two theories for this could be that the lower PPP locations in this study were also in areas of greater feral cat and cat colony populations, as well as were areas with less emphasis on animal welfare and animal control programs.

	abstract = {Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent and aggressive malignant brain tumour, with a poor prognosis despite available surgical and radio-chemotherapy, rising the necessity for searching alternative therapies. Several preclinical studies evaluating the efficacy of cannabinoids in animal models of GBM have been described, but the diversity of experimental conditions and of outcomes hindered definitive conclusions about cannabinoids efficacy. A search in different databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, Scopus and SciELO) was conducted during June 2019 to systematically identify publications evaluating the effects of cannabinoids in murine xenografts models of GBM. The tumour volume and number of animals were extracted, and a random effects meta-analysis of these results was performed to estimate the efficacy of cannabinoids. The impact of different experimental factors and publication bias on the efficacy of cannabinoids was also assessed. Nine publications, which satisfied the inclusion criteria, were identified and subdivided in 22 studies involving 301 animals. Overall, cannabinoid therapy reduced the fold of increase in tumour volume in animal models of GBM, when compared with untreated controls. The overall weighted standardized difference in means (WSDM) for the effect of cannabinoids was -1.399 (95\% CI: -1.900 to -0.898; P-value{\textless}0.0001). Furthermore, treatment efficacy was observed for different types of cannabinoids, alone or in combination, and for different treatment durations. Cannabinoid therapy was still effective after correcting for publication bias. The results indicate that cannabinoids reduce the tumour growth in animal models of GBM, even after accounting for publication bias.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To gain further insight on the association between human toxocariasis and epilepsy in light of the new evidence in the last years. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted without date and language restriction in the following electronic databases: MEDLINE (PubMed), Ingenta Connect, Science Direct (Elsevier), RefDoc, Scopus, HighWire, Scielo and the database of the Institute of Neuroepidemiology and Tropical Neurology of the Limoges University (IENT). Two investigators independently conducted the search up to November 2017. A pooled odds ratio (OR) was estimated using a random effects model. Meta-regression was conducted to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Database search produced 204 publications. Eleven case-control studies were included that were carried out in 13 countries worldwide. A total number of 4740 subjects were considered (2159 people with epilepsy and 2581 people without epilepsy). The overall pooled OR was 1.69 (95\% CI 1.42-2.01) for the association between epilepsy and Toxocara spp. seropositivity. A positive association was constantly reported in the restricted analysis (WB as confirmatory or diagnostic test, younger population, and population-based studies). Meta-regression showed no statistically significant association between covariates and outcome. CONCLUSION: The updated meta-analysis provides epidemiological evidence of a positive association between Toxocara seropositivity and epilepsy. New surveys supported the association, mainly population-based studies. On this basis, health strategies to reduce the impact of Toxocara spp are strongly advised. Further research should be performed to understand the physiopathological mechanisms of toxocara-associated epileptogenesis.},

	abstract = {Several animal and human studies revealed that joint and nerve mobilisations positively influence neuroimmune responses in neuromusculoskeletal conditions. However, no systematic review and meta-analysis has been performed. Therefore, this study aimed to synthesize the effects of joint and nerve mobilisation compared with sham or no intervention on neuroimmune responses in animals and humans with neuromusculoskeletal conditions. Four electronic databases were searched for controlled trials. Two reviewers independently selected studies, extracted data, assessed the risk of bias, and graded the certainty of the evidence. Where possible, meta-analyses using random effects models were used to pool the results. Preliminary evidence from 13 animal studies report neuroimmune responses after joint and nerve mobilisations. In neuropathic pain models, meta-analysis revealed decreased spinal cord levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein, dorsal root ganglion levels of interleukin-1β, number of dorsal root ganglion nonneuronal cells, and increased spinal cord interleukin-10 levels. The 5 included human studies showed mixed effects of spinal manipulation on salivary/serum cortisol levels in people with spinal pain, and no significant effects on serum β-endorphin or interleukin-1β levels in people with spinal pain. There is evidence that joint and nerve mobilisations positively influence various neuroimmune responses. However, as most findings are based on single studies, the certainty of the evidence is low to very low. Further studies are needed.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is a significant source of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and beef cattle are particularly emissions intensive. GHG emissions are typically expressed as a carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) 'carbon footprint' per unit output. The 100-year Global Warming Potential (GWP(100)) is the most commonly used CO(2)e metric, but others have also been proposed, and there is no universal reason to prefer GWP(100) over alternative metrics. The weightings assigned to non-CO(2) GHGs can differ significantly depending on the metric used, and relying upon a single metric can obscure important differences in the climate impacts of different GHGs. This loss of detail is especially relevant to beef production systems, as the majority of GHG emissions (as conventionally reported) are in the form of methane (CH(4)) and nitrous oxide (N(2)O), rather than CO(2). This paper presents a systematic literature review of harmonised cradle to farm-gate beef carbon footprints from bottom-up studies on individual or representative systems, collecting the emissions data for each separate GHG, rather than a single CO(2)e value. Disaggregated GHG emissions could not be obtained for the majority of studies, highlighting the loss of information resulting from the standard reporting of total GWP(100) CO(2)e alone. Where individual GHG compositions were available, significant variation was found for all gases. A comparison of grass fed and non-grass fed beef production systems was used to illustrate dynamics that are not sufficiently captured through a single CO(2)e footprint. Few clear trends emerged between the two dietary groups, but there was a non-significant indication that under GWP(100) non-grass fed systems generally appear more emissions efficient, but under an alternative metric, the 100-year global temperature potential (GTP(100)), grass-fed beef had lower footprints. Despite recent focus on agricultural emissions, this review concludes there are insufficient data available to fully address important questions regarding the climate impacts of agricultural production, and calls for researchers to include separate GHG emissions in addition to aggregated CO(2)e footprints.},

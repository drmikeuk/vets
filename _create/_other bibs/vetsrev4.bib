	abstract = {Through a systematic review of literature comprising publications between 1973 and 2009, the following databases were consulted: Science Direct, EBSCO, Springer Link and MEDLINE. Key words used included stray dogs, animal-human bond, pet population, overpopulation and population control. The databases of the World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA) and the International Organization of Epizootics (OIE) were also consulted. The objective of the present review was to present a critical position about the pet overpopulation problem, cultural perception and relationships between human and animals, and failures associated with this relationship with the purpose of establishing possible solutions to the problem taking into consideration cultural issues. A total of 16 references were found, which, we applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles that met these criteria are those that constitute the unit of analysis of this review. As the knowledge about responsible ownership of pets is increased, the bond with them is enhanced. Only through health education, it is possible to acquire the necessary knowledge needed to avoid failures with respect to proper keeping. In this respect the veterinarian plays a pivotal role with his community.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the methodology for and utilization of tissue oxygen monitoring by near infrared spectroscopy, and to review the current literature on the use of this monitoring modality in human and veterinary settings. DATA SOURCES: Scientific reviews and original research found using the PubMed and CAB Abstract search engines with the following keywords: "tissue oxygen monitoring," "near-infrared tissue spectroscopy," and "tissue oxygen saturation (StO2 )." HUMAN DATA SYNTHESIS: Tissue oxygen monitors have been evaluated in a wide variety of human clinical applications including trauma and triage, surgery, sepsis, and septic shock, and early goal-directed therapy. StO2 more rapidly identifies occult shock in human patients compared to traditional methods, which can lead to earlier intervention in these patients. VETERINARY DATA SYNTHESIS: Veterinary studies involving tissue oxygen monitoring are limited, but the technology may have utility for identification of hemorrhagic shock earlier than changes in base excess, blood lactate concentration, or other traditional perfusion parameters. CONCLUSION: Tissue oxygen monitoring is most commonly performed utilizing a noninvasive, portable monitor, which provides real-time, continuous, repeatable StO2 measurements. A decline in StO2 is an early indicator of shock in both human and veterinary patients. Low StO2 values in human patients are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and length of hospitalization, as well as the development of multiple organ system dysfunction and surgical site infections.},

	abstract = {Dietary vitamin E supplementation provides a feasible option to extend the shelf life of meat. However, the costs of extra supplementation necessitate an accurate level of feeding to achieve the maximum return in product quality improvement. The current study aimed to quantify the effects of total dietary vitamin E intake on muscle alpha-tocopherol concentration in cattle and pigs, and to relate muscle alpha-tocopherol concentration to lipid oxidation and color of meat. Through computerized and manual searches, 13 studies with cattle and 10 with pigs were identified that have presented data on dietary vitamin E intake and muscle alpha-tocopherol concentration. Treatment means from 12 studies with beef and 14 with pork were used to evaluate the effects of muscle alpha-tocopherol concentration on lipid oxidation, as represented by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in meat stored or retail displayed at chilled temperatures. With CIELAB a* (redness) values as an indicator of color development, the association between muscle alpha-tocopherol concentration and color could be evaluated with treatment means from 8 studies with beef and 5 with pork. Different treatments applied within studies resulted in 20 to 66 values available for the respective regression analyses. Relationships could be described effectively by different forms of the Mitscherlich model, which presented an initial value for y when x = 0, an asymptotic plateau, and the rate of change of y with increasing values of x. With the inclusion of experiment as a random effect, the relationship between total dietary vitamin E intake (x, IU/d for cattle and mg/d for pigs) and muscle alpha-tocopherol concentration (y, microg/g of meat) reached asymptotic plateau values at 5.71 and 4.83 microg/g of meat for cattle and pigs, respectively. The fractional accumulation rate (per total dietary vitamin E intake) of muscle alpha-tocopherol concentration was considerably greater in pigs (0.0130) than in cattle (0.00174). The form of the relationship between muscle alpha-tocopherol concentration and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in pork was influenced by a single value, whereas muscle alpha-tocopherol concentrations could not be related to a* values in beef. This study presented viable models that could be applied in practice to calculate the amounts of supplemental dietary vitamin E needed to obtain the maximum profit from beef and pork.},

	abstract = {Technological meat quality is a significant economic factor in pork production, and numerous publications have shown that it is strongly influenced both by genetic status and by rearing and slaughter conditions. The quality of meat is often described by meat pH at different times postmortem, as well as by color and drip loss, whereas carcass quality is often characterized by lean percentage. A meta-analysis of findings relating to 3,530 pigs reported in 23 publications was carried out to assess the effects of the halothane gene, sex, breed, and slaughter weight of animals on 7 selected variables: pH at 45 min postmortem, ultimate pH, reflectance (L*-value), redness (a*-value), yellowness (b*-value), drip loss, and lean percentage. Two statistical methods were used in the meta-analysis: the method of effect size and the better known random effects model. The method of effect size was associated with Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for implementing Bayesian hierarchical models to avoid the problems of limited data and publication bias. The results of our meta-analysis showed that the halothane genotype had a significant effect on all analyzed pork quality variables. Between-study variance was evaluated with the Cochran (1954) Q-test of heterogeneity. Meta-regression was used to explain this variance, with covariates such as breed, sex, slaughter weight, and fasting duration being integrated into different regression models. The halothane gene effect was associated with the breed effect only for the following variables: L*-value, b*-value, and drip loss. Slaughter weight contributed significantly only to the explanation of differences in ultimate pH between homozygous genotypes. In response to inconsistencies reported in the literature regarding the difference between the genotypes NN and Nn, results of the meta-analysis showed that the difference between these 2 genotypes was significant for all the analyzed variables except the a*-value.},

A meta-analysis based on a database built from 27 studies corresponding to a total of 6526 animals classified was carried out. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to study the effect of fasting, lairage and transport durations on four main attributes of the technological pork meat quality. A Bayesian hierarchical meta-regression approach was adopted. The results of our meta-analysis showed that fasting time had a significant effect on pH measured 24h post-mortem (pHu) and drip loss (DL) measured in longissimus muscle. While, lairage affected only the pHu in semimembranosus muscle. Interestingly, we found that DL was the lone attribute that was affected by transport time and its interaction with fasting time.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Occupational exposure to bio-aerosols has been linked to various health effects. This review presents an overview of bio-aerosol exposure levels in veterinary practices, and investigates the possibility of health effects associated with bio-aerosol exposure. METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed. Publications were included if they provided information on bio-aerosol exposure and related health effects through veterinary practice and other professions with similar exposures, occupationally exposed to animals. RESULTS: Few studies in veterinary settings showed that substantial bio-aerosol exposure levels (e.g. endotoxin and beta(1--{\textgreater}3)-glucan) were likely occur when handling farm animals and horses. Exposure levels are comparable to those levels observed in farming which have been associated with respiratory health effects. Animal specific allergen exposures have hardly been studied, but showed to be measurable in companion animal clinics and dairy barns. The Findings of the few studies available among veterinary populations, particularly those working with farm animals and horses, are indicative of an elevated risk for developing respiratory symptoms. Studies among pig farmers, exposed to similar environments as veterinarians, strongly confirm that veterinary populations are at an increased risk of developing respiratory diseases in relation to bio-aerosol exposure, in particular endotoxin. Exposure to animal allergens during veterinary practice may cause allergic inflammation, characterized by IgE-mediated reactions to animal allergens. Nonetheless, the occurrence of sensitization or allergy against animal allergens is poorly described, apart from laboratory animal allergy, especially known from exposure to rats and mice. CONCLUSION: Veterinary populations are likely exposed to elevated levels of bio-aerosols such as endotoxins, beta(1--{\textgreater}3)-glucans, and some specific animal allergens. Exposures to these agents in animal farmers are associated with allergic and non-allergic respiratory effects, proposing similar health effects in veterinary populations.},

The literature search included peer-reviewed journals (both full articles and abstracts), conference proceedings and theses and included documents written in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese or Italian. The study outcome was defined as the difference in milk production (kg/cow per day) between treated and untreated cows. Random effect meta-analyses were performed on 75 trials published between 1972 and 2002. The combined estimate after controlling for publication bias and/or small-study effect was of 0.35 kg/cow per day. Significant variation among studies was detected and although several variables were associated with the study outcome, they did not significantly reduce the unexplained variability among trials. Trials reporting the use of endectocides had higher milk-production response compared with trials using older anthelmintics. Similarly, whole-herd treatment trials or trials which applied the treatment in mid-lactation or strategically throughout the year had higher response compared with calving or dry-period treatment trials. Trials reporting the results as total 305-day milk production had lower response compared with trials which measured production as daily milk weight. Primiparous cows trials had lower responses compared with multiparous cows trials.},

	abstract = {A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to identify study-level variables that could explain the variation in apparent Salmonella spp. prevalence estimates. Electronic and non-electronic literature searches from 1990 until 2005 were carried out to identify all studies related to the prevalence of subclinical Salmonella infection in swine. The searches were restricted to studies published in English, Spanish, and French. Clinical trials or any other study where an intervention was evaluated were excluded from this analysis. A template was designed to retrieve the most relevant variables and data abstraction was performed in duplicate. A total of 98 papers containing 82 animal-level and 156 farm-level studies were used in the analyses. The median farm-level and animal-level prevalences were 59\% and 17\%, respectively. Meta-regression analyses were carried out on both farm and animal-level data. Diagnostic procedure, sample size, and country where study was conducted were the three most important predictors in explaining the differences in Salmonella prevalences between studies. When compared to a farm with a apparent prevalence of 50\% determined by the blood ELISA, prevalences based on culture of fecal samples were 39\% lower and prevalences based on cecum and tissue cultures were 16\% and 19\% lower, respectively. Similar to farm-level models, animal-level models did not show any difference among serological tests and prevalence values based culture procedures were, on average, 9\% lower than those from serological tests. Sample size was negatively associated with prevalence estimates. In conclusion, the methodology was useful for identifying and quantifying sources of variation in Salmonella apparent prevalence among studies and for establishing prevalence distributions that could be used as input parameters in risk assessment and decision models. The analysis provides some guidelines when interpreting and comparing apparent Salmonella prevalence results from studies using different study designs.},

Therefore, a literature search was conducted in Journal of Dairy Science, Theriogenology, Animal Reproduction Science and The Veterinary Journal utilizing the ScienceDirect database. The search revealed 259 articles addressing APM. After applying exclusion criteria, a total of 48 trials remained. It was determined whether the author gave a clear definition of APM, the time of diagnosis relative to calving, and the person who performed the diagnosis. Studies were checked for the presence of definitions of possible findings, thresholds, and test characteristics of the methods used. Overall 9 different diagnostic methods were employed. On average 2.5 +/- 1.75 diagnostic methods were used in a study. References to support the use of the diagnostic methods were provided in 10 of 48 articles (20.8\%). Vaginal discharge, transrectal palpation and rectal temperature were examined in 39, 22, and 21 of the studies, respectively. Thresholds for diagnostic tests and test characteristics were mentioned in 6 and 3 of the 48 articles, respectively. Based on this systematic review of 48 research papers the evidence supporting the use of the diagnostic methods to identify cows with APM has either been not reported or is weak. In conclusion, the reporting of the diagnostic methods to identify cows with APM needs to be improved and further high-quality research is necessary to improve diagnostic performance of the methods employed.},

The methodology consisted of an extensive search to identify all potentially relevant research, screening of titles and abstracts for relevance to the research question, quality assessment of relevant research, extraction of data from research of sufficient quality, and qualitative summarization of results. The interventions evaluated included probiotics, vaccination, antimicrobials, sodium chlorate, bacteriophages and other feed additives. There was evidence of efficacy for the probiotic combination Lactobacillus acidophilus NP51 (NPC 747) and Propionibacterium freudenreichii and for sodium chlorate in feed or water. The effectiveness of vaccination varied among studies and among vaccine protocols and there was no consistent evidence to suggest that antibiotic use was associated with a decrease in faecal shedding of E. coli O157, or that current industry uses of antimicrobials were associated with increased faecal shedding. There were an insufficient number of studies available to address the effectiveness of bacteriophages and several other feed additives. In general, few of the primary studies evaluated the interventions under commercial housing conditions with a natural disease challenge, there were inconsistencies in the results among study designs and in some cases among studies within study designs, and a relatively large proportion of publications were excluded based on quality assessment criteria. Few studies reported on associations between the proposed intervention and production parameters, such as average daily gain and feed: gain ratio. While the results suggest that some interventions may be efficacious, there are knowledge gaps in our understanding of the efficacy of pre-harvest interventions to increase animal resistance to E. coli O157 that require further targeted research.},

METHODS: In the current study, data collection (published and unpublished papers, abstracts of national scientific congresses and dissertations) using particular terms was carried out systematically on the following electronic databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, Ebsco, Science Direct, Scopus, Magiran, Irandoc, IranMedex and SID (Scientific Information Database). RESULTS: A total of 22 studies since 1983 to 2012 reporting the seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in cattle from different regions of Iran met our eligibility criteria. The pooled proportion of toxoplasmosis, using random effect model, among cattle in Iran from over the 30-year period was estimated 18.1\% (95\% CI: 9.9\% to 28.2\%). CONCLUSIONS: This study firstly establishes a crude seroprevalence rate of Toxoplasma infection in cattle which can lead us to understand the condition of cattle toxoplasmosis, which have to take into accounted for an appropriate and effective prevention and controls. Secondly, it compares and discusses elaborately the role of risk factors including sex, age and breed in the epidemiology of the disease. Thus, it determines gaps and drawbacks in the prior studies which are greatly useful to design more accurate investigations in the future.},

	abstract = {Aim: Parasitic infections, especially of the zoonotic-parasitic type, are the most important health, economic, and social problems in developing countries, including Iran. The aim of this study was to review systematically the available data on gastrointestinal parasites of carnivores in Iran and their ability to infect humans. Materials and Methods: Studies reporting intestinal parasites of carnivores were systematically collected from nine electronic English and Persian databases and Proceedings of Iranian parasitology and veterinary congresses published between 1997 and 2015. A total of 26 studies issued from 1997 to 2015 met the eligibility criteria. Results: The pooled proportion of intestinal parasites of carnivores was estimated as 80.4\% (95\% confidence interval=70.2-88.8\%). The overall prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in dogs, cats, foxes, and jackals were 57.89\%, 90.62\%, 89.17\%, and 97.32\%, respectively. Dipylidium caninum (20.45\%), Toxocara spp. (18.81\%), Taenia hydatigena (15.28\%), Mesocestoides lineatus (11.83\%), Echinococcus granulosus (10\%), and Toxascaris leonina (8.69\%) were the most frequently observed parasites. Conclusion: High prevalence rates of zoonotic intestinal parasites of carnivores particularly Echinococcus spp. and Toxocara spp. increase the risk of acquiring zoonotic infections such as cystic hydatid, alveolar cysts, and visceral or ocular larva migrants in Iranian people. Therefore, it is essential for public health centers to develop more effective control strategies to decrease infections rates in carnivores' populations.},

More information obtained with non-invasive measurement techniques to assess normal and abnormal gait in cats would provide a greater insight into their locomotion and biomechanics and improve the objective measurement of disease alterations and treatment modalities. In this systematic review, 12 previously performed studies that investigated ground reaction force measurements in cats during locomotion were evaluated. The aims of these studies, the measurement methods and equipment used, and the outcomes of parameters used to assess both sound and diseased cats are summarised and discussed. All reviewed studies used pressure sensitive walkways to gain data and all provided an acclimatisation period as a prerequisite for measurements. In sound cats during walking, the forelimb peak vertical force was greater than in the hindlimb and the peak vertical force in the hindlimb was greater in cats than in dogs. This review confirms that ground reaction forces can be used to evaluate lameness and treatment effects in the cat.},

We conducted a systematic review of English and Chinese language peer-reviewed and grey literature databases to identify zoonotic endoparasite research utilizing an OH approach in community-based settings. Our review identified 32 articles where specimens collected simultaneously from all three OH domains (people, animals, and the environment) were assessed for endoparasite infection or exposure. Study sites spanned 23 countries, and research teams brought together an average of seven authors from two countries. Surveillance of blood-borne and gastrointestinal protozoa were most frequently reported (19 of 32; 59\%), followed by trematodes, nematodes, and cestodes. Laboratory techniques varied greatly between studies, and only 16 identified parasites using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in all three OH domains. Our review identified important gaps in parasitology research operating under an OH framework. We recommend that investigators working in the realm of zoonotic disease strive to evaluate all three OH domains by integrating modern molecular tools as well as techniques provided by economists and social scientists.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The study of occupational stress and compassion fatigue in personnel working in animal-related occupations has gained momentum over the last decade. However, there remains incongruence in understanding what is currently termed compassion fatigue and the associated unique contributory factors. Furthermore, there is minimal established evidence of the likely influence of these conditions on the health and well-being of individuals working in various animal-related occupations. OBJECTIVE: To assess currently available evidence and terminology regarding occupational stress and compassion fatigue in personnel working in animal shelters, veterinary clinics, and biomedical research facilities. DATA SOURCE: Studies were identified by searching the following electronic databases with no publication date restrictions: ProQuest Research Library, ProQuest Social Science Journals, PsycARTICLES, Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, PsychINFO databases, and Google Scholar. Search terms included (euthanasia AND animals) OR (compassion fatigue AND animals) OR (occupational stress AND animals). STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS: Only articles published in English in peer-reviewed journals that included use of quantitative or qualitative techniques to investigate the incidence of occupational stress or compassion fatigue in the veterinary profession or animal-related occupations were included. On the basis of predefined criteria, 1 author extracted articles, and the data set was then independently reviewed by the other 2 authors. RESULTS: 12 articles met the selection criteria and included a variety of study designs and methods of data analysis. Seven studies evaluated animal shelter personnel, with the remainder evaluating veterinary nurses and technicians (2), biomedical research technicians (1), and personnel in multiple animal-related occupations (2). There was a lack of consistent terminology and agreed definitions for the articles reviewed. Personnel directly engaged in euthanasia reported significantly higher levels of work stress and lower levels of job satisfaction, which may have resulted in higher employee turnover, psychological distress, and other stress-related conditions. LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results of this review suggested a high incidence of occupational stress and euthanasia-related strain in animal care personnel. The disparity of nomenclature and heterogeneity of research methods may contribute to general misunderstanding and confusion and impede the ability to generate high-quality evidence regarding the unique stressors experienced by personnel working with animals. The present systematic review provided insufficient foundation from which to identify consistent causal factors and outcomes to use as a basis for development of evidence-based stress management programs, and it highlights the need for further research.},

METHOD: Selected quantitative studies published in peer-reviewed journals were reviewed for inclusion; the gray literature and white papers were also explored. Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) criteria and Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) were applied to all studies. Fourteen full reports meeting a priori inclusion criteria were extracted from 103 studies accessed through 16 electronic databases and a hand search. Data were synthesized in relation to three research questions informing evidence-based practice. RESULTS: No randomized clinical trials were located. Two studies provided a moderate level of evidence for effectiveness. Nine studies demonstrated statistically significant positive effects. Three studies did not find significant psychosocial effects for the target group, although one found significant positive effects for the comparison group. CONCLUSION: In the aggregate, the evidence is promising in support of the effectiveness of complementary and adjunct interventions employing equines in the treatment of health challenges. Future studies are needed that utilize rigorous and creative designs, especially longitudinal studies and comparisons with established effective treatments.},

This review and meta-analysis study was performed to evaluate the overall prevalence of T. gondii infection among sheep and goats in Iran. Data were systematically collected from 1977 to 2012 in Iran on the following electronic databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, Magiran, Irandoc, IranMedex, and Scientific Information Database (SID). Additionally, abstracts of national scientific congresses and dissertations were included. A total of 34 articles in field of sheep and 18 articles about goat toxoplasmosis, totalizing to the examination of 14,372 sheep and 3,120 goats, reporting prevalence of toxoplasmosis from different regions of Iran fulfilled our eligibility criteria. The overall prevalence rate of toxoplasmosis in Iran was estimated to be 31 \% (95 \% confidence interval (CI) = 0.259825 to 0.352382) in sheep and 27 \% (95 \% CI = 0.140097 to 0.424782) in goats, respectively. There was no significant difference in infection rate between males and females among sheep (odds ratio (OR) = 1.002, 95 \% CI = 0.59 to 1.696) and goats (OR = 1.027, 95 \% CI = 0.685 to 1.541). Analysis revealed that infection rate in sheep over than 1 year old was 2.4 times more than that in less than 1 year old (OR = 2.396, 95 \% CI = 1.050 to 5.467). This systematic review and meta-analysis study revealed that infection is widespread in Iran. Further studies are required to improve strategies for controlling infection among flocks and consequently in human population.},

	abstract = {There is a considerable controversy regarding the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (SWT) in the management of equine orthopaedic diseases. Therefore the aim of this review was a breakdown of current SWT research including technical features, effects on tissue, potential adverse effects and the current clinical evidence for its use in musculoskeletal diseases in horses. Computerised searches were performed using Pub Med, Scopus and Web Spirs databases from 1980 to 2007. The studies were subdivided in equine experimental and clinical studies and classified according to the type of shock waver generator and to the quality of the study design. The search strategy identified a total of 39 studies in horses. These studies could be differentiated into 18 experimental studies and 21 clinical studies. Regarding the experimental studies effects of SWT were described for bone, tendons and nerves with conspicuous differences between different tissues. 61.1\% of the experimental studies showed significant effects after SWT Within the clinical studies effectiveness of SWT ranged from no influence to 100\% of the horses resuming full work. The majority of the clinical studies deals with proximal suspendory disease and navicular disease. 22 studies (56.4\%) used a focused device or extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) and 13 studies (33.3\%) used a nonfocused device or radial pressure wave therapy (RPWT). 4 studies (10.2\%) compared the 2 shock wave devices: 3 of these studies showed no effects neither with ESWT nor with RPWT In the fourth study both devices caused microcracks in bone, but of different kind. The review reveals a great inhomogeneity across studies. Experimental studies show various tissue effects. Within the clinical studies there is a moderate evidence that SWT is effective in PSD and navicular disease. However due of the lack of high quality studies results should be seen with caution.},

The use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) has been identified as a tool to maintain the intestinal microbial balance and to prevent the establishment of opportunistic pathogenic bacterial populations. However, a consensus has not been reached as to whether probiotics may be effective in reducing the prevalence of gastrointestinal diseases in young calves. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the effect of probiotics on diarrhea incidence and the intestinal microbial balance. LAB supplementation has been shown to exert a protective effect and to reduce the incidence of diarrhea (relative risk, RR=0.437, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.251-0.761). In the subanalysis, this protective effect of the probiotics against diarrhea was observed only in trials that used whole milk (RR=0.154, 95\% CI 0.079-0.301) and trials that used multistrain inocula (RR=0.415, 95\% CI 0.227-0.759). Probiotics did not improve the fecal characteristics (standardized mean difference, SMD=-0.4904, 95\% CI -1.011-0.035) and were unable to change the LAB:coliforms ratio (SMD=0.016, 95\% CI -0.701-0.733). Probiotics showed a beneficial impact on the LAB:coliforms ratio in the subanalysis that included trials that used whole milk (SMD=0.780, 95\% CI 0.141-1.418) and monostrain inocula (SMD=0.990, 95\% CI 0.340-1.641). The probability of significant effects (probiotic positive effect) in a new study was {\textgreater}0.70 for diarrhea and fecal consistency. Whole milk feeding improved the action of the probiotic effect on the incidence of diarrhea and LAB:coliforms ratio. The probability to find significant effects in the diarrhea frequency and LAB:coliforms ratio was higher (P{\textgreater}0.85) if the new studies were conducted using whole milk to feed calves. This paper defines the guidelines to standardize the experimental designs of future trials. LAB can be used as growth promoters in calves instead of antibiotics to counteract the negative effects of their widespread use.},

	abstract = {This systematic review aimed to assess the efficacy of sildenafil in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in dogs and, when possible, to propose recommendations for or against its use. Electronic searches were carried out using six international databases. The inclusion criterion was in vivo clinical trials that assessed the efficacy of sildenafil in the treatment of naturally occurring PH. The scoring system was designed to take into account aspects such as the form of distribution and masking of experimental treatments, the number of animals, association with other drugs, diagnostic methods for PH, evaluations of the clinical response to treatment and adverse effects. A total of five papers were found. In general, the clinical condition and quality of life of the animals improved after sildenafil therapy, and the occurrence of adverse effects was uncommon. Echocardiographic findings provided evidence for changes in pulmonary arterial pressure which could be associated with alterations in physical activity and survival time. Still, the methodological quality of the studies was low, only one of them was a randomised, placebo-controlled and double-blind clinical trial. Furthermore, with modest evidence, this study allowed the recommendation that sildenafil is an important therapy which can play a positive therapeutic role in the treatment of canine PH. Additionally, prospective, randomised, blinded and controlled studies with a larger number of animals assessing physical activity and the adverse effects of sildenafil and other drugs in association are recommended to evaluate the efficacy of this drug in dogs.},

To develop more precise estimates of the effects of halofuginone on calf cryptosporidiosis, meta-analyses were performed, including studies on prophylactic and therapeutic treatment. Meta-analysis increases statistical power because several trials are evaluated together, increasing the effective sample size and possibility of detecting true effects. In total, 20 cohort or clinical studies (in 16 publications) investigating halofuginone treatment in calves were identified. One study was excluded because treated calves and control calves were not investigated in parallel. Four studies (three publications) were excluded because only abstracts were available. Thus, 15 studies from 12 publications, with 10-311 calves were included for data extraction. Of these, five studies from three publications could not be used for meta-analysis because they did not report the data needed. Effects on infection prevalence, diarrhoeal prevalence and mortality were investigated. For prophylactic treatment, halofuginone had an effect on infection and diarrhoeal prevalence on study days 4 and 7, but the control group had significantly lower infection prevalence than the halofuginone treated group on study day 21. Heterogeneity was detected on study days 14 and 21 and publication bias was detected on study days 7 and 14. Mortality was not affected. For therapeutic treatment, a shortage of studies in combination with heterogeneity made interpretations uncertain, and we could not determine if halofuginone treatment benefits calves.},

	doi = {10.1111/vec.12282},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review and appraise common vasopressor drugs used to treat septic shock-induced hypotension in volume replete animals. DATA SOURCES: Human and animal publications were searched using PubMed without time limits and the following keywords were used: "vasopressor," "septic shock," "norepinephrine," "dopamine," "epinephrine," and "vasopressin." HUMAN DATA SYNTHESIS: The choice of vasopressor drug is unlikely to have a marked impact on outcome, but the incidence of adverse events (eg, tachycardia) varies greatly between the various treatment options. In agreement with the 2012 Cochrane Database consensus, norepinephrine is the first-choice vasopressor to maintain a mean arterial pressure {\textgreater}/=65 mm Hg. If an additional agent is required, epinephrine should be administered. Low-dose vasopressin can be added to norepinephrine to either increase the arterial blood pressure to the target goal value or decrease the norepinephrine dose, but should not be used as the initial vasopressor. Dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances. VETERINARY DATA SYNTHESIS: There is insufficient evidence to make definitive conclusions regarding the treatment of naturally occurring septic shock, but clinical studies are underway to provide further data. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of hypotension in people or animals with septic shock is challenging and vasopressor therapy is associated with a variety of adverse effects. Further research is warranted in dogs and cats to establish evidence-based guidelines.},

	abstract = {Marine mammals are often cited as "sentinels of ocean health" yet accessible, synthesized data on their health changes that could effectively warn of ocean health changes are rare. The objectives of this study were to 1) perform a systematic review of published cases of marine mammal disease to determine spatial and temporal trends in disease from 1972-2012, including changes in regions and taxa affected and specific causes; and 2) compare numbers of published cases of neoplasia with known, hospital-based neoplasia records to explore the causes of discrepancy between numbers of published cases and true disease trends. Peer-reviewed literature was compiled, and data were collected from The Marine Mammal Center database in Sausalito, California for comparison of numbers of neoplasia cases. Toxicoses from harmful algal blooms appear to be increasing. Viral epidemics are most common along the Atlantic U.S. coastline, while bacterial epidemics, especially leptospirosis, are most common along the Pacific coast. Certain protozoal and fungal zoonoses appear to be emerging, such as Toxoplasma gondii in southern sea otters in California, and Cryptococcus gattii in cetaceans in the Pacific Northwest. Disease reports were most common from California where pinniped populations are large, but increased effort also occurs. Anthropogenic trauma remains a large threat to marine mammal health, through direct mortality and indirect chronic disease. Neoplasia cases were under-reported from 2003-2012 when compared to true number of cases, and over-reported in several years due to case duplication. Peer-reviewed literature greatly underestimates the true magnitude of disease in marine mammals as it focuses on novel findings, fails to reflect etiology of multifactorial diseases, rarely reports prevalence rather than simple numbers of cases, and is typically presented years after a disease first occurs. Thus literature cannot guide management actions adequately, nor inform indices of ocean health. A real-time, nationally centralized system for reporting marine mammal disease data is needed to be able to understand how marine mammal diseases are changing with ecosystem changes, and before these animals can truly be considered 'sentinels of ocean health'.},

It was the aim of this systematic review to assess the effects of oral administration of antimicrobials on the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Escherichia coli (E. coli) from chickens. Moreover, the effects of the administration of more than one antimicrobial and of different dosages were studied. Literature was searched in November 2012 from the electronic databases ISI Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and a national literature database (DIMDI) as well as the database ProQuest LLC. The search was updated in March 2014. Original studies describing a treatment (A) and a control group of either non-treatment (C) or initial value (0) and determining AMR in E. coli at different sample points (SP) were included. The literature search resulted in 35 full text articles on the topic, seven (20\%) of which contained sufficient information on the administered antimicrobial and the impact of treatment on AMR. Most papers described the use of more than one antimicrobial, several dosages, controls (non-treatment or pre-treatment) and measured AMR at different SPs leading to a total of 227 SPs on the impact of the use of antimicrobials on AMR in chickens. 74\% of the SPs (168/227) described a higher AMR-rate in E. coli from treated animals than from controls. After the administration of a single antimicrobial, AMR increased at 72\% of the SPs. Administration of more than one antimicrobial increased AMR at 82\% of the SPs. Higher dosages were associated with similar or higher AMR rates. The limited number of studies for each antimicrobial agent and the high variability in the resistance effect call for more well designed studies on the impact of oral administration on AMR development and spread.},

	abstract = {In light of increasing global protein prices and with the need to reduce environmental impact of contemporary systems of milk production, the current review seeks to assess the feasibility of reducing levels of dietary CP in dairy cow diets. At CP levels between 140 and 220 g/kg DM there is a strong positive relationship between CP concentration and dry matter intake (DMI). However, such effects are modest and reductions in DMI when dietary CP is below 180 g/kg DM can be at least partially offset by improving the digestibility and amino acid profile of the undegradable protein (UDP) component of the diet or by increasing rumen fermentable energy. Level and balance of intestinally absorbable amino acids, in particular methionine and lysine, may become limiting at lower CP concentrations. In general the amino acid composition of microbial protein is superior to that of UDP, so that dietary strategies that aim to promote microbial protein synthesis in the rumen may go some way to correcting for amino acid imbalances in low CP diets. For example, reducing the level of NDF, while increasing the proportion of starch, can lead to improvements in nitrogen (N) utilisation as great as that achieved by reducing dietary CP to below 150 g/kg. A systematic review and meta-analysis of responses to rumen protected forms of methionine and lysine was conducted for early/mid lactation cows fed diets containing 150 g CP/kg DM. This analysis revealed a small but significant (P=0.002) increase in milk protein yield when cows were supplemented with these rumen protected amino acids. Variation in milk and milk protein yield responses between studies was not random but due to differences in diet composition between studies. Cows fed low CP diets can respond to supplemental methionine and lysine so long as DMI is not limiting, metabolisable protein (MP) is not grossly deficient and other amino acids such as histidine and leucine do not become rate limiting. Whereas excess dietary protein can impair reproduction and can contribute to lameness, there is no evidence to indicate that reducing dietary CP levels to around 140 to 150 g CP/kg DM will have any detrimental effect on either cow fertility or health. Contemporary models that estimate MP requirements of dairy cows may require refinement and further validation in order to predict responses with low CP diets.},

DESIGN: Standardized, systematic evaluation of the literature, categorization of relevant articles according to level of evidence and quality, and development of consensus on conclusions for application of the concepts to clinical post-cardiac arrest care. SETTING: Academia, referral practice, and general practice. RESULTS: Fifteen standardized clinical questions important for post-cardiac arrest care were asked and research articles relevant to answering these questions were identified through structured, explicit literature database searches. The majority of these articles report research in species other than dogs or cats or consisted of experimental work in canine cardiac arrest models. Outcome metrics reported in these studies widely varied and ranged from quantification of mechanistic endpoints, such as elaboration of reactive oxygen species, to survival, and functional neurologic outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the near complete absence of clinical veterinary studies, the process allowed the formulation of statements for several postcardiac arrest treatments that were either supportive, such as mild therapeutic hypothermia or controlled reoxygenation, or neutral, such as for mannitol administration or seizure prophylaxis. Evidence grading allowed transparency in regards to the strength of these recommendations. Moreover, numerous knowledge gaps emerged that will allow generation of a road map for progress in veterinary post-cardiac arrest care.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines in reducing faecal shedding of Escherichia coli O157 in ruminants. A systematic search of eight databases and land-grant university research reports using an algorithm adapted from a previous systematic review of pre-harvest interventions against E. coli O157 was conducted to locate all reports of in vivo trials of E. coli O157 vaccines in ruminants published between 1990 and 2010. All located references were screened by two independent reviewers, and data were extracted from all relevant papers, with treatment effect measured in odds ratios. For trials with a faecal prevalence outcome that did not involve mixing of treated and untreated cattle in the same pen, efficacy was explored using random-effects meta-analysis. Funnel plots were used to evaluate publication bias, and random-effects meta-regression was performed to explore heterogeneity. The search located 20 relevant manuscripts which detailed 24 trials and 46 treatment comparisons; all but one trial involved cattle. There were 9 deliberate challenge trials (19 comparisons), and 15 natural exposure trials (27 comparisons). For Type III protein vaccines, there were 9 natural exposure trials detailing 17 comparisons, and meta-analysis of 8 comparisons revealed that vaccine treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in E. coli O157 faecal prevalence [odds ratio (OR)=0.38, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=0.29, 0.51]. Siderophore receptor and porin protein (SRP) vaccines (three trials/four comparisons) also reduced faecal prevalence (OR=0.42, 95\% CI=0.20, 0.61); however, none of the bacterin vaccine trials (n=3, six comparisons) resulted in a statistically significant reduction in prevalence. The results suggest that Type III protein and SRP vaccines significantly reduce faecal shedding in cattle; however, caution should be taken in interpreting the results because of the heterogeneity in the results.},

	abstract = {The aim of this systematic review was to collect data concerning the effects of diets containing GM maize, potato, soybean, rice, or triticale on animal health. We examined 12 long-term studies (of more than 90 days, up to 2 years in duration) and 12 multigenerational studies (from 2 to 5 generations). We referenced the 90-day studies on GM feed for which long-term or multigenerational study data were available. Many parameters have been examined using biochemical analyses, histological examination of specific organs, hematology and the detection of transgenic DNA. The statistical findings and methods have been considered from each study. Results from all the 24 studies do not suggest any health hazards and, in general, there were no statistically significant differences within parameters observed. However, some small differences were observed, though these fell within the normal variation range of the considered parameter and thus had no biological or toxicological significance. If required, a 90-day feeding study performed in rodents, according to the OECD Test Guideline, is generally considered sufficient in order to evaluate the health effects of GM feed. The studies reviewed present evidence to show that GM plants are nutritionally equivalent to their non-GM counterparts and can be safely used in food and feed.},

Vaccine types were grouped into 11 or 10 categories based on the subunit content in each preparation for the first and second analysis, respectively. The least-squares means of the postchallenge lung-lesion scores of each vaccine type were then compared after controlling for all the other variables in an analysis of variance using Fischer's protected least significant difference. The statistical analysis was done using a general linear models procedure. Protective indices for each vaccine type were calculated as a function of independent probabilities of protection among vaccinates and controls, and were then compared in a similar model. Cattle vaccinated with live vaccines had the smallest lung-lesion scores (9+or-8) which significantly differed from that of controls (44+or-8), bacterins (23+or-6) and live streptomycin dependent (Sm[super:D], 38+or-12) or modified live (31+or-10). KSCN extract (9+or-10), bacterin, and culture supernatant (CS, 20+or-9) also had significantly lower lung-lesion scores compared to controls. The CS and KSCN vaccines showed a significantly better protective index (PI, 0.70 and 0.68, respectively) than bacterins (0.50) or bacterin + CS (0.44) vaccines. Saline extract and live vaccines had better PI (0.60 and 0.70, respectively) compared to bacterins.},

Design-Meta-analysis. Sample-26 studies published in peer-reviewed journals or reviewed by a regulatory agency. Procedures-To be included, a study had to involve the use of the rbST-Zn formulation available to US producers in accordance with the label instructions for treatment initiation (57 to 70 days postpartum), dose (500 mg, q 14 d), and route (SC). Results-For cows treated with rbST-Zn, mean milk, 3.5\% fat-corrected milk, fat, and protein yields were increased by 4.00, 4.04, 0.144, and 0.137 kg/d (8.8, 8.89, 0.32, and 0.30 lb/d), respectively; however, the concentration of milk components did not change. Pregnancy proportion for the first 2 breeding cycles was increased by 5.4\%, and pregnancy proportion for the duration of the trial was reduced by 5.5\% for rbST-Zn-treated cows, compared with proportions for untreated cows. Mean body condition score (1 to 5 scale) was reduced by 0.06 points during the period of rbST-Zn use for treated cows. Administration of rbST-Zn had no effect on milk somatic cell count, the number of days to pregnancy, or inseminations per pregnancy; rates of fetal loss, twins, cystic ovaries, clinical lameness, lameness lesions, or traumatic lesions of the integumentary system; and odds of clinical mastitis or culling. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results indicated that rbST-Zn administration to dairy cows effectively increases milk production with no adverse effects on cow health and well-being.},

Furthermore, German journals were surveyed for relevant papers. RESULTS: A total of 16 publications concerning the subject were found: ten expert opinions, three case series and three cohort studies. CONCLUSION: Publications on "coat changes in castrated bitches" are rare. The contemporary literature is predominantly comprised of expert opinions and is therefore of little evidentiary value. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Because coat changes following spaying in bitches are often described, dog owners should be informed about these possible secondary effects after spaying. Analysis of frequency and promotive factors with high evidentiary value are still lacking. Consequently, it is difficult or impossible to predict the individual risk of a dog developing coat changes.},

Treatment duration varied from 2 weeks to 6 months. For safety analysis, data were available from 660 dogs. Lesion scores were improved from baseline in the range of 30-52\%, 53-84\% and 52-69\% after 4, 6 and 16 weeks, respectively. The percentage of dogs with only mild pruritus rose from 0-13\% at inclusion to 32-59\% and 46-90\% after 4 and 12 weeks, respectively. In most studies, the frequency of CsA administration could be reduced to every other day in 40\% to 50\% of patients after 4 weeks and to twice weekly in 20-26\% of the dogs after 12-16 weeks. Meta-analysis confirmed highly significant effects of CsA compared to placebo, but none between oral CsA and glucocorticoids. The initial disease severity, age or body weight of subjects did not influence treatment success. Improvement by more than 50\% over baseline of lesion scores was predictive of a better response during treatment maintenance. Vomiting and soft stools/diarrhoea were the most frequent adverse events seen at least once during the studies. These occurred in 25\% and 15\% of subjects, respectively. The frequency of each other type of adverse events was lower than 2.1\%. In summary, the administration of CsA for the treatment of canine AD was found to be as effective as that of glucocorticoids, and adverse effects were minimal.},

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of furosemide to reduce the severity or frequency of detection of EIPH in Thoroughbred racehorses. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analysis. METHODS: Primary studies were identified via searches of electronic databases, relevant texts and reference lists of published articles. Studies were not restricted by date or publication status. Only studies published in English were eligible for inclusion. Searches were performed using a predetermined search string. Randomised controlled trials and non randomised trials were included. Three authors independently assessed each study using the Cochrane collaboration guidelines and GRADE recommendations of rating quality of evidence. Meta-analysis of studies was performed with pooled data to determine if furosemide reduced the frequency of detection of EIPH (yes or no) as evaluated by tracheobronchoscopy or bronchoalveolar RBC number, or if furosemide reduced the severity of EIPH by at least one tracheobronchoscopic grade. RESULTS: Seventeen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The relative risk (RR) of detecting any EIPH by tracheobronchoscopy after administration of furosemide was 0.88 (pooled data from 11 studies, n = 5780; 95\% CI 0.79 – 0.97, p = 0.01). When data from only high quality RCTs (2 studies, n = 405) were used, the RR of detecting endoscopically evident EIPH was 0.69 (95\% CI 0.61 – 0.76, p{\textless}0.001). The proportion of horses previously diagnosed with EIPH having a reduction of at least one EIPH grade after furosemide was 0.68 (2 studies, n = 405; 95\% CI 61 – 76\%). CONCLUSIONS: There is high quality evidence, albeit limited, that administration of furosemide reduces the incidence and severity of EIPH in Thoroughbred or Standardbred racehorses.},

METHOD: Electronic searches of PubMed, MEDLINE and CAB Direct were carried out (25 May 2011) without date or language restrictions. Proceedings of ESVD/ECVD, AAVD/ACVD, NAVDF and WCVD annual congresses were searched. Unpublished studies were sought via the Veterinary Dermatology discussion list and Veterinary Information Network. RESULTS: Seventeen full-length, peer-reviewed controlled trials reporting clinical outcomes of systemic antimicrobial treatment for canine pyoderma were identified. Outcomes specific to superficial or deep pyoderma were reported in nine and five studies, respectively. Five studies reported outcomes only for nondifferentiated pyoderma depth. Heterogeneity of study designs and outcome measures made meta-analysis inappropriate. A good level of evidence was identified supporting the high efficacy of subcutaneously injected cefovecin in superficial pyoderma and for oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in deep pyoderma. A fair level of evidence was identified for moderate to high efficacy of oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clindamycin, cefadroxil, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and sulfadimethoxine-ormetoprim in superficial pyoderma and oral pradofloxacin, oral cefadroxil and subcutaneously injected cefovecin in deep pyoderma. Eleven trials reported observations of adverse effects in treated pyoderma cases by intervention group; four dogs were withdrawn owing to the severity of adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for greater numbers of adequately sized, blinded, randomized controlled trials evaluating systemic antimicrobial interventions for canine pyoderma. Improved differentiation between superficial and deep pyoderma in outcome reporting, outcome measure standardization and association of outcomes with causative bacterial species and their resistance patterns are required.},

Meta-analysis of the results from different publications rather than a narrative review may provide a current status of this technology in buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). In order to gain an idea of the factors affecting the IVF in buffalo, a review of the various studies conducted on buffalo IVF and a meta-analysis of their findings was undertaken. More than 100 articles published from 1991 to 2008 were searched, and results were subjected to meta-analysis to determine the treatment variations without any bias. Thirty factors affecting in vitro embryo production in buffalo were considered. Initially, both fixed- and random-effect models were used. We did not observe any heterogeneity between the studies. Thereafter, all the studies were pooled using the fixed-effect model for analysis. Our analysis suggested that good buffalo oocytes with more than three to five cumulus layers recovered from large-sized follicles in cold seasons when cultured in TCM-199 supplemented with serum, follicle-stimulating hormone, and cysteamine resulted in maximum maturation rate and subsequent embryonic development after insemination. The values obtained in the current study may be considered for a simulation model in establishing a cost-effective suitable method for buffalo IVF in further planned research.},

	abstract = {The zoo scientific community was among the first to focus attention on captivity-induced stereotypic behaviors, their causes, and methods of eradication. Environmental enrichment has emerged recently as the main husbandry tool for tackling this problem. An increasing number of research publications have attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of enrichment in reducing stereotypic behavior and to develop further concepts to explain how effective enrichment works. A review and meta-analysis of this literature indicates that enrichment is a successful technique for reducing stereotypic behavior in zoo animals. Enrichment was associated with significant reduction in stereotypy performance about 53\% of the time. Published enrichment and stereotypy research is lacking for most zoo species, with most studies on large, charismatic, and often endangered species, but it is unclear whether stereotypies are more prevalent in these species. In addition, problems with scientific methods and data presentation, quantitatively detailed in this work, severely limit the conclusions drawn from zoo research. Further understanding of what kinds of enrichment works and what doesn't will require greater attention to experimental design, sample size, statistical analysis, and better descriptions of enrichment properties and the form of stereotypy. We recommend that future studies focus on increasing sample size (e.g., through multi-institutional studies), appropriate repeated measures design (e.g., with multiple baseline and experimental phases), providing full statistical information about the behavioral changes observed (including standard error), and ultimately the development of a predictive science for enrichment, stereotypies, and wellbeing.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment of dogs with primary immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) is difficult and frequently unrewarding. Prognostic factors have been evaluated in a number of previous studies, and identification of such factors would be beneficial to enable selection of appropriate therapeutic regimens and supportive care. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the current study was to undertake a critical appraisal of the risk of bias in evidence relating to prognostic indicators for mortality in dogs with IMHA. ANIMALS: Three hundred and eighty client-owned dogs with spontaneous primary idiopathic IMHA reported in 6 previous studies. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to evaluate evidence relating to prognostic factors for mortality in dogs with primary IMHA. Search tools were employed to identify articles and a validated appraisal tool was used to assess the quality of individual studies by considering inclusion and exclusion criteria, measurement of prognostic, outcome and confounding variables, and statistical methods. RESULTS: Few studies evaluated prognostic indicators for IMHA in dogs, and all of these suffered from methodologic flaws in at least 1 major area. Fifteen different variables were identified as prognostic indicators, with 2 variables identified by {\textgreater}1 study. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: There are few pieces of high-quality evidence available to enable estimation of prognosis for dogs presenting with primary IMHA.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to assess the heterogeneities of estimates and to estimate the seroprevalence of brucellosis in animals and humans in Ethiopia. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Data from 70 studies covering 75879 animals and 2223 humans were extracted. Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) and Complement Fixation Test (CFT) in series were the most frequently used serological tests. A random effects model was used to calculate pooled prevalence estimates. The overall True Prevalence of brucellosis seropositivity in goats and sheep were estimated at 5.3\% (95\%CI = 3.5, 7.5) and 2.7\% (95\%CI = 1.8, 3.4), respectively, and 2.9\% for each of camels and cattle. The prevalence was higher in post-pubertal than in pre-pubertal animals (OR = 3.1, 95\% CI = 2.6, 3.7) and in the pastoral than in the mixed crop-livestock production system (OR = 2.8, 95\%CI = 2.5, 3.2). The incidence rates of brucellosis in humans of pastoral and sedentary system origins were estimated at 160 and 28 per 100 000 person years, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The seroprevalence of brucellosis is higher in goats than in other species. Its occurrence is evocative of its importance in the country in general and in the pastoral system in particular. Public awareness creation could reduce the transmission of Brucella spp. from animals to humans and the potential of livestock vaccination as a means of control of brucellosis needs to be assessed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The emergence and spread of drug resistant Salmonellae of both human and animal origins are global concerns and worrisome in countries where the risk of infection is high and treatment options are limited. The objective of this study was to estimate the proportions of animal isolates resistant to antimicrobials used against human salmonellosis in Ethiopia. METHODS: Published studies on the antimicrobial resistance features of Salmonellae isolated from food animals of Ethiopia were searched in Medline, Google Scholar and the lists of references of articles. Eligible studies were selected by using inclusion and exclusion criteria and data were extracted. The extracted data included the host species, the numbers of isolates and the numbers of ampicillin, co-trimoxazole, chloramphenicol, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin resistant isolates. The risks of bias were assessed and the percentages of the variations of the estimates attributable to heterogeneities were quantified. Pooled proportions were estimated by the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. RESULTS: Five hundred and fifty four Salmonellae isolated from cattle, camels, sheep, goats and pigs were tested with a variety of antimicrobials. The percentages of the variations attributable to heterogeneities were low for chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone (I(2) = 0) and high for ampicillin, co-trimoxazole and ciprofloxacin resistance estimates (I(2) {\textgreater} 75\%). The pooled estimate of ampicillin resistant isolates was higher in slaughtered ruminants (17.28\%) than in pigs (3.95\%), (p {\textless} 0.001). The pooled estimates of co-trimoxazole resistant isolates in true ruminants (4.35\%) and pigs (1.12\%) were not significantly different (p {\textgreater} 0.05). The overall pooled estimates of chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone resistant isolates were 2.24\% and 1.25\%, respectively. Seven serotypes have been reported to be resistant to antimicrobials uncommonly used in veterinary clinical practice in Ethiopia. CONCLUSIONS: Among Salmonellae of farm animals, there exist strains that are resistant to drugs used in the therapeutic management of human salmonellosis in Ethiopia. Intervention measures should be taken to ensure the prudent use of antimicrobials and curb the spread of high risk strains across the country.},

	abstract = {Background: Antibiotic use in human medicine, veterinary medicine, and agriculture has been linked to the rise of antibiotic resistance globally. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarise the effect that interventions to reduce antibiotic use in food-producing animals have on the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in animals and in humans. Methods: On July 14, 2016, we searched electronic databases (Agricola, AGRIS, BIOSIS Previews, CAB Abstracts, MEDLINE, Embase, Global Index Medicus, ProQuest Dissertations, Science Citation Index) and the grey literature. The search was updated on Jan 27, 2017. Inclusion criteria were original studies that reported on interventions to reduce antibiotic use in food-producing animals and compared presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria between intervention and comparator groups in animals or in human beings. We extracted data from included studies and did meta-analyses using random effects models. The main outcome assessed was the risk difference in the proportion of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Findings: A total of 181 studies met inclusion criteria. Of these, 179 (99\%) described antibiotic resistance outcomes in animals, and 81 (45\%) of these studies were included in the meta-analysis. 21 studies described antibiotic resistance outcomes in humans, and 13 (62\%) of these studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled absolute risk reduction of the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in animals with interventions that restricted antibiotic use commonly ranged between 10 and 15\% (total range 0-39), depending on the antibiotic class, sample type, and bacteria under assessment. Similarly, in the human studies, the pooled prevalence of antibiotic resistance reported was 24\% lower in the intervention groups compared with control groups, with a stronger association seen for humans with direct contact with food-producing animals. Interpretation: Interventions that restrict antibiotic use in food-producing animals are associated with a reduction in the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in these animals. A smaller body of evidence suggests a similar association in the studied human populations, particularly those with direct exposure to food-producing animals. The implications for the general human population are less clear, given the low number of studies. The overall findings have directly informed the development of WHO guidelines on the use of antibiotics in food-producing animals. Funding: World Health Organization.},

Design-Systematic review and meta-analysis. Sample-31 studies comprising 88 trials. Procedures-Studies that reported the effectiveness of commercially available bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), and parainfluenza type 3 virus (PI3) vaccines for protection of cattle against BRDC or its components were included in the analysis. Studies or trials were categorized as natural exposure or experimental challenge and were further divided by the viral antigen evaluated and vaccine type (modified-live virus [MLV] or inactivated vaccine). Meta-analysis was performed; summary Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios were determined, and Forest plots were generated. Results-In natural exposure trials, beef calves vaccinated with various antigen combinations had a significantly lower BRDC morbidity risk than did nonvaccinated control calves. In trials evaluating BHV-1 and MLV BVDV vaccines in experimental challenge models, vaccinated calves had a lower BRDC morbidity risk than did control calves; however, in experimental challenge trials evaluating MLV BRSV and PI3 vaccines, no significant difference in morbidity or mortality risk was found between vaccinated and control calves. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Estimating clinical efficacy from results of experimental challenge studies requires caution because these models differ substantially from those involving natural exposure. The literature provides data but does not provide sufficiently strong evidence to guide definitive recommendations for determining which virus components are necessary to include in a vaccination program for prevention or mitigation of BRDC in cattle.},

The meta-analysis was conducted to 1) develop prediction equations for sweating and respiration rate (SR, g.m(-2).h(-1) and RR, breaths.min(-1), respectively) based on skin and body temperature (T(s) and T(b), degrees C, respectively) for different breed types: Bos indicus, Bos taurus, and their crossbreds, and 2) evaluate the fit of existing SR equations and the SR and RR equations (from objective 1) against independent data sets. Fourteen studies were collected for the SR analysis, 12 for fitting and 2 for evaluation. The fitted SR equations (Thompson model) for the 3 breeds types were B. indicus, SR = 0.085e(0.22.T(s)); B. taurus, SR = 0.75e(0.15.T(s)); and crossbreds, SR = 0.015e(0.25.T(s)). Twenty-three studies were collected for the RR analysis, 20 for fitting and 3 for evaluation. The fitted RR equations for the 3 breed types were B. indicus, RR = -1,660 + 43.8.T(b); B. taurus, RR = -1,385 + 37.T(b); and crossbreds, RR = -2,226 + 59.T(b). Three SR equations (Maia, McArthur, and Gatenby models) from the literature were evaluated against the Thompson model using the 14 studies. The McArthur model predicted SR within the correct range, but with an increased slope bias because the equation was linear and not the correct shape. The Maia model overpredicted SR for all breed types with the greatest overprediction being for crossbreds. The Gatenby model overpredicted SR for B. taurus (root mean square error of prediction = 506 g.m(-2).h(-1)), but was the best predictor for B. indicus. The Thompson model overpredicted SR for B. indicus (root mean square error of prediction ranged from 134 to 265 g.m(-2).h(-1)), but was the best predictor for B. taurus and crossbreds. The Thompson model was a good predictor for RR across all breed types. The meta-analysis showed that the Thompson model outperformed previous models for both RR and SR with the exception of the SR of B. indicus, which was best predicted by the Gatenby model.},

	abstract = {Digital dermatitis is a major problem in modern dairy production because of decreased animal welfare and financial losses. Individual cow treatments are often seen as too time consuming by farmers, and walk-through hoof baths have therefore been used extensively to control digital dermatitis. For decades, copper sulfate hoof baths have been used to treat and prevent digital dermatitis. Copper sulfate has been referred to as the industry gold standard when it comes to hoof-bath chemicals. In several scientific studies testing the efficacy of other hoof-care products, copper sulfate has been used as a positive control, thereby indicating that copper sulfate has a known positive effect. However, this may not be the case. A dilemma may exist between (1) copper sulfate generally being perceived as being effective against digital dermatitis and (2) a possible lack of well-documented scientific evidence of this effect. The objective of this study was to evaluate the existing scientific literature to determine whether the efficacy of copper sulfate used in hoof baths against digital dermatitis has in fact been demonstrated scientifically. A systematic literature search identified 7 peer-reviewed journal articles describing the efficacy of copper sulfate in hoof baths as treatment or prevention of bovine digital dermatitis. Only 2 of the 7 studies compared copper sulfate to a negative control; most studies were relatively small, and often no clear positive effect of copper sulfate was demonstrated. In conclusion, the frequent claim that copper sulfate is widely reported to be effective is supported by little scientific evidence. Well-designed clinical trials evaluating the effect of copper sulfate against digital dermatitis compared with a negative control are needed. Until such studies have been made, the efficacy of copper sulfate in hoof baths against digital dermatitis remains largely unproven.},

	abstract = {Diagnosis of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in beef cattle placed in feedlots is typically based on clinical illness (CI) detected by pen-checkers. Unfortunately, the accuracy of this diagnostic approach (namely, sensitivity [Se] and specificity [Sp]) remains poorly understood, in part due to the absence of a reference test for ante-mortem diagnosis of BRD. Our objective was to pool available estimates of CI's diagnostic accuracy for BRD diagnosis in feedlot beef cattle while adjusting for the inaccuracy in the reference test. The presence of lung lesions (LU) at slaughter was used as the reference test. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify research articles comparing CI detected by pen-checkers during the feeding period to LU at slaughter. A hierarchical Bayesian latent-class meta-analysis was used to model test accuracy. This approach accounted for imperfections of both tests as well as the within and between study variability in the accuracy of CI. Furthermore, it also predicted the SeCI and SpCI for future studies. Conditional independence between CI and LU was assumed, as these two tests are not based on similar biological principles. Seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. Estimated pooled SeCI and SpCI were 0.27 (95\% Bayesian credible interval: 0.12-0.65) and 0.92 (0.72-0.98), respectively, whereas estimated pooled SeLU and SpLU were 0.91 (0.82-0.99) and 0.67 (0.64-0.79). Predicted SeCI and SpCI for future studies were 0.27 (0.01-0.96) and 0.92 (0.14-1.00), respectively. The wide credible intervals around predicted SeCI and SpCI estimates indicated considerable heterogeneity among studies, which suggests that pooled SeCI and SpCI are not generalizable to individual studies. In conclusion, CI appeared to have poor Se but high Sp for BRD diagnosis in feedlots. Furthermore, considerable heterogeneity among studies highlighted an urgent need to standardize BRD diagnosis in feedlots.},

The objective of this review was to assess the evidence base for the management of extrahepatic CPSS in dogs. An online bibliographic search was performed in November 2010 to identify articles relating to the question "Which of the treatment options for extrahepatic CPSS in dogs offers the best short- and long-term outcomes?" Articles were assigned a level of evidence based on a modified grading system. Thirty-eight articles were included in the review. Thirty-six articles were classified as grade 4 and two as grade 5. The timings and methods of assessment of short- and long-term outcomes varied widely between studies. One prospective study (grade 4a) showed that surgically treated dogs survived significantly longer than medically treated dogs. Four retrospective studies (grade 4b) compared the outcome of two surgical techniques but there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in terms of complications or outcome. The review found that the evidence base for the treatment of extrahepatic CPSS is weak. There is a lack of evidence of short- and long-term outcomes to recommend one treatment over another.},

	abstract = {Recent international developments in the area of infectious disease control and nontariff trade barriers, along with possible zoonotic concerns, have provoked a revival of interest in Johne's disease in Canada and elsewhere. The bacterium causing Johne's disease, Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, is distributed worldwide and causes chronic granulomatous enteritis, also known as paratuberculosis, in domestic and exotic ruminants, including cattle. The subclinical form of this disease results in progressive weight loss, reduced milk production, lower slaughter value, and premature culling, with possible impacts on fertility and udder health. Eventually, infection can lead to the clinical form that manifests as chronic diarrhea, emaciation, debilitation, and eventual death. Currently, available tests to detect infected animals produce many false-negative results and some false-positives, particularly in subclinically infected animals, thus making their interpretation and utilization challenging in control programs. The objective of this 2-part review is to critically review the literature about Johne's disease in dairy cattle for bovine practitioners in Canada. Part I covers the clinical stages, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and prevalence of infection in Canada, while Part II discusses impacts, risk factors, and control programs relevant to Canadian dairy farms. By reviewing the scientific literature about Johne's disease, control of the disease could be pursued through informed implementation of rational biosecurity efforts and the strategic use of testing and culling.},

	abstract = {In human medicine, the information infrastructure that supports the knowledge translation processes of exchange, synthesis, dissemination, and application of the best clinical intervention research has developed significantly in the past 15 years, facilitating the uptake of research evidence by clinicians as well as the practice of evidence-based medicine. Seven of the key elements of this improved information infrastructure are clinical trial registries, research reporting standards, systematic reviews, organizations that support the production of systematic reviews, the indexing of clinical intervention research in MEDLINE, clinical search filters for MEDLINE, and point-of-care decision support information resources. The objective of this paper is to describe why these elements are important for evidence-based medicine, the key developments and issues related to these seven information infrastructure elements in human medicine, how these 7 elements compare with the corresponding infrastructure elements in veterinary medicine, and how all of these factors affect the translation of clinical intervention research into clinical practice. A focused search of the Ovid MEDLINE database was conducted for English language journal literature published between 2000 and 2010. Two bibliographies were consulted and selected national and international Web sites were searched using Google. The literature reviewed indicates that the information infrastructure supporting evidence-based veterinary medicine practice in all of the 7 elements reviewed is significantly underdeveloped in relation to the corresponding information infrastructure in human medicine. This lack of development creates barriers to the timely translation of veterinary medicine research into clinical practice and also to the conduct of both primary clinical intervention research and synthesis research.},

Multiple correspondence analysis and log-linear regression methods were used to establish the relationships between the studied variables and the number of PCV2 infected pigs that developed PMWS. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, the most successful animal experiment aimed to develop PMWS should include: (1) colostrum-deprived pigs, (2) age of inoculation below 3 weeks, (3) high doses of PCV2 inoculum, (4) PCV2 strain from genotype 1, and (5) co-infection with another swine pathogen as a triggering factor.},

	abstract = {The goal of the REFLECT Statement (Reporting guidElines For randomized controLled trials in livEstoCk and food safeTy) (published in 2010) was to provide the veterinary research community with reporting guidelines tailored for randomized controlled trials for livestock and food safety. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of REFLECT Statement reporting of items 1-19 in controlled trials published in journals between 1970 and 2017 examining the comparative efficacy of FDA-registered antimicrobials against naturally acquired BRD (bovine respiratory disease) in weaned beef calves in Canada or the USA, and to compare the prevalence of reporting before and after 2010, when REFLECT was published. We divided REFLECT Statement, items 3, 5, 10, and 11 into subitems, because each dealt with multiple elements requiring separate assessment. As a result, 28 different items or subitems were evaluated independently. We searched MEDLINE((R)) and CABI (CAB Abstracts((R)) and Global Health((R))) (Web of Science) in April 2017 and screened 2327 references. Two reviewers independently assessed the reporting of each item and subitem. Ninety-five references were eligible for the study. The reporting of the REFLECT items showed a point estimate for the prevalence ratio {\textgreater}1 (i.e. a higher proportion of studies published post-2010 reported this item compared to studies published pre-2010), apart from items 10.3, i.e., item 10, subitem 3 (who assigned study units to the interventions), 13 (the flow of study units through the study), 16 (number of study units in analysis), 18 (multiplicity), and 19 (adverse effects). Fifty-three (79\%) of 67 studies published before 2010 and all 28 (100\%) papers published after 2010 reported using a random allocation method in either the title, abstract, or methods (Prevalence ratio=1.25; 95\% CI (1.09,1.43)). However, 8 studies published prior to 2010 and 7 studies published post-2010 reported the term "systematic randomization" or variations of this term (which is not true randomization) to describe the allocation procedure. Fifty-five percent (37/67) of studies published pre-2010 reported blinding status (blinded/not blinded) of outcome assessors, compared to 24/28 (86\%) of studies published post-2010 (Prevalence ratio=1.5, 95\% CI (1.19, 2.02)). The reporting of recommended items in journal articles in this body of work is generally improving; however, there is also evidence of confusion about what constitutes a random allocation procedure, and this suggests an educational need. As this study is observational, this precludes concluding that the publication of the REFLECT Statement was the cause of this trend.},

	abstract = {Our objective was to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination and biosecurity on the prevalence of \_Salmonella\_ spp. in broiler chickens using systematic review and meta-analysis. A comprehensive search of the global primary literature was conducted in: Current Contents (1999-2009), Agricola (1924-2009), MEDLINE (1860-2009), Scopus (1960-2009), CAB (1913-2009), and Centre for Agricultural Bioscience Global Health (1971-2009). The search algorithm was (Salmonell*) AND (chicken* OR chick* OR poultry* OR broiler* OR gallus*). Additional studies were identified by contacting five topic experts and hand-scanning bibliographies of recent review articles and a recently published textbook. Studies were included if they were English language and investigated the effects of vaccination and biosecurity on the prevalence of \_Salmonella\_ spp. in broiler chickens. All study design types were included. Data extraction and methodological assessment were conducted by two reviewers independently. All meta-analyses were based on random-effects models. For biosecurity, sixteen challenge studies (\_n\_=137 treatment-control comparisons) and one controlled study (\_n\_=2) met the inclusion criteria. Significant heterogeneity (Cochran's \_Q\_-statistic, \_p\_{\textless}0.001) was observed among biosecurity challenge studies examining hydrogen peroxide or polyhexamethylenebiguanide hydrochloride applied to hatching eggs, making it inappropriate to present a summary effects measure. For vaccination, 19 challenge studies (\_n\_=226) and three controlled studies (\_n\_=10) met the inclusion criteria. Among live \_Salmonella\_ Typhimurium vaccine challenge studies heterogeneity was not significant (\_p\_=0.138). Vaccination with a live \_Salmonella\_ Typhimurium reduced the risk of \_Salmonella\_ cecal colonization in the treated broiler group by 35 out of 1000 broilers when compared to the control group (OR=0.21; 95\% CI=0.06-0.77) and this effect was significant (\_p\_=0.018). One biosecurity study (\_n\_=2 treatment-control comparisons) and three vaccination studies (\_n\_=10) were conducted in a commercial setting. The two included studies in the vaccination meta-analysis were both conducted at research facilities. The live \_Salmonella\_ Typhimurium vaccine showed the most promise in reducing the prevalence of \_Salmonella\_ in broiler ceca. However, the meta-analysis included few studies, and these studies challenged the birds with different serotypes. We recommend that more large-scale randomized, blinded trials be conducted with a live \_Salmonella\_ Typhimurium vaccine on commercial farms.},

Our objectives were to determine the efficacy of feed and water additives (other than competitive exclusion and antimicrobials) on reducing Salmonella prevalence or concentration in broiler chickens using systematic review-meta-analysis and to explore sources of heterogeneity found in the meta-analysis through meta-regression. Six electronic databases were searched (Current Contents (1999-2009), Agricola (1924-2009), MEDLINE (1860-2009), Scopus (1960-2009), Centre for Agricultural Bioscience (CAB) (1913-2009), and CAB Global Health (1971-2009)), five topic experts were contacted, and the bibliographies of review articles and a topic-relevant textbook were manually searched to identify all relevant research. Study inclusion criteria comprised: English-language primary research investigating the effects of feed and water additives on the Salmonella prevalence or concentration in broiler chickens. Data extraction and study methodological assessment were conducted by two reviewers independently using pretested forms. Seventy challenge studies (n=910 unique treatment-control comparisons), seven controlled studies (n=154), and one quasi-experiment (n=1) met the inclusion criteria. Compared to an assumed control group prevalence of 44 of 1000 broilers, random-effects meta-analysis indicated that the Salmonella cecal colonization in groups with prebiotics (fructooligosaccharide, lactose, whey, dried milk, lactulose, lactosucrose, sucrose, maltose, mannanoligosaccharide) added to feed or water was 15 out of 1000 broilers; with lactose added to feed or water it was 10 out of 1000 broilers; with experimental chlorate product (ECP) added to feed or water it was 21 out of 1000. For ECP the concentration of Salmonella in the ceca was decreased by 0.61 log(10)cfu/g in the treated group compared to the control group. Significant heterogeneity (Cochran's Q-statistic p{\textless}/=0.10) was observed among studies examining all organic acids (controlled or challenge experiments), butyric acid, formic acid, a formic/propionic acid mixture, fermented liquid feed, and D-mannose. Meta-regressions were conducted to examine the source of heterogeneity among studies. For prevalence outcomes, 36\% and 60\% of the total variance was within and between studies, respectively. For concentration outcomes, 39\% and 33\% of the total variance was within and between studies, respectively. Inadequate blinding and randomization was common, and no studies undergoing meta-analysis or meta-regression were conducted on a commercial farm. The strength of evidence of the effect of these additives was very low. Studies conducted under commercial conditions are needed to understand the potential benefit of these interventions for the poultry industry and to improve the strength of evidence of the effectiveness of these additives.},

	abstract = {East and Southeast Asia are important pig- and poultry-producing areas, where the majority of production takes place on small-scale farms with low biosecurity levels. This systematic review synthesizes data on swine influenza virology, serology and epidemiology in East and Southeast Asia. A total of 77 research articles, literature reviews and conference papers were selected and analyzed from 510 references retrieved from PubMed and ISI Web of KnowledgeSM. The number of published articles increased in the last 3 years, which may be attributed to improvement in monitoring and/or a better promotion of surveillance data. Nevertheless, large inequalities in surveillance and research among countries are underlined. Virological results represent the largest part of published data, while the serological and epidemiological features of swine influenza in East and Southeast Asia remain poorly described. The literature shows that there have been several emergences of swine influenza in the region, and also considerable evidence of multiple introductions of North American and avian-like European strains. Furthermore, several avian-origin strains are isolated from pigs, including H5 and H9 subtypes. However, their low seroprevalence in swine also shows that pigs remain poorly infected by these subtypes. We conclude that sero-epidemioligical investigations have been neglected, and that they may help to improve virological surveillance. Inter- and intra-continental surveillance of gene flows will benefit the region. Greater investment is needed in swine influenza surveillance, to improve our knowledge of circulating strains as well as the epidemiology and disease burden in the region.},

	abstract = {Vaccination to reduce the occurrence of bovine respiratory disease is a commonly performed preventive health measure employed by veterinarians and beef cattle producers. Despite its widespread acceptance, evidence relating health and performance outcomes of receiving and feedlot cattle to vaccination for viral components of the bovine respiratory disease complex remains to be completely established. PubMed, CAB Abstracts, and The Bovine Practitioner were searched for peer-reviewed journal articles reporting field trials of viral respiratory vaccines utilizing naturally occurring disease models published in English between 1982 and 2012. Antigens of interest for this systematic review included bovine herpesvirus-1, parainfluenzavirus type 3, bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, and bovine coronavirus. Search results were also reviewed for manuscripts reporting the effects of timing on viral respiratory vaccine efficacy in receiving and feedlot cattle. Studies were included in this review only if they reported clinically relevant outcomes, which were defined as morbidity, mortality, rates of chronic illness, lung lesions identified at necropsy or harvest, and performance parameters including average daily gain and feed-to-gain ratios.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the literature on the efficacy of equine assisted activities and therapies (EAAT) on gross motor outcomes representing the ICF component of body functions and activity in children with cerebral palsy (CP). METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational studies of hippotherapy (HPOT) and therapeutic horseback riding (TR) for children with spastic CP. Gross motor outcomes, assessed via muscle activity and muscle tone, gait, posture and Gross Motor Function Measures (GMFM) were evaluated. RESULTS: Five TR studies and nine HPOT studies were included. Our meta-analysis indicated that short-term HPOT (total riding time 8-10 min) significantly reduced asymmetrical activity of the hip adductor muscles. HPOT could improve postural control in children with spastic CP, GMFCS level {\textless} 5. However, the evidence did not show a statistically significant effect on GMFM after long-term HPOT or TR (total riding time, 8-22 h) in children with spastic CP. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review found insufficient evidence to support the claim that long-term TR or HPOT provide a significant benefit to children with spastic CP. We found no statistically significant evidence of either therapeutic effect or maintenance effects on the gross motor activity status in CP children.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Wild birds and especially migratory species can become long-distance vectors for a wide range of microorganisms. The objective of the current paper is to summarize available literature on pathogens causing human disease that have been associated with wild bird species. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed to identify specific pathogens known to be associated with wild and migratory birds. The evidence for direct transmission of an avian borne pathogen to a human was assessed. Transmission to humans was classified as direct if there is published evidence for such transmission from the avian species to a person or indirect if the transmission requires a vector other than the avian species. RESULTS: Several wild and migratory birds serve as reservoirs and/or mechanical vectors (simply carrying a pathogen or dispersing infected arthropod vectors) for numerous infectious agents. An association with transmission from birds to humans was identified for 10 pathogens. Wild birds including migratory species may play a significant role in the epidemiology of influenza A virus, arboviruses such as West Nile virus and enteric bacterial pathogens. Nevertheless only one case of direct transmission from wild birds to humans was found. CONCLUSION: The available evidence suggests wild birds play a limited role in human infectious diseases. Direct transmission of an infectious agent from wild birds to humans is rarely identified. Potential factors and mechanisms involved in the transmission of infectious agents from birds to humans need further elucidation.},

A scoping study (ScS) was conducted to characterize published research investigating selected zoonotic bacteria and public health topics in various wild and farmed aquatic species and seafood. This was followed by a systematic review (SR) on selected bacteria (Aeromonas spp., generic Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., and Vibrio spp.) and aquatic species (clams, mussels, oysters, salmon, and shrimp [including prawn]); a meta-analysis (MA) was conducted only at the retail level due to considerable variability among various pathogen/seafood combinations. The ScS revealed the most frequently investigated themes were farm-level prevalence and intervention research for Vibrio spp. and Aeromonas spp. Antimicrobial use (AMU) and the association between AMU and antimicrobial resistance were rarely investigated. The SR indicated a consistent lack of reporting regarding study methodology and results, precluding the use of many studies in and full benefits of MA. MA of Aeromonas, E. coli, and Salmonella prevalence in retail salmon resulted in pooled estimates of 13\% (6-27\%), 2\% (0.1-11\%), and 1\% (0-5\%), respectively. When MA of pathogen/seafood combination resulted in statistically significant heterogeneity (p{\textless}0.1), median/range were reported at the region level. The results from our ScS, SR, and MA could be used for better design of future bacteriological surveys of seafood and as inputs for risk assessments or surveillance initiatives in this field.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a contagious, fatal prion disease affecting cervids in a growing number of regions across North America. Projected deer population declines and concern about potential spread of CWD to other species warrant strategies to manage this disease. Control efforts to date have been largely unsuccessful, resulting in continuing spread and increasing prevalence. This systematic review summarizes peer-reviewed published reports describing field-applicable CWD control strategies in wild deer populations in North America using systematic review methods. Ten databases were searched for peer-reviewed literature. Following deduplication, relevance screening, full-text appraisal, subject matter expert review and qualitative data extraction, nine references were included describing four distinct management strategies. RESULTS: Six of the nine studies used predictive modeling to evaluate control strategies. All six demonstrated one or more interventions to be effective but results were dependant on parameters and assumptions used in the model. Three found preferential removal of CWD infected deer to be effective in reducing CWD prevalence; one model evaluated a test and slaughter strategy, the other selective removal of infected deer by predators and the third evaluated increased harvest of the sex with highest prevalence (males). Three models evaluated non-selective harvest of deer. There were only three reports that examined primary data collected as part of observational studies. Two of these studies supported the effectiveness of intensive non-selective culling; the third study did not find a difference between areas that were subjected to culling and those that were not. Seven of the nine studies were conducted in the United States. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the paucity of evaluated, field-applicable control strategies for CWD in wild deer populations. Knowledge gaps in the complex epidemiology of CWD and the intricacies inherent to prion diseases currently pose significant challenges to effective control of this disease in wild deer in North America.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The threat posed by highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 viruses to humans remains significant, given the continued occurrence of sporadic human cases (499 human cases in 15 countries) with a high case fatality rate (approximately 60\%), the endemicity in poultry populations in several countries, and the potential for reassortment with the newly emerging 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain. Therefore, we review risk factors for H5N1 infection in humans. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Several epidemiologic studies have evaluated the risk factors associated with increased risk of H5N1 infection among humans who were exposed to H5N1 viruses. Our review shows that most H5N1 cases are attributed to exposure to sick poultry. Most cases are sporadic, while occasional limited human-to-human transmission occurs. The most commonly identified factors associated with H5N1 virus infection included exposure through contact with infected blood or bodily fluids of infected poultry via food preparation practices; touching and caring for infected poultry; consuming uncooked poultry products; exposure to H5N1 via swimming or bathing in potentially virus laden ponds; and exposure to H5N1 at live bird markets. CONCLUSIONS: Research has demonstrated that despite frequent and widespread contact with poultry, transmission of the H5N1 virus from poultry to humans is rare. Available research has identified several risk factors that may be associated with infection including close direct contact with poultry and transmission via the environment. However, several important data gaps remain that limit our understanding of the epidemiology of H5N1 in humans. Although infection in humans with H5N1 remains rare, human cases continue to be reported and H5N1 is now considered endemic among poultry in parts of Asia and in Egypt, providing opportunities for additional human infections and for the acquisition of virus mutations that may lead to more efficient spread among humans and other mammalian species. Collaboration between human and animal health sectors for surveillance, case investigation, virus sharing, and risk assessment is essential to monitor for potential changes in circulating H5N1 viruses and in the epidemiology of H5N1 in order to provide the best possible chance for effective mitigation of the impact of H5N1 in both poultry and humans.

	abstract = {A dry period of 6-8weeks for dairy cows is generally thought to maximise milk production in the next lactation. However, the value of such a long dry period is increasingly questioned. In particular, shortening the dry period shifts milk production from the critical period after calving to the weeks before calving. This shift in milk production could improve the energy balance (EB), health and fertility of dairy cows. The objective of this study was to systematically review the current knowledge on dry period length in relation to milk production, EB, fertility, and health of cows and calves. A meta-analysis was performed for variables where at least five studies were available. Overall, both shortening and omitting the dry period reduces milk production, increases milk protein percentage and tends to reduce the risk of ketosis in the next lactation. Individual studies reported an improvement of EB after a short or no dry period, compared with a conventional dry period. Shortening or omitting the dry period did not affect milk fat percentage and shortening the dry period did not alter the odds ratio for mastitis, metritis, or fertility measures in the next lactation. So, current evidence for an improvement of health and fertility of dairy cows is marginal and may be partly explained by the limited number of studies which have evaluated health and fertility in relation to dry period length, the limited number of animals in those studies and the variable responses reported.},

OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were: 1) to evaluate the risk of bias assessment in animal-based systematic reviews, and 2) to study the internal validity of the primary animal studies included in these systematic reviews. DATA SOURCES: We systematically searched Pubmed and Embase for SRs of preclinical animal studies published between 2005 and 2012. RESULTS: A total of 91 systematic reviews met our inclusion criteria. The risk of bias was assessed in 48 (52.7\%) of these 91 systematic reviews. Thirty-three (36.3\%) SRs provided sufficient information to evaluate the internal validity of the included studies. Of the evaluated primary studies, 24.6\% was randomized, 14.6\% reported blinding of the investigator/caretaker, 23.9\% blinded the outcome assessment, and 23.1\% reported drop-outs. CONCLUSIONS: To improve the translation of animal data to clinical practice, systematic reviews of animal studies are worthwhile, but the internal validity of primary animal studies needs to be improved. Furthermore, risk of bias should be assessed by systematic reviews of animal studies to provide insight into the reliability of the available evidence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Q fever is a common cause of febrile illness and community-acquired pneumonia in resource-limited settings. Coxiella burnetii, the causative pathogen, is transmitted among varied host species, but the epidemiology of the organism in Africa is poorly understood. We conducted a systematic review of C. burnetii epidemiology in Africa from a "One Health" perspective to synthesize the published data and identify knowledge gaps. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We searched nine databases to identify articles relevant to four key aspects of C. burnetii epidemiology in human and animal populations in Africa: infection prevalence; disease incidence; transmission risk factors; and infection control efforts. We identified 929 unique articles, 100 of which remained after full-text review. Of these, 41 articles describing 51 studies qualified for data extraction. Animal seroprevalence studies revealed infection by C. burnetii ({\textless}/=13\%) among cattle except for studies in Western and Middle Africa (18-55\%). Small ruminant seroprevalence ranged from 11-33\%. Human seroprevalence was {\textless}8\% with the exception of studies among children and in Egypt (10-32\%). Close contact with camels and rural residence were associated with increased seropositivity among humans. C. burnetii infection has been associated with livestock abortion. In human cohort studies, Q fever accounted for 2-9\% of febrile illness hospitalizations and 1-3\% of infective endocarditis cases. We found no studies of disease incidence estimates or disease control efforts. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: C. burnetii infection is detected in humans and in a wide range of animal species across Africa, but seroprevalence varies widely by species and location. Risk factors underlying this variability are poorly understood as is the role of C. burnetii in livestock abortion. Q fever consistently accounts for a notable proportion of undifferentiated human febrile illness and infective endocarditis in cohort studies, but incidence estimates are lacking. C. burnetii presents a real yet underappreciated threat to human and animal health throughout Africa.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Various treatments of osteoarthritis (OA) have been described, including use of nutraceuticals. OBJECTIVES: To review systematically the literature about the effects of nutraceuticals on clinical signs of pain or abnormal locomotion in horses, dogs, and cats, and to discuss methodological aspects of trials and systematic reviews. METHODS: A systematic search of controlled trials evaluating the impact of nutraceuticals on OA in horses, dogs, and cats was performed, using Medline, CAB Abstracts, and Google Scholar. Scientific evidence was evaluated by means of criteria proposed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and a scoring system adapted from both the CONsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement and recommendations for assessing trials by the Center of Evidence Based Medicine of Oxford. RESULTS: Twenty-two papers were selected and reviewed, with 5 studies performed in horses, 16 in dogs, and 1 in cats. The strength of evidence was low for all nutraceuticals except for omega-3 fatty acid in dogs. There were limited numbers of rigorous randomized controlled trials and of participants in clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The evidence of efficacy of nutraceuticals is poor, with the exception of diets supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids in dogs. Greater access to systematic reviews must be part of the objectives of the veterinary science in the future. Their reporting would be improved by internationally agreed-upon criteria for standards and guidelines.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the existing information on the efficacy of commercial vaccination to reduce the prevalence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in weaned cattle in beef feedlot finishing systems under commercial conditions. Currently, only two commercial vaccines exist, and thus, only publications reporting the use of vaccines targeting type III secreted proteins and/or siderophore receptor and porin proteins (SRP) were considered relevant. A total of 18 studies reporting 45 comparisons were included in this review. Meta-analyses were conducted variously on (i) pre-harvest outcomes, (ii) at-harvest outcomes and (iii) both pre-harvest and at-harvest outcomes combined. Overall, efficacy of vaccination was consistently observed. Efficacy and homogeneity of the results was demonstrated for the two-dose regimen, allowing us to conclude with confidence that the two-dose approach is efficacious. For pre-harvest outcomes and two-dose regimens, the odds ratios (OR) were 0.53 (95\% CI = 0.45-0.62) for the two vaccines combined and 0.49 (95\% CI = 0.40-0.60) for vaccine targeting type III secreted proteins. The test for heterogeneity among studies yielded a Q test P = 0.354 for the two vaccines combined and Q test P = 0.269 for the vaccine targeting type III secreted proteins, indicating homogeneity in both cases. For pre- and at-harvest outcomes combined and two-dose regimens, the odds ratios (OR) were 0.52 (95\% CI = 0.44-0.61) for the two vaccines combined and 0.45 (95\% CI = 0.34-0.60) for vaccine targeting type III secreted proteins. The test for heterogeneity among studies yielded a Q test P = 0.134 for the two vaccines combined indicating homogeneity and Q test P = 0.089 for the vaccine targeting type III secreted proteins indicating heterogeneity. Based on this meta-analysis, bovine vaccination appears to be an effective approach to the pre-harvest control of E. coli O157:H7.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews both the beneficial and adverse effects of permissive hypercapnic respiratory acidosis in critically ill newborn foals. It has been shown that partial carbon dioxide pressure (PCO2) above the traditional safe range (hypercapnia), has beneficial effects on the physiology of the respiratory, cardiovascular, and nervous system in neonates. In human neonatal critical care medicine permissive hypercapnic acidosis is generally well-tolerated by patients and is more beneficial to their wellbeing than normal carbon dioxide (CO2) pressure or normocapnia. Even though adverse effects of hypercapnia have been reported, especially in patients with central nervous system pathology and/or chronic infection, critical care clinicians often artificially increase PCO2 to take advantage of its positive effects on compromised neonate tissues. This is referred to as therapeutic hypercapnia. Hypercapnic respiratory acidosis is common in critically ill newborn foals and has traditionally been considered as not beneficial. A search of online scientific databases was conducted to survey the literature on the effects of hypercapnia in neonates, with emphasis on newborn foals. The dynamic status of safety levels of PCO2 and data on the effectiveness of different carbon dioxide levels are not available for newborn foals and should be scientifically determined. Presently, permissive hypercapnia should be implemented or tolerated cautiously in compromised newborn foals and its use should be based on relevant data from adult horses and other species.},

	abstract = {Predictive models of parasite life cycles increase our understanding of how parasite epidemiology is influenced by global changes and can be used to support decisions for more targeted worm control. Estimates of parasite population dynamics are needed to parameterize such models. The aim of this study was to quantify the main life history traits of Ostertagia ostertagi, economically the most important nematode of cattle in temperate regions. The main parameters determining parasite density during the parasitic phase of O. ostertagi are (i) the larval establishment rate, (ii) hypobiosis rate, (iii) adult mortality and (iv) female fecundity (number of eggs laid per day per female). A systematic review was performed covering studies from 1962 to 2007, in which helminth-naive calves were artificially infected with O. ostertagi. The database was further extended with results of unpublished trials conducted at the Laboratory for Parasitology of Ghent University, Belgium. Overall inverse variance weighted estimates were computed for each of the traits through random effects models. An average establishment rate (+/-S.E.) of 0.269+/-0.022 was calculated based on data of 27 studies (46 experiments). The establishment rate declined when infection dose increased and was lower in younger animals. An average proportion of larvae entering hypobiosis (+/-S.E.) of 0.041 (+/-0.009) was calculated based on 27 studies (54 experiments). The proportion of ingested larvae that went into hypobiosis was higher in animals that received concomitant infections with nematode species other than O. ostertagi (mixed infections). An average daily adult mortality (+/-S.E.) of 0.028 (+/-0.002) was computed based on data from 28 studies (70 experiments). Adult mortality was positively correlated with infection dose. A daily fecundity (+/-S.E.) of 284 (+/-45) eggs per female was found based on nine studies (10 experiments). The average female sex ratio of O. ostertagi based on individual animal data (n=75) from six different studies was estimated to be 0.55. We believe that this systematic review is the first to summarise the available data on the main life history traits of the parasitic phase of O. ostertagi. In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides novel estimates for the parameterization of life cycle-based transmission models, explicitly reports measures of variance around these estimates, gives evidence for density dependence of larval establishment and adult mortality, shows that host age affects larval establishment and, to our knowledge, provides the first evidence for O. ostertagi of a female-biased sex ratio.},

	abstract = {Leptospirosis is a bacterial systemic infection which affects domestic animals and wildlife, as well as humans. Many wild animals act as reservoirs of leptospires. Nevertheless, the real role of wildlife animals as source of infection to livestock and humans, as well as the most important reservoirs and leptospiral strains remains unclear. This systematic review assesses the available data about wildlife and their biomes in Latin America, concerning to leptospiral infection. In addition, we discuss the development of the research on leptospirosis in wildlife in this region. After the application of exclusion criteria, 79 papers were analyzed, comprising 186 species, 122 genus, 53 families, and 19 orders from four classes. Mammals were the most studied class, followed by Amphibian, Reptile, and Aves. The Icterohaemorrhagiae serogroup was predominant in most biomes and many orders. A small number of antigens detected the majority of seroreactive animals of each class, and a smaller panel may be used at microscopic agglutination test. Further studies must always consider edaphoclimatic conditions besides only host class or species, in order to obtain a broader understanding of the wild epidemiological cycle of leptospirosis in the region. In conclusion, direct and indirect evidences demonstrate that leptospirosis is largely widespread among wildlife in all biomes of Latin America. Moreover, more research on the role of wildlife on the epidemiology of leptospirosis and its impact on livestock and public health are required, particularly focusing on direct detection of the agent.},

In this paper we reviewed published models of the bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) spread within a herd. Modelling options and assumptions on herd dynamics and BVDV transmission were discussed. A cattle herd is a population with a controlled size. Animals are separated into subgroups according to their age or their physiological status inducing heterogeneity of horizontal transmission. Complexity of models results from: (1) horizontal and vertical virus transmission, (2) birth of persistently infected animals, (3) excretion by transiently and persistently infected animals. Areas where there was a lack of knowledge were identified. Assumptions on the force of infection used to model the horizontal virus transmission were presented and discussed. We proposed possible ways of improving models (e.g. force of infection, validation) and essential model features for further BVDV models.},

	abstract = {Nontyphoidal Salmonella are one of the leading causes of foodborne diseases in the world. As poultry products are recognized as main sources of human salmonellosis, nontyphoidal Salmonella control has become a global issue for the poultry industry. The increasing antimicrobial resistance in poultry-related nontyphoidal Salmonella serovars is a global matter of concern. By monitoring the evolution of antimicrobial resistance, alternative treatments can be identified and possible restrictions in the treatment of systemic human salmonellosis foreseen. A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the profile and temporal evolution of the antimicrobial resistance of nontyphoidal Salmonella of poultry and human origin in Brazil, isolated in the period from 1995 to 2014. Four databases were researched; twenty-nine articles met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. In the nontyphoidal isolates of poultry origin, the highest levels of antimicrobial resistance were verified for sulfonamides (44.3\%), nalidixic acid (42.5\%), and tetracycline (35.5\%). In the human-origin isolates, the resistance occurred mainly for sulfonamides (46.4\%), tetracycline (36.9\%), and ampicillin (23.6\%). Twenty-two articles described results of antimicrobial resistance specifically for Salmonella Enteritidis, also enabling the individual meta-analysis of this serovar. For most antimicrobials, the resistance levels of Salmonella Enteritidis were lower than those found when considering all the nontyphoidal serovars. In the poultry-origin isolates, a quadratic temporal distribution was observed, with reduced resistance to streptomycin in Salmonella Enteritidis and in all nontyphoidal serovars, and a linear increase of resistance to nalidixic acid in Salmonella Enteritidis. In the human-origin isolates, a linear increase was identified in the resistance to nalidixic acid in Salmonella Enteritidis and in all the nontyphoidal isolates, and to gentamicin in Salmonella Enteritidis. Continuous monitoring of the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance could support the measurement of the consequences on poultry and human health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The zoonotic potential of Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) has been debated for almost a century because of similarities between Johne's Disease (JD) in cattle and Crohn's disease (CD) in humans. Our objective was to evaluate scientific literature investigating the potential association between these two diseases (MAP and CD) and the presence of MAP in retail milk or dairy products using a qualitative systematic review. METHOD: The search strategy included 19 bibliographic databases, 8 conference proceedings, reference lists of 15 articles and contacting 28 topic-related scientists. Two independent reviewers performed relevance screening, quality assessment and data extraction stages of the review. RESULTS: Seventy-five articles were included. Among 60 case-control studies that investigated the association between MAP and CD, 37 were of acceptable quality. Twenty-three studies reported significant positive associations, 23 reported non-significant associations, and 14 did not detect MAP in any sample. Different laboratory tests, test protocols, types of samples and source populations were used in these studies resulting in large variability among studies. Seven studies investigated the association between CD and JD, two challenge trials reported contradictory results, one cross-sectional study did not support the association, and four descriptive studies suggested that isolated MAP is often closely related to cattle isolates. MAP detection in raw and pasteurized milk was reported in several studies. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for the zoonotic potential of MAP is not strong, but should not be ignored. Interdisciplinary collaboration among medical, veterinary and other public health officials may contribute to a better understanding of the potential routes of human exposure to MAP.},

	abstract = {This systematic review-meta-analysis appraises and summarizes all the available research (128 papers) on the zoonotic potential of Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis. The latter has been debated for a century due to pathogenic and clinical similarities between Johne's disease in ruminants and Crohn's disease (108 studies) in humans and recently for involvement in other human diseases; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (2), sarcoidosis (3), diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM) (7) and type 2 (3), multiple sclerosis (5) and Hashimoto's thyroiditis (2). Meta-analytical results indicated a significant positive association, consistently across different laboratory methods for Crohn's disease [odds ratio (OR) range 4.26-8.44], T1DM (OR range 2.91-9.95) and multiple sclerosis (OR range 6.5-7.99). The latter two and the thyroiditis hypothesis require further investigation to confirm the association. Meta-regression of Crohn's disease studies using DNA detection methods indicated that choice of primers and sampling frame (e.g. general population vs. hospital-based sample) explained a significant proportion of heterogeneity. Other epidemiological studies demonstrated a lack of association between high-risk occupations and development of Crohn's disease. Due to knowledge gaps in understanding the role of M. paratuberculosis in the development or progression of human disease, the evidence at present is not strong enough to inform the potential public health impact of M. paratuberculosis exposure.},

	abstract = {As endemic goitre was widespread in New Zealand before the introduction of iodized salt, it was assumed that ruminants, particularly dairy cows, may benefit from iodine supplementation although clinical signs of I deficiency are rare. Several trials with sheep have not indicated any significant response in productivity to I supplements, but no definitive trials have been made with dairy cows. Estimates of pasture I concentrations are variable and requirements for lactating cows are imprecise. To ascertain the possibility of a response to I supplements, 2 literature searches, with CAB ABSTRACTS and DIALOG, were made and the procedures involved in each search are described. There were only 3 data sets in which the effect of I supplementation was studied in cows with an inadequate I intake. There was no response in terms of milk production or composition. It is suggested that, in the absence of goitrogens, pasture I less than 500 mu g/kg DM may be adequate for lactating cows but there are insufficient data on pasture or milk I in New Zealand to make an informed judgment on I status in dairy cows.},

	abstract = {Use of glyphosate-based herbicides is increasing worldwide. The authors review the available data related to potential impacts of these herbicides on amphibians and conduct a qualitative meta-analysis. Because little is known about environmental concentrations of glyphosate in amphibian habitats and virtually nothing is known about environmental concentrations of the substances added to the herbicide formulations that mainly contribute to adverse effects, glyphosate levels can only be seen as approximations for contamination with glyphosate-based herbicides. The impact on amphibians depends on the herbicide formulation, with different sensitivity of taxa and life stages. Effects on development of larvae apparently are the most sensitive endpoints to study. As with other contaminants, costressors mainly increase adverse effects. If and how glyphosate-based herbicides and other pesticides contribute to amphibian decline is not answerable yet due to missing data on how natural populations are affected. Amphibian risk assessment can only be conducted case-specifically, with consideration of the particular herbicide formulation. The authors recommend better monitoring of both amphibian populations and contamination of habitats with glyphosate-based herbicides, not just glyphosate, and suggest including amphibians in standardized test batteries to study at least dermal administration.},

The objective of this meta-analysis is to provide evidence for decision-making and further research on AI prevention through identifying the risk factors associated with AI infection on poultry farms. METHODS: The results from 15 selected studies on risk factors for AI infections on poultry farms were analyzed quantitatively by meta-analysis. RESULTS: Open water source (OR=2.89), infections on nearby farms (OR=4.54), other livestock (OR=1.90) and disinfection of farm (OR=0.54) have significant association with AI infection on poultry farms. The subgroup analysis results indicate that there exist different risk factors for AI infections in different types of farms. CONCLUSIONS: The main risk factors for AI infection in poultry farms are environmental conditions (open water source, infections on nearby farms), keeping other livestock on the same farm and no disinfection of the farm.},

This study was a systematic review of published literature. A search was conducted to identify all manuscripts relating to antibiotic treatment of cattle with respiratory disease. Relevant studies reported treatment with tulathromycin of naturally occurring respiratory disease in beef cattle in North America. Studies which failed to use randomization to minimize bias were excluded from the review. The relative risk of retreatment for bovine respiratory disease was calculated for each study included in the final review. Initially, 782 potential manuscripts were identified. After relevance screening and quality assessment, 21 high quality manuscripts were available for analysis. Two peer reviewed publications and two technical reports describing 14 trials compared tulathramycin with tilmicosin or florfenicol. In the meta-analysis of studies comparing tilmicosin with tulathromycin, the summary Mantel-Haenszel relative risk was 0.51 (95\% confidence interval 0.45-0.57). It was not possible to calculate a summary Mantel-Haenszel relative risk comparing florfenicol with tulathromycin as the only three studies reported this comparison. When using a meta-analysis to combined data from randomized clinical trials reporting treatment with tulathromycin or either florfenicol or tilmicosin, tulathromycin was associated with an approximately 50\% reduction in the risk of re-treatment for bovine respiratory disease compared with treatment with tilmicosin.},

We used meta-analysis to examine the relationship between dietary crude protein and conception rate.

MILK UREA CONCENTRATIONS AND DAIRY COW FERTILITY: The use of milk urea as an indicator of dietary energy and protein intake and as an indicator of reproductive performance has been questioned. We found that changes in urea concentration in body fluids explained only 25\% (p = 0.08) of the variance in conception rate after conducting a meta-analysis of available studies. INTERPRETATION OF MILK UREA CONCENTRATIONS: High intakes of dietary protein may induce adaptations in urea metabolism, and the negative relationship identified between high intakes of dietary protein and fertility for Northern Hemisphere dairy herds may not necessarily apply in Australasian dairy herds. Because of the potential for cows to adapt to high protein diets, the use of a single milk urea determination on a herd will have limited value as an indicator of nutritional status and little value as a predictor of fertility.},

	abstract = {The objectives of this study were to evaluate heat stress feed intake models for growing swine using a data set assembled from the literature and to develop a series of new equations modeling the influence of the thermal environment and interactions between the thermal environmental and other factors on feed intake. A literature survey was conducted to identify studies assessing intake responses to temperature. The resulting data set comprised 35 studies containing 120 comparisons to thermoneutral intake. Intake as a fraction of thermoneutral intake (FFI) was the primary response variable, where a value of 1 represented no change from thermoneutral intake. The FFI predicted by NRC and a recent model from a meta-analysis (Renaudeau et al.,) were compared to observed values. New parameters for the NRC equation (NRCmod) were derived, and a series of new equations incorporating duration of exposure (TD), temperature cycling (TC), and floor type (TH) were also derived. Root-mean-square prediction error (RMSPE) and concordance correlation coefficients were used to evaluate all models. The RMSPE for the NRC model was 23.6 with mean and slope bias accounting for 12.6\% and 51.1\% of prediction error, respectively. The TD, TC, and TH models had reduced RMSPE compared with NRC: 12.9 for TD, 12.6 for TC, and 12.9 for TS. Substantial improvements were also made by refitting parameters (NRCmod; RMSPE 13.0\%). In NRCmod, TD, TC, and TH, random error was the predominant source, accounting for over 97\% of prediction error. The Renaudeau et al. model was also evaluated. Renaudeau et al. had relatively low RMSPE (22.3) for intake but higher RMSPE for FFI (22.6) than NRC, NRCmod, TD, TC, or TH. Additional parameters were derived for the Renaudeau et al. equation to account for housing system and diet characteristics. This adjustment reduced RMSPE of predicting feed intake (16.0) and FFI (16.3) and reduced systematic bias in the equation. This evaluation of equations highlights the effects of novel explanatory variables on feed intake during heat stress, and the comparison can be useful when selecting a model that best explains variability in feed intake responses to heat stress given available input data.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To systematically review clinical and preclinical data on hydroxyethyl starch (HES) tissue storage. METHODS: MEDLINE (PubMed) was searched and abstracts were screened using defined criteria to identify articles containing original data on HES tissue accumulation. RESULTS: Forty-eight studies were included: 37 human studies with a total of 635 patients and 11 animal studies. The most frequent indication for fluid infusion was surgery accounting for 282 patients (45.9\%). HES localization in skin was shown by 17 studies, in kidney by 12, in liver by 8, and in bone marrow by 5. Additional sites of HES deposition were lymph nodes, spleen, lung, pancreas, intestine, muscle, trophoblast, and placental stroma. Among major organs the highest measured tissue concentration of HES was in the kidney. HES uptake into intracellular vacuoles was observed by 30 min after infusion. Storage was cumulative, increasing in proportion to dose, although in 15\% of patients storage and associated symptoms were demonstrated at the lowest cumulative doses (0.4 g kg(-1)). Some HES deposits were extremely long-lasting, persisting for 8 years or more in skin and 10 years in kidney. Pruritus associated with HES storage was described in 17 studies and renal dysfunction in ten studies. In one included randomized trial, HES infusion produced osmotic nephrosis-like lesions indicative of HES storage (p = 0.01) and also increased the need for renal replacement therapy (odds ratio, 9.50; 95\% confidence interval, 1.09-82.7; p = 0.02). The tissue distribution of HES was generally similar in animals and humans. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue storage of HES is widespread, rapid, cumulative, frequently long-lasting, and potentially harmful.},

This review of data compares the performance effects (ADG, G:F, DMI) of technologies used in conventional feeding programs that are prohibited in organic programs, natural programs, or both. The technologies evaluated were steroid implants, monensin, tylosin, endectocides, and metaphylaxis with any antimicrobial. For inclusion in this analysis, studies were conducted in North America, reported randomization to treatment group, used beef cattle, contained an untreated control group, and were sourced from peer-reviewed journals. Forest plots were used to examine the data visually for trends toward a uniform effect of the technology on the outcomes of interest (ADG, DMI, G:F). Technologies that displayed a uniform response on the forest plot compared with negative controls were then analyzed using mixed models. Examination of forest plots for endectocides, steroid implants, monensin, and metaphylaxis technologies appeared to show performance advantages for treated cattle relative to cattle in negative control groups. An insufficient number of studies met the inclusion criteria to conduct meta-analyses comparing endectocides, monensin, or tylosin with negative controls. Average daily gain in feeder cattle given metaphylaxis on arrival was 0.11 kg/d (P {\textless} 0.01) greater relative to cattle that did not receive metaphylaxis on arrival. Implanting heifers increased ADG by 0.08 kg/d compared with nonimplanted controls (P = 0.09). Implants had no effect on G:F (P = 0.14) in heifers or on DMI (P = 0.44) relative to nonimplanted control heifers. Implanting steers was associated with greater ADG, by 0.25 kg/d (P {\textless} 0.01), and DMI, by 0.53 kg/d (P {\textless} 0.01), relative to nonimplanted control steers. Implants also improved G:F in steers relative to nonimplanted steers, by 0.02 (0.17 vs. 0.15; implanted vs. controls, P {\textless} 0.01; n = 21 studies). When average estimated differences in ADG and G:F for implanted and nonimplanted steers were incorporated into a breakeven model, implanted steers had a \$77/animal lower cost of production than nonimplanted steers and a \$349/animal lower cost of production than organically raised steers. These data illustrate the importance of capturing premiums when operating natural and organic production systems to maintain economic viability.},

Our objective was to identify, assess, and summarize or synthesize the published research investigating the effect of HACCP programs on microbial prevalence and concentration on food animal carcasses in abattoirs through primary processing. The results of microbial testing pre- and post-HACCP implementation were reported in only 19 studies, mostly investigating beef (n=13 studies) and pork (n=8 studies) carcasses. In 12 of 13 studies measuring aerobic bacterial counts, reductions were reported on beef (7/8 studies), pork (3/3), poultry (1/1), and sheep (1/1). Significant (p{\textless}0.05) reductions in prevalence of Salmonella spp. were reported in studies on pork (2/3 studies) and poultry carcasses (3/3); no significant reductions were reported on beef carcasses (0/8 studies). These trends were confirmed through meta-analysis of these data; however, powerful meta-analysis was precluded because of an overall scarcity of individual studies and significant heterogeneity across studies. Australia reported extensive national data spanning the period from 4 years prior to HACCP implementation to 4 years post-HACCP, indicating reduction in microbial prevalence and concentration on beef carcasses in abattoirs slaughtering beef for export; however, the effect of abattoir changes initiated independent of HACCP could not be excluded. More primary research and access to relevant proprietary data are needed to properly evaluate HACCP program effectiveness using modeling techniques capable of differentiating the effects of HACCP from other concurrent factors.},

	abstract = {Five on-farm practices for reduction of Salmonella shedding or sero-prevalence in grow-finish swine were selected through scoping study and expert consultation. Specific examples were selected based on supporting evidence from at least one controlled trial (CT), and availability to Canadian swine producers. Efficacy was evaluated using systematic review and meta-analysis (SR-MA) methodology. A modified Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was applied to assess the quality of evidence for each intervention, and a 'summary of findings' table was developed to present findings 'at-a-glance'. MA of the small dataset of CTs investigating feeding meal, and measuring serology, yielded a significant summary estimate of efficacy (odds ratio (OR)=0.21; 95\% confidence intervals (CI): 0.14, 0.31) with non-significant heterogeneity (P{\textgreater}0.10). MA of the dataset investigating inclusion of organic acids in the ration, measuring serology, yielded a significant summary estimate with significant heterogeneity across studies (P{\textless}0.001, I(2)=91\%) precluding presentation of a single summary estimate; a range of results were reported (OR Range: 28 (1.6, 498); 0.07 (CI: 0.042, 0.33)). Pen disinfection between batches of finishers was studied in one large CT measuring both fecal culture (OR 0.84 (0.68, 1.1)) and serology (OR 0.48 (0.40, 0.58)) outcomes. The dataset investigating Salmonella spp. vaccination contained inconsistent findings (OR Range: 4.5 (1.3, 15); 0.07 (0.008, 0.68)), with significant heterogeneity across studies (P=0.005, I(2)=82), assessed measuring fecal culture. MA of the dataset investigating inclusion of in-feed tetracyclines yielded a significant OR indicating a potential harmful effect, measuring fecal culture, (OR Range: 14 (1.9, 108); 1.0 (0.43, 2.5)) with significant heterogeneity (P=0.003, I(2)=82\%) across studies, suggesting some potential for withdrawal of in-feed tetracyclines to reduce Salmonella shedding. Therefore our ranking of intervention efficacy is: feeding meal{\textgreater}inclusion of acids in ration, feeder pen disinfection or Salmonella spp. vaccination{\textgreater}in-feed tetrayclines. Study design characteristics increasing risk of bias, including failure to justify sample size (19 of 31 studies) and failure to report random or systematic sampling (13 of 31 studies), resulted in modified GRADE evidence rankings of 'low' for these interventions. This suggests that further research is likely to affect our findings. Field CTs investigating herd-level interventions with measurements at the herd- and individual-levels are recommended. Overall, SR-MA was a useful approach for ranking efficacy, and GRADE offered a transparent method for ranking quality of evidence, although both were limited by the small number of comparable studies available.},

Among 47 studies included in the review, 32 comparison studies were suitable for quality assessment. Fifteen studies were not assessed for quality, due to their descriptive nature or a low sample size (n {\textless}or= 2 farms). Overall, bacterial outcomes were reported in 17 studies, and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and multidrug resistance (MDR) of zoonotic or potentially zoonotic bacteria in 12 and 7 studies, respectively. Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli including Shiga toxin-producing strains, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and SCC were investigated in 2, 7, 4, 6, and 15 studies, respectively. Contradictory findings were reported for differences in bacterial outcomes and SCC between dairy production types (organic vs. conventional). Lower prevalence of AMR on organic dairy farms was reported more consistently in studies conducted in the United States, as opposed to those conducted in Europe. These conflicting findings may result from geographic differences in organic production regulations governing antimicrobial usage, use of antimicrobials in conventional dairy production, and baseline prevalence, as well as laboratory methods, study designs, or methods of analysis employed. The majority (four of seven) of MDR investigations reported no significant differences in prevalence. Overall, only 9 of 32 studies met all five methodological soundness criteria. More well designed, executed, and reported primary research is needed at the farm and post-farm levels.},

	abstract = {The accuracy of bacterial culture and PCR for Salmonella in swine was examined through systematic review of existing primary research in this field. A replicable search was conducted in 10 electronic databases. All steps of the review were conducted by two reviewers: to identify relevant publications, to assess their methodological soundness and reporting, and to extract raw data or reported test accuracy estimates. Meta-analyses and meta-regression were performed: to evaluate pooled estimates of test sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp), to identify variables explaining the variation in reported test estimates, and to evaluate the association between these variables and reported test Se and Sp. Twenty-nine studies were included in the review. Unique test evaluations reported in these 29 studies were categorized according to the type of test comparison: culture versus culture (n = 134 test evaluations) and PCR versus culture (n = 21). We identified significant heterogeneity among evaluations for each test category. For culture, more heterogeneity was caused by differences in individual test protocols (52\%) than overall differences between studies (16\%). Enrichment temperature, study population, agar and enrichment type were significantly associated with variation in culture Se. Furthermore, interaction between enrichment temperature and enrichment type was detected. For PCR, most of the heterogeneity was caused by overall differences between studies (65-70\%); sample type and study size were associated with variation in reported PCR Se and Sp. The overall methodological soundness and/or reporting of primary studies included in this review were poor, with variable use of reference standards, and consistent lack of the use or reporting of blinding, randomization and subject (sample) selection criteria. Consequently, the food safety and veterinary public health research community should formally consider ways for standardizing the conduct and reporting of this type of research.},

DATABASES USED: Four sources were used to identify manuscripts for review. Databases searched were those of the National Library of Medicine, EMBASE and CAB International. In addition, pertinent references in the bibliographies of included articles were retrieved. RESULTS: Twenty manuscripts published in refereed journals were reviewed. These included papers reporting 18 clinical trials and two studies conducted in conditioned research cats. Twelve analgesics were evaluated, including seven opioids, four non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and one local anesthetic. Nine studies involved a direct comparison of analgesic agents. Limb use was abnormal when measured at 2 and 12 days following onychectomy, and neither fentanyl patch nor butorphanol administration resulted in normal use of the surgical limb. In another study, cats evaluated at 6 months after this surgery were not lame. Differing surgical techniques were compared in six studies; the results indicated that pain scores were lower after laser surgery than after scalpel surgery. The difficulties associated with assessing pain in cats and the lack of sensitivity of the evaluation systems utilized were highlighted in many of the studies. Huge variations in dose and dosing strategies had significant impacts on drug efficacy. Statistically significant differences among treatments were found in most studies; however, no clearly superior analgesic treatment was identified. A combination of meloxicam or robenacoxib with an opioid may provide more effective analgesia and should be evaluated.},

Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria and whereas the findings are promising, they are inconclusive and limited because of the level of evidence, which included one Level I, six Level III, four Level IV and one Level V. All of the studies reviewed had research design quality concerns including small participant sizes, poor descriptions of the interventions, outcome measures with minimal psychometrics and lack of power calculations. Findings indicated three major themes including social/participation, functional and psychological outcomes; all of which are areas in the occupational therapy scope of practice. Occupational therapists may play a critical role in referral, assessment, assisting clients and consulting with training organizations before, during and after the service dog placement process. In order for health care professionals to have confidence in recommending this type of assistive technology, the evidence to support such decisions must be strengthened.},

	abstract = {Reducing zoonotic pathogens in food animals prior to harvest will reduce the pathogen burden that enters the food chain and the environment. Consequently, the burden of enteric illness in humans may be reduced. Evaluating interventions to reduce a pathogen in animals often begins with challenge trials, in which animals are deliberately exposed to the pathogen under controlled conditions. Challenge trials are subsequently followed by field trials, also known as randomized controlled trials, in which the animals are naturally exposed to the pathogen. Challenge trials can most effectively inform field trials only if they precede field trials, are robust, internally valid and transparently reported. Using systematic review and meta-analysis methodology, we examined the pre-harvest food safety literature for three intervention-pathogen-species combinations: probiotics/competitive exclusion products in ruminants to reduce Escherichia coli O157 shedding, vaccines in ruminants to reduce E. coli O157 shedding and vaccines in swine to reduce Salmonella shedding. We examined two outcomes, prevalence of faecal shedding at the end of the trial and prevalence of faecal shedding throughout the trial period, to compare challenge trials and field trials. We found that challenge trials occurred concurrently with field trials, challenge trials suffered from reporting deficiencies of methodological features, challenge trials tended to report a more favourable outcome than field trials, and there was some evidence of publication bias among all three intervention-pathogen-species combinations. Challenge trials would better serve to inform field trials if they precede field trials, are methodologically sound, include transparent reporting and are published regardless of their results. In addition, due to our findings of greater efficacy reported among challenge trials compared with field trials, risk models predicting the public health benefits of pre-harvest interventions to reduce zoonotic pathogens in livestock might be best served by field trial results alone.},

Infection occurs through direct contact with infected animals or their faeces, through contaminated food or water and/or through person-to-person transmission. A reduction in faecal E. coli O157 shedding in cattle might reduce the burden of human infections. We used systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of direct-fed microbials (DFM), compared with placebo or no treatment, fed during the pre-harvest stage of production in reducing faecal E. coli O157 shedding in beef cattle during field trials. Four electronic databases, Nebraska Beef Reports and review article reference lists were searched. A total of 16 publications assessing faecal shedding at the end of the trial and/or throughout the trial period were included. The majority of publicly disseminated trials evaluated the prevalence of E. coli O157 faecal shedding; only two evaluated the concentration of organisms in faeces. The prevalence of faecal E. coli O157 shedding in cattle is significantly reduced by DFM treatments (summary effect size for all DFM – OR = 0.46; CI = 0.36-0.60). The DFM combination Lactobacillus acidophilus (NP51) and Propionibacterium freudenreichii (NP24) was more efficacious in reducing the prevalence of faecal E. coli O157 shedding at the time of harvest and throughout the trial period compared with the group of other DFM, although this difference was not statistically significant. Furthermore, we found that the combination [NP51 and NP24] treatment was more efficacious in reducing the prevalence of faecal E. coli O157 shedding at the time of harvest and throughout the trial period when fed at the dose of 109 CFU/animal/day than any lesser amount, although this difference was not statistically significant. Feeding beef cattle DFM during the pre-harvest stage of production reduces the prevalence of E. coli O157 faecal shedding and might effectively reduce human infections.},

	abstract = {Although frequently examined as a target organ for non-endocrine toxicity, histopathological evaluation of the liver is becoming a routine component of endocrine disruption studies that utilize various fish species as test subjects. However, the interpretation of microscopic liver findings can be challenging, especially when attempting to distinguish adverse changes associated with endocrine disrupting substances from those caused by systemic or direct hepatic toxicity. The purpose of this project was to conduct a critical assessment of the available peer-reviewed and grey literature concerning the histopathologic effects of reproductive endocrine active substances (EAS) and non-endocrine acting substances in the livers of fish models, and to determine if liver histopathology can be used to reliably distinguish endocrine from non-endocrine etiologies. The results of this review suggest that few compound-specific histopathologic liver effects have been identified, among which are estrogen agonist-induced increases in hepatocyte basophilia and proteinaceous intravascular fluid in adult male teleosts, and potentially, decreased hepatocyte basophilia in female fish exposed to substances that possess androgenic, anti-estrogenic, or aromatase inhibitory activity. This review also used published standardized methodology to assess the credibility of the histopathology data in each of the 117 articles that reported liver effects of treatment, and consequently it was determined that in only 37\% of those papers were the data considered either highly credible or credible. The outcome of this work highlights the value of histopathologic liver evaluation as an investigative tool for EAS studies, and provides information that may have implications for EAS hazard assessment.},

	abstract = {Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is an important zoonotic disease; however, the efficacy of available vaccines for the prevention of naturally-occurring Leishmania infantum (L. infantum) infection in dogs remains unclear. The objective of this review was to determine the efficacy of currently available vaccines to prevent naturally-occurring L. infantum infection in dogs. Four bibliographic databases (CAB Direct 2011, Web of Science 2011, U.S. National Library of Medicine 2011 and Literatura Latino Americana e do Caribe em Ciencias da Saude) were searched along with eight sets of conference proceedings and the International Veterinary Information Service (IVIS) database, from 1980 to November 2012. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomised clinical trials (NRCTs), cohort studies and case-control studies that investigated vaccine efficacy for natural L. infantum infection in dogs were eligible for inclusion. Two review authors independently assessed each study against the inclusion criteria, independently extracted relevant data from all included studies and assessed the risk of methodological shortcomings in each individual study. The odds ratio (OR) and absolute risk reduction (ARR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference for continuous outcomes were calculated. Meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity of the studies identified. The search was conducted for all mitigations for CanL and yielded the title and abstract of 937 articles, from which 84 articles were screened based on full text. Twelve studies on vaccinations (five RCTs, seven NRCTs) were identified. Ten studies were at a high risk of methodological shortcomings, whilst two were at an unclear risk. The use of 200mug ALM protein, Leishmune(R), CaniLeish(R), LiESAp with MDP, and ALM with BCG tended to significantly reduce the proportion of dogs infected with L. infantum based on either parasitological or serological evidence. The use of lyophilized protein vaccine significantly increased the proportion of dogs infected with L. infantum based on either parasitological or serological evidence. There is peer-reviewed evidence that control measures are effective in preventing CanL with the results suggesting that between 6 and 54\% of infections could be prevented with vaccination. However, this evidence is based on a small number of RCTs, all of which are either at high or unclear risk of methodological shortcomings. Well-designed, adequately powered and properly reported randomised clinical trials are needed to clearly establish efficacy of vaccines as CanL control measures.},

The aim of this review was to critically evaluate previous research in order to identify publications which provide the best evidence of risk factors for naturally-occurring equine laminitis. A systematic review of English language publications was conducted using MEDLINE (1950-2010), CAB Direct (1910-2010) and IVIS (1997-2010). Additional publications were included by searching bibliographies. Search terms included laminitis, equine, risk factors and epidemiology. Publications which compared a case population to a control population and made inferences about parameters as risk factors for naturally-occurring equine laminitis were included. Information was extracted using predefined data fields, including 18 study quality indicators. In total, 17 publications were fully appraised. Six were considered to provide the most reliable information about risk factors for naturally-occurring laminitis. Information on signalment was well researched and there was good evidence for an association with chronic laminitis and increasing age. There remain inconsistent results for many other horse-level risk factors including gender, breed and bodyweight. Previous publications estimating risk factors for equine laminitis were of reasonable quality, although they were limited in the number and scope of the risk factors studied. High-quality, evidence-based studies are needed to identify further risk factors and to establish consensus over previously identified risk factors for different equine populations.},

Information was extracted using predefined data fields, including 13 study quality indicators. Sixty-nine publications were appraised. Ten were considered to provide the most reliable information, estimating the frequency of equine laminitis ranging from 1.5\% to 34\%. Previous publications estimating laminitis frequency were generally poor quality. Laminitis frequency varied across publications however the publications included in this review focussed on many of the different underlying laminitis aetiologies and comparison of the frequencies between groups would be inappropriate. High-quality evidence-based studies are needed to estimate the true disease frequency in different equine populations.},

	abstract = {Meat and meat products are the main vehicles of foodborne diseases in humans caused by pathogens such as Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) and Staphylococcus aureus. In order to prioritise research on those microbial hazards, a meta-analysis study was conducted to summarise available information on the presence of such pathogens in meats produced in Portugal. By using a logit-transformed proportion as effect size parameterisation, a number of multilevel random-effect meta-analysis models were fitted to estimate mean occurrence rates of pathogens, and to compare them among meat categories (i.e., bovine meat, broiler meat, pork, minced beef and minced pork), and among meat product categories (i.e., intended to be eaten cooked, to be eaten raw and cured meats). The mean occurrence rate of Campylobacter in Portuguese broiler meat (40\%; 95\% CI: 22.0-61.4\%) was about ten times higher than that of Salmonella (4.0\%; 95\% CI: 1.4-10.8\%); although these levels were comparable to current EU ranges. Nevertheless, in the other meat categories, the meta-analysed incidences of Salmonella were slightly to moderately higher than EU averages. A semi-quantitative risk ranking of pathogens in Portuguese-produced pork pointed Salmonella spp. as critical (with a mean occurrence of 12.6\%; 95\% CI: 8.0-19.3\%), and Y. enterocolitica as high (6.8\%; 95\% CI: 2.2-19.3\%). In the case of the Portuguese meat products, the non-compliance to EU microbiological criteria for L. monocytogenes (8.8\%; 95\% CI: 6.5-11.8\%) and Salmonella spp. (9.7\%; 95\% CI: 7.0-13.4\%) at sample units level, in the categories 'intended to be eaten cooked' and 'to be eaten raw', were considerably higher than EU levels for ready-to-eat products in comparable categories. S. aureus was the pathogen of greatest concern given its high occurrence (22.6\%; 95\% CI: 15.4-31.8\%) in meat products. These results emphasised the necessity of Portuguese food safety agencies to take monitoring, and training actions for the maintenance of good hygiene practices during the production of the great variety of traditional meat products. This meta-analysis study also highlighted important gaps of knowledge, and may assist food safety authorities in the prioritisation of microbiological hazards, and the implementation of essential food safety assurance systems at primary production.},

In this study, a meta-analysis using a univariate binary random effects model was carried out on 84 specific treatments reported in 53 publications involving control (n = 9905) and progesterone-treated (n = 9135) cows. Although the results of individual studies showed wide variations (-40\% to +50\% point changes), progesterone treatment resulted in an overall increase in pregnancy rate odds ratio (OR = 1.12; P {\textless} 0.01). Improvements in pregnancy rate were only observed in cows treated at natural estrus (OR = 1.41, P {\textless} 0.01) and not following synchronization of estrus or ovulation. Although treatment between Days 3 to 7 postinsemination was beneficial (OR = 1.15; P {\textless} 0.01), treatment earlier or later than this was not. Progesterone supplementation was beneficial in cows of lower fertility ({\textless}45\% control pregnancy rate) but not in cows with higher fertility. These results indicated that the benefit of progesterone supplementation on fertility of cows required exogenous progesterone supplementation to start between Day 3 to 7 and the appropriate reproductive status (i.e., lower fertility, natural estrus) of the treated cows.},

	abstract = {Knowledge synthesis refers to the integration of findings from individual research studies on a given topic or question into the global knowledge base. The application of knowledge synthesis methods, particularly systematic reviews and meta-analysis, has increased considerably in the agri-food public health sector over the past decade and this trend is expected to continue. The objectives of our review were: (1) to describe the most promising knowledge synthesis methods and their applicability in agri-food public health, and (2) to summarize the recent advancements, challenges, and opportunities in the use of systematic review and meta-analysis methods in this sector. We performed a structured review of knowledge synthesis literature from various disciplines to address the first objective, and used comprehensive insights and experiences in applying these methods in the agri-food public health sector to inform the second objective. We describe five knowledge synthesis methods that can be used to address various agri-food public health questions or topics under different conditions and contexts. Scoping reviews describe the main characteristics and knowledge gaps in a broad research field and can be used to evaluate opportunities for prioritizing focused questions for related systematic reviews. Structured rapid reviews are streamlined systematic reviews conducted within a short timeframe to inform urgent decision-making. Mixed-method and qualitative reviews synthesize diverse sources of contextual knowledge (e.g. socio-cognitive, economic, and feasibility considerations). Systematic reviews are a structured and transparent method used to summarize and synthesize literature on a clearly-defined question, and meta-analysis is the statistical combination of data from multiple individual studies. We briefly describe and discuss key advancements in the use of systematic reviews and meta-analysis, including: risk-of-bias assessments; an overall quality-of-evidence approach; engagement of stakeholders; Bayesian, multivariate, and network meta-analysis; and synthesis of diagnostic test accuracy studies. We also highlight several challenges and opportunities in the conduct of systematic reviews (e.g. inclusion of grey literature, minimizing language bias, and optimizing search strategies) and meta-analysis (e.g. inclusion of observational studies and approaches to address the insufficient reporting of data and significant heterogeneity). Many of these developments have yet to be comprehensively applied and evaluated in an agri-food public health context, and more research is needed in this area. There is a need to strengthen knowledge synthesis capacity and infrastructure at the regional, national, and international levels in this sector to ensure that the best available knowledge is used to inform future decision-making about agri-food public health issues.},

	abstract = {Pork is one of the major food sources of human salmonellosis worldwide, while beef products have been implicated in numerous foodborne outbreaks. As a result, effective interventions to reduce Salmonella contamination during beef and pork processing are of interest to both regulators and industry. We conducted a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of literature investigating the efficacy of slaughter and processing interventions to control Salmonella in beef and pork. Review steps included: a comprehensive search strategy; relevance screening of abstracts; relevance confirmation of articles; data extraction; risk-of-bias assessment; meta-analysis (where appropriate); and a weight-of-evidence assessment. A total of 191 relevant experimental studies were identified. Two controlled trials indicated that hot water and steam treatments are effective at reducing the prevalence of Salmonella on beef carcasses (relative risk [RR] = 0.11, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.02, 0.58), while four trials found that pre-chill organic acid washes are effective at reducing Salmonella on pork carcasses (RR = 0.32, 95\% CI: 0.13, 0.78), with high confidence in the estimates of effect. Four quasi-experimental studies found that post-exsanguination chemical washes were effective to reduce the prevalence of Salmonella on cattle hides, with low confidence in the specific estimate of effect; moderate confidence was found for the effect estimates of scalding (RR = 0.20, 95\% CI: 0.14, 0.29) and singeing (RR = 0.34, 95\% CI: 0.22, 0.52) of pork carcasses. The overall evidence supported enhanced reductions of Salmonella through a multiple-hurdle approach. In conclusion, various slaughter and processing interventions can contribute to reducing Salmonella on beef and pork carcasses, depending on the context of application; an appropriate combination should be selected, validated, and verified by establishment operators within their local conditions.},

	abstract = {Domestic animal husbandry, a common practice globally, can lead to zoonotic transmission of enteric pathogens. However, this risk has received little attention to date. This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the evidence for an association between domestic exposure to food-producing animals and cases of human diarrhea and specific enteric infections. We performed a systematic review of available literature to examine domestic livestock and poultry as risk factors for diarrhea and applied pre-determined quality criteria. Where possible, we carried out meta-analysis of specific animal-pathogen pairs. We found consistent evidence of a positive association between exposure to domestic food-producing animals and diarrheal illness across a range of animal exposures and enteric pathogens. Out of 29 studies included in the review, 20 (69.0\%) reported a positive association between domestic animal exposure and diarrhea. Domestic exposure to poultry revealed a substantial association with human campylobacteriosis (OR 2.73, 95\% CI 1.90-3.93). Our results suggest that domestic poultry and livestock exposures are associated with diarrheal illness in humans. Failure to ascertain the microbial cause of disease may mask this effect. Exposure to domestic animals should be considered a risk factor for human diarrheal illness and additional studies may identify potential mitigation strategies to address this risk.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cysticercosis is caused by the invasion of human or pig tissues by the metacestode larval stage of Taenia solium. In Europe, the disease was endemic in the past but the autochthonous natural life cycle of the parasite is currently completed very rarely. Recently, imported cases have increased in parallel to the increased number of migrations and international travels. The lack of specific surveillance systems for cysticercosis leads to underestimation of the epidemiological and clinical impacts. OBJECTIVES: To review the available data on epidemiology and management of cysticercosis in Europe. METHODS: A review of literature on human cysticercosis and T. solium taeniasis in Europe published between 1990-2011 was conducted. RESULTS: Out of 846 cysticercosis cases described in the literature, 522 cases were autochthonous and 324 cases were imported. The majority (70.1\%) of the autochthonous cases were diagnosed in Portugal from 1983 and 1994. Imported cases of which 242 (74.7\%) diagnosed in migrants and 57 (17.6\%) in European travellers, showed an increasing trend. Most of imported cases were acquired in Latin America (69.8\% of migrants and 44.0\% of travellers). The majority of imported cases were diagnosed in Spain (47.5\%), France (16.7\%) and Italy (8.3\%). One third of neurosurgical procedures were performed because the suspected diagnosis was cerebral neoplasm. Sixty eight autochthonous and 5 imported T. solium taeniasis cases were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Cysticercosis remains a challenge for European care providers, since they are often poorly aware of this infection and have little familiarity in managing this disease. Cysticercosis should be included among mandatory reportable diseases, in order to improve the accuracy of epidemiological information. European health care providers might benefit from a transfer of knowledge from colleagues working in endemic areas and the development of shared diagnostic and therapeutic processes would have impact on the quality of the European health systems.},

	abstract = {The objectives of our study were to evaluate the productive response to methionine supplementation in lactating dairy cows and to define a relationship between metabolizable Met (MP Met) intake and production. A database of 64 papers meeting the selection criteria was developed evaluating postruminally infused dl-methionine (9 papers with 18 control diets and 35 treatment comparisons), 2-hydroxy-4-methylthio butanoic acid (HMTBa) provided as either a liquid or Ca salt form (17 papers with 34 control diets and 46 treatment comparisons), Mepron (Evonik Industries, Essen, Germany; 18 papers with 35 control diets and 42 treatment comparisons), and Smartamine (Adisseo Inc., Antony, France; 20 papers with 30 control diets and 39 treatment comparisons). Dietary ingredients and their accompanying nutritional compositions as described in the reports were entered into the Cornell-Penn-Miner software to model the diets and to predict nutrients that were not reported in the original publication. Data were analyzed using a weighted analysis of response to supplementation compared with the intraexperiment control, as well as through a regression analysis to changing dietary MP Met. Data included in the analysis were from experiments published between 1970 and 2011 with cows supplemented with between 3.5 and 67.9 g of Met or its equivalent from HMTBa. Cows supplemented with Smartamine consumed more, whereas cows supplemented with Mepron consumed less DM compared with controls. Milk yield did not significantly respond to Met supplementation, although it tended to increase for cows supplemented with HMTBa and Mepron. Milk protein yield was increased due to supplementation from all sources or from infusion, and protein concentration was greater for all supplements or infusion of dl-Met, except for cows supplemented with HMTBa. Irrespective of Met source, milk protein yield increased 2.23 g of protein/g of MP Met until reaching the breakpoint. Milk fat yield was increased for Mepron and HMTBa, whereas milk fat concentration was increased for infused dl-Met and for cows supplemented with HMTBa. Based on regression analysis, response of milk fat yield to Met supplementation was not different for infused dl-Met, Mepron, and Smartamine (1.87 g of fat/g of MP Met), whereas the response to HMTBa was significantly greater at 5.38 g of fat/g of MP Met.},

	abstract = {Literature data on utilization of dietary N were analyzed by using meta-analytic procedures for growing milk-fed dairy calves and weaned dairy heifers. The objective was to statistically assess N utilization and excretion in growing dairy cattle when dietary N was altered in otherwise balanced rations at various stages of growth. Studies meeting the selection criteria included data from 16 published papers encompassing 94 distinct observations made on 217 animals. Of these, 6 studied calves were fed milk or milk protein-based milk replacer [milk-fed; 30 to 81 kg of body weight (BW)] with 37 different dietary treatments, and 10 experiments studied heifers receiving diets based on forage, concentrates, or a combination of forage and concentrates (weaned; 56 to 472 kg of BW) with 57 different dietary treatments. Mixed model and fixed effect regression analyses were used to evaluate responses to additional dietary N. True digestibility of dietary N was 100.4\% for milk-fed calves and 96.4\% for weaned heifers, with corresponding basal fecal N excretion values of 3.05 and 6.51 g of N/kg of dry matter intake. Urinary N (g of N/kg of BW(0.75)) was consistently greater for milk-fed calves, but the response to increasing N intake was parallel to the response for weaned heifers. Whether using a mixed model approach or a fixed effect approach to account for metabolizable energy intake, BW, and dry matter intake, milk-fed calves retained more N per kilogram of BW(0.75) than weaned heifers. However, marginal efficiency of N utilization responded as a continuous function of BW, as opposed to a bimodal response associated with diet type. Gross N efficiency (GNE) responded quadratically to N intake and was greater for milk-fed calves than for weaned heifers. Linear and quadratic coefficients of this function did not differ between diet types, indicating that the response in gross N efficiency to additional N intake was not different between diet groups; rather, the absolute level obtainable differed. Dietary CP concentrations of 18.9\% for milk-fed calves and 14.2\% for weaned heifers were found to maximize GNE; 22.5\% MJ of crude protein/MJ of ME was found to maximize GNE for both groups. Equations are discussed relative to the requirements to replace basal N losses and efficiency of N utilization.},

A meta-analytical approach accounting for inter- and intraexperimental variation was used to generate prediction models, and data from recent studies were used to parameterize these models. A total of 10 recently conducted experiments with 43 different dietary treatments fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in this study. Diets of all of the experiments included in this meta-analysis were based on rapidly degradable grain sources, such as barley and wheat, and the findings of this study apply only to these kinds of diets. Data indicated that greater levels of concentrate in the diet were associated with increased concentrations of rumen endotoxin (R(2)=0.27), plasma haptoglobin (R(2)=0.19), and serum amyloid A (SAA) level (R(2)=0.46). Similar correlations, but in opposite directions, were observed between dietary NDF content and rumen endotoxin (R(2)=0.39) and plasma SAA concentrations (R(2)=0.22). The meta-analysis revealed that the relationships between those variables were not linear. Additionally, the breakpoint model fitted to the data of rumen endotoxin, plasma haptoglobin, and SAA indicated the presence of a threshold level of dietary concentrate and NDF, above which those responses became linear to increasing amounts of concentrate or decreasing contents of NDF in the diet. Also, feeding cattle more than 44.1\% concentrate or less than 39.2\% NDF in the diet was associated with a linear increase in the risk of systemic inflammation. Low daily mean rumen pH (R(2)=0.38) and duration of rumen pH {\textless}6.0 (R(2)=0.59) were associated with increased concentrations of endotoxin in the rumen fluid; although those events were not always associated with systemic inflammation. Accordingly, only 15 to 21\% of the overall variation in the responses of SAA was explained by variables of rumen pH, whereas the concentrate level in the diet accounted for 46\% of this variation. In conclusion, data from this study indicated the presence of thresholds of dietary concentrate and NDF levels in the diets based on rapidly fermentable grains beyond which the risk of systemic inflammation in cattle increases linearly.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, BIOSIS, EMBASE, Global Health, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library from inception to December 2014. Two reviewers independently identified all manuscripts pertaining to the administration of ketamine in both human and animal subjects in which the impact on CBF/cerebral vasculature was recorded by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, xenon computed tomography, transcranial Doppler velocities, arteriovenous difference in N2O method of CBF measurement, cerebral digital subtraction angiography, or any other objective means of CBF determination. RESULTS: We identified 38 animal studies with various animal models studied. Overall there was a trend to a direct vasodilatory effect of ketamine on the cerebral vasculature, with a trend in most studies to an increase or regional CBF (rCBF) or global CBF.Twenty human studies were identified. The majority displayed an increase in rCBF and global CBF on imaging in patients without neurological illness. CONCLUSIONS: Animal models indicate an increase in global CBF and rCBF with ketamine administration, with a trend to vasodilation of medium-sized intracranial vessels through a calcium-dependent mechanism. Human studies display an Oxford 2b, Grading of Recommendation Assessment Development and Education C, level of evidence to support a trend to increased global CBF and rCBF with ketamine administration in both healthy volunteers and elective surgical patients without neurological illness.},

Despite the fact that numerous individual studies and a few meta-analyses had been conducted, how grazing, especially its intensity, affects belowground C and N cycling in grasslands remains unclear. In this study, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of 115 published studies to examine the responses of 19 variables associated with belowground C and N cycling to livestock grazing in global grasslands. Our results showed that, on average, grazing significantly decreased belowground C and N pools in grassland ecosystems, with the largest decreases in microbial biomass C and N (21.62\% and 24.40\%, respectively). In contrast, belowground fluxes, including soil respiration, soil net N mineralization and soil N nitrification increased by 4.25\%, 34.67\% and 25.87\%, respectively, in grazed grasslands compared to ungrazed ones. More importantly, grazing intensity significantly affected the magnitude (even direction) of changes in the majority of the assessed belowground C and N pools and fluxes, and C : N ratio as well as soil moisture. Specifically,light grazing contributed to soil C and N sequestration whereas moderate and heavy grazing significantly increased C and N losses. In addition, soil depth, livestock type and climatic conditions influenced the responses of selected variables to livestock grazing to some degree. Our findings highlight the importance of the effects of grazing intensity on belowground C and N cycling, which may need to be incorporated into regional and global models for predicting effects of human disturbance on global grasslands and assessing the climate-biosphere feedbacks.},

Examined factors included: Se source (12 different sources examined), type of chicken (laying hens or broilers), age of birds at the beginning of supplementation, duration of supplementation, year during which the study was conducted, sex of birds, number of chickens per treatment, method of analysis, tissue type, concentration of Se determined and Se added to feed. A correlation analysis was also carried out between tissue Se concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity. Data analysis showed that the factors significantly affecting tissue Se concentration include type of chicken (P=0.006), type of tissue (P{\textless}0.001) and the analytical method used (P=0.014). Although Se source was not found to affect tissue Se concentration (overall P{\textgreater}0.05), certain inorganic (sodium selenite), calcium selenite, sodium selenate and organic sources (B-Traxim Se), Se-yeast, Se-malt, Se-enriched cabbage and Se-enriched garlic as well as background Se level from feed ingredients were found to significantly affect tissue Se concentration. The Se accumulation rate (estimated as linear regression coefficient of Se concentrations to Se added to feed) discriminated between the various tissues with highest values estimated in the leg muscle and lowest in blood plasma. Correlation analysis has also shown that tissue Se concentration (pooled data) was correlated to Se added to feed (r=0.529, P{\textless}0.01, log values) and to glutathione peroxidase activity (r=0.332, P=0.0478), with the latter not being correlated with Se added to feed. Although significant factors affecting Se concentration were reported in the present study, they do not necessarily indicate the in vivo function of the antioxidant system or the level of accumulated Se as other factors, not examined in the present study, may interact at the level of trace element absorption, distribution and retention.},

	title = {{NTP} monograph on the systematic review of occupational exposure to cancer chemotherapy agents and adverse health outcomes},
	doi = {10.22427/ntp-mgraph-5},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Many cancer chemotherapy agents are known carcinogens, genetic toxicants, and developmental toxicants. Secondary malignancies, such as therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia, are caused by cancer chemotherapy agents administered to patients for the treatment of cancer. Occupational exposure to these agents was first documented in the 1970s and continues to occur, despite the issuance of safe handling guidelines in 1980s. OBJECTIVES: Based on the evidence of carcinogenicity and genetic toxicity associated with direct administration of cancer chemotherapy agents and current evidence of occupational exposure, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) conducted a systematic review to: (1) evaluate whether occupational exposure (e.g., medical, manufacturing, research, and veterinary) is associated with any adverse health outcomes in humans, and (2) summarize the prevalence and levels of chemotherapy agents in the workplace as measured by environmental monitoring and biomonitoring for possible worker exposures. METHODS: The evaluation was conducted following the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) method. A literature search was performed up to February 23, 2017, using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Toxline, and Web of Science. Relevant human studies were data extracted and assessed for risk of bias. Bodies of evidence were assessed to develop confidence ratings and level-of-evidence conclusions that reflect the certainty in the evidence that occupational exposure to cancer chemotherapy agents are associated with health effects on a per outcome basis. RESULTS AND EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The literature search and screening process identified 110 epidemiological studies relevant to assessing possible adverse health outcomes. Most studies addressing health outcomes evaluated potential DNA damage (n = 66; specifically, structural chromosomal aberrations (CA) and micronucleus (MN) induction and comet assay endpoints) and spontaneous abortion (n = 16). In addition to DNA damage, groups of studies were identified to evaluate the potential association between occupational exposure to cancer chemotherapy agents and adverse health outcomes, including cancer (three studies) and adverse effects on reproduction (30 studies). Additional health outcomes included acute effects, immune effects, and liver and kidney toxicity. One hundred seventy-one studies were identified to assess workplace exposure based on reporting of environmental contamination (107 studies) and urine and/or blood monitoring of these agents (82 studies). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: NTP concluded that there is a moderate level of evidence that occupational exposure to chemotherapy agents is associated with increased incidence of spontaneous abortion, particularly when evaluating studies of nursing and pharmacy personnel. NTP also concluded that there is a moderate level of evidence that exposure to chemotherapy agents in the workplace is associated with genetic toxicity in humans based on consistent reports significantly higher levels of structural CA (\% of cells with CA and number of CA), MN induction (number of cells with MN and number of MN) and DNA damage measured by comet assay (\% tail DNA, tail length, tail moment, and DNA damage index) in exposed personnel. There was inadequate evidence for NTP to reach level-of-evidence conclusions on the remaining health outcomes, including cancer, primarily due to few studies per outcome and heterogeneity in the data. Despite current safety guidelines, cancer chemotherapy agents were commonly detected in environmental samples of the workplace (e.g., surface wipes and air sampling) and biosamples (e.g., urine or blood) of workers handling these agents, including data collected as recently as 2014 to 2016. Considering the potential for occupational exposure to these agents and the association between exposure and DNA damage and spontaneous abortions, there is a continued need to reduce exposures through training in safe handling procedures and provision and use of personal protective equipment and associated safety containment equipment. Health surveillance of occupationally exposed personnel would also benefit from improved exposure characterization methods, such as use of daily diaries that are assessed and validated to estimate exposure levels and additional environmental monitoring and biomonitoring data that include analytical chemistry approaches to assess multiple agents. There is also a need to better understand the sources (i.e., activities or physical locations) of worker exposure, especially in settings that have not been adequately studied (e.g., home care, veterinary clinics).},

There is much evidence regarding prevalence of Leishmania RNAvirus (LRV) causing Old World leishmaniasis (OWL) and New World leishmaniasis (NWL); however, a combined evidence-based knowledge on this topic is not still available. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to address the global status of synchronizing LRV in Leishmania in the available literature. The data were systematically collected from the English electronic databases up to May 2018. Then, the studies were screened based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The random-effect model was used by forest plot with 95\% confidence interval (CI). Overall, 877 samples from 17 articles were included in this study. Given species of Leishmania, the highest prevalence of LRV belonged to Leishmania (L.) Viannia (V.) guyanensis and L. V. braziliensis. Additionally, the virus was detected also in L. V. amazonensis, L. V. panamanensis, L. V. lainsoni, L. aethiopica, L. major and L. infantum. By random-effect model, the global prevalence of LRV was estimated to be 26.2\% (95\% CI: 14.4\% - 40.1\%). The high prevalence of LRV among causative agents of NWLisolated from the metastatic clinical forms suggests potential association of LRV with metastatic clinical forms in New World endemic regions. A comprehensive investigation on experimental and clinical aspects of LRV is needed to fully appraise the role of these viruses in pathogenicity of Leishmania parasites and their drug resistance.},

This study aims to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the data on the prevalence of Naegleria spp. in water sources in the available literature. Included articles on the prevalence of Naegleria spp. in water sources in PubMed, Google Scholar, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science were systematically searched between January 1977 and September 2019. Regarding meta-analysis, the random-effect model was employed by forest plot with 95\% of confidence interval (CI). The meta-analysis considered 103 articles surveying the prevalence of Naegleria spp. in various water sources. The pooled worldwide prevalence of Naegleria spp. across 35 countries was 26.42\% (95\% CI = 21.52-31.63). The subgroup analysis reported that the pooled worldwide prevalence of N. fowleri is 23.27\%, N. australiensis 9.12\%, N. lovaniensis 7.68\%, N. pagei 5.95, N. polaris 5.17\%, N. gruberi 3.95\%, N. clarki 3.54\%, N. americana 3.19\%, N. philippinensis 1.99\% and N. dobsoni 1.73\%. This is the first systematic review on the prevalence of Naegleria spp. in water sources. Our findings suggest a wide distribution of Naegleria spp., including potential pathogenic species such as N. fowleri, in water sources all over the world. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to provide comprehensive data and systematic analysis regarding the prevalence of Naegleria spp. in water sources. Accordingly, further studies are highly recommended to investigate the presence of pathogenic N. fowleri in other countries.},

	doi = {10.7717/peerj.6260},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing human population and global intensification of agriculture have had a major impact on the world's natural ecosystems and caused devastating effects on populations of mega-herbivores such as the African savanna elephants, through habitat reduction and fragmentation and increased human-animal conflict. Animals with vast home ranges are forced into increasingly smaller geographical areas, often restricted by fencing or encroaching anthropogenic activities, resulting in huge pressures on these areas to meet the animals' resource needs. This can present a nutritional challenge and cause animals to adapt their movement patterns to meet their dietary needs for specific minerals, potentially causing human-animal conflict. The aim of this review is to consolidate understanding of nutritional drivers for animal movement, especially that of African savanna elephants and focus the direction of future research. Peer reviewed literature available was generally geographically specific and studies conducted on isolated populations of individual species. African savanna elephants have the capacity to extensively alter the landscape and have been more greatly studied than other herbivores, making them a good example species to use for this review. Alongside this, their movement choices, potentially linked with nutritional drivers could be applicable to a range of other species. Relevant case study examples of other herbivores moving based on nutritional needs are discussed. METHODS: Three databases were searched in this review: Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar, using identified search terms. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were determined and applied as required. Additional grey literature was reviewed as appropriate. RESULTS: Initial searches yielded 1,870 records prior to application of inclusion and exclusion criteria. A less detailed review of grey literature, and additional peer-reviewed literature which did not meet the inclusion criteria but was deemed relevant by the authors was also conducted to ensure thorough coverage of the subject. DISCUSSION: A review of peer reviewed literature was undertaken to examine nutritional drivers for African elephant movement, exploring documented examples from free-ranging African savanna elephants and, where relevant, other herbivore species. This could help inform prediction or mitigation of human-elephant conflict, potentially when animals move according to nutritional needs, and related drivers for this movement. In addition, appropriate grey literature was included to capture current research.},

	abstract = {Background: Worldwide, horses play critical roles in recreation, food production, transportation, and as working animals. Horses' roles differ by geographical region and the socioeconomic status of the people, but despite modern advances in transportation, which have in some ways altered humans contact with horses, potential risks for equine zoonotic pathogen transmission to humans occur globally. While previous reports have focused upon individual or groups of equine pathogens, to our knowledge, a systematic review of equine zoonoses has never been performed. Methods: Using PRISMA's systematic review guidelines, we searched the English literature and identified 233 previous reports of potential equine zoonoses found in horses. We studied and summarized their findings with a goal of identifying risk factors that favor disease transmission from horses to humans. Results: These previous reports identified 56 zoonotic pathogens that have been found in horses. Of the 233 articles, 13 involved direct transmission to humans (5.6\%).The main potential routes of transmission included oral, inhalation, and cutaneous exposures. Pathogens most often manifest in humans through systemic, gastrointestinal, and dermatological signs and symptoms. Furthermore, 16.1\% were classified as emerging infectious diseases and thus may be less known to both the equine and human medical community. Sometimes, these infections were severe leading to human and equine death. Conclusions: While case reports of zoonotic infections directly from horses remain low, there is a high potential for underreporting due to lack of knowledge among health professionals. Awareness of these zoonotic pathogens, their disease presentation in horses and humans, and their associated risk factors for cross-species infection are important to public health officials, clinicians, and people with recreational or occupational equid exposure.},

The present review aimed to summarize the current evidence on the association of fish consumption and dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs with hip fracture. The online databases of PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, Science Direct and Embase were searched until August 2017 for related publications using relevant keywords. To pool data, either a fixed-effects model or random-effects models were used. Cochran's Q tests were used to assess heterogeneity between studies. In total, 10 studies (7 prospective and 3 case-control studies) were included in this systematic review, and 9 studies with total sample size of 292657 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The age of participants was 20 years or older. Combining 8 effect sizes from 4 prospective studies and 2 case-control studies revealed a significant inverse association between fish consumption and risk of hip fracture (pooled effect size: 0.88, 95\% CI: 0.79-0.98, P = 0.02). Although this relationship became non-significant in prospective studies, a significant inverse association was found in prospective studies with sample size of 10000 individuals or more, and studies that considered body mass index as a covariate. Furthermore, dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs was inversely associated with risk of hip fracture (pooled effect size: 0.89, 95\% CI: 0.80-0.99, P = 0.02). Also, such relationship was seen after excluding one case-control study and combining effect sizes only from prospective studies (pooled effect size: 0.88, 95\% CI: 0.80-0.98, P = 0.02). In conclusion, we found that fish consumption and dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs might have protective effects on bone health and decline the risk of hip fracture.},

OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and safety of HBC for reducing NEC, mortality, sepsis, time to full-feed and feeding intolerance in preterm infants. DATA SOURCES: We conducted searches through Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and gray literature. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials comparing human or bovine colostrum to placebo. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently did screening, review, and extraction. RESULTS: Eight studies (385 infants) proved eligible. In comparison with placebo, HBC revealed no effect on the incidence of severe NEC (relative risk [RR]: 0.99; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.48 to 2.02, I(2) = 2.2\%; moderate certainty of evidence), all-cause mortality (RR: 0.88; 95\% CI 0.39 to 1.82, I(2) = 0\%; moderate certainty), culture-proven sepsis (RR: 0.78; 95\% CI 0.53 to 1.14, I(2) = 0\%; moderate certainty), and feed intolerance (RR: 0.97; 95\% CI 0.37 to 2.56, I(2) = 55\%; low certainty). HBC revealed a significant effect on reducing the mean days to reach full enteral feed (mean difference: -3.55; 95\% CI 0.33 to 6.77, I(2) = 41.1\%; moderate certainty). The indirect comparison of bovine versus human colostrum revealed no difference in any outcome. LIMITATIONS: The number of patients was modest, whereas the number of NEC-related events was low. CONCLUSIONS: Bovine or human colostrum has no effect on severe NEC, mortality, culture-proven sepsis, feed intolerance, or length of stay. Additional research focused on the impact on enteral feeding may be needed to confirm the findings on this outcome.},

	abstract = {Lameness resulting from claw lesions remains a pressing welfare issue in dairy cows. Claw trimming (CT) is a common practice for prevention and management of clinically lame cows. This review summarizes the results of studies that have investigated various claw trimming (CT) methods, their application in lameness management, and associations with the welfare and production of dairy cows. The papers included in this review fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: published in peer review journal or book chapter within the last 20 years (1999-2019), written in English, and focused on the application of CT for lameness management and the association with either welfare or production variables. Databases used included Google scholar, Web of Science and PubMed. A total of 748 records were assessed and 61 papers were eligible for inclusion and the main objectives and results were used to categorize the results under six topics: CT techniques, association between CT and claw overgrowth/specific claw lesions, timing and frequency of CT, association between CT and behavioral variables, association between CT and physiological parameters, and association between CT and production. The literature findings showed the existence of various CT methods with the common types including the Dutch Five-step, White Line, White Line Atlas, and Kansas techniques. There is data paucity on the efficacy of these techniques in lameness management; however, the slight procedural difference yields varying sole thicknesses and presentations which may influence their prophylactic use. Results regarding the impact of CT on welfare and production were discussed in relation to potential short and long-term benefits. Depending on the lesion type and severity level, CT may induce immediate painful sensation, stress, changes in lying down activities and reduction in milk yield, but the positive impacts were more evident at later stages of lactation following improvement in locomotion score. The majority of the reviewed studies were lacking a detailed description of CT techniques and claw health of the studied animals; thus, reducing the strength of demonstrating CT-related benefits. However, electronic recording of claw health data during every CT visit provides the basis for monitoring hoof health and could assist in curtailing some of these challenges. To elucidate CT-related benefits, certain areas requiring further research were highlighted such as ascertaining the appropriate timing for preventive CT and identifying cows that will benefit more from such intervention during lactation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Equine gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) have been the subject of intermittent studies in Australia over the past few decades. However, comprehensive information on the epidemiology of equine GINs, the efficacy of available anthelmintic drugs and the prevalence of anthelmintic resistance (AR) in Australasia is lacking. Herein, we have systematically reviewed existing knowledge on the horse GINs recorded in Australia, and main aspects of their pathogeneses, epidemiology, diagnoses, treatment and control. METHODS: Six electronic databases were searched for publications on GINs of Australian horses that met our inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Subsets of publications were subjected to review epidemiology, diagnoses, pathogeneses, treatment and control of GINs of horses from Australia. RESULTS: A total of 51 articles published between 1950 to 2018 were included. The main GINs reported in Australian horses were cyathostomins (at least 28 species), Draschia megastoma, Habronema muscae, H. majus, Oxyuris equi, Parascaris equorum, Strongyloides westeri and Trichostrongylus axei across different climatic regions of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia. Nematodes are diagnosed based on the traditional McMaster egg counting technique, though molecular markers to characterise common GINs of equines were characterised in 1990s. The use of anthelmintic drugs remains the most widely-used strategy for controlling equine GIN parasites in Australia; however, the threshold of faecal egg count that should trigger treatment in horses, remains controversial. Furthermore, anthelmintic resistance within GIN population of horses is becoming a common problem in Australia. CONCLUSIONS: Although GINs infecting Australian horses have been the subject of occasional studies over the past few decades, the effective control of GIN infections is hampered by a generalised lack of knowledge in various disciplines of equine parasitology. Therefore, coordinated and focused research is required to fill our knowledge gaps in these areas to maximise equine health and minimise economic losses associated with the parasitic infections in Australia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antimony (Sb) trioxide and antimony trisulfide are "2B: Possibly carcinogenic to humans" and "3: Unclassifiable" according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) concluded that antimony trioxide "is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on studies in rats and mice". We investigated the cancer hazard of antimony compounds for workers, a population with high exposure to antimony substances. METHODS: Using the "Guidelines for performing systematic reviews in the development of toxicity factors" (Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) 2017) as a guidance, we established a human and an animal toxicology data stream in Medline and ToxLine. Data from this review were applied in a human health risk assessment. RESULTS: A final pool of 10 occupational and 13 animal toxicology articles resulted after application of TCEQ guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Antimony carcinogenicity evidence involving workers is inadequate, based on confounding, small sample sizes, incomparability across studies, and inadequate reference populations. An increased lung cancer risk cannot be excluded. Evidence for lung neoplasms caused by antimony trioxide inhalation in experimental animals is sufficient. Overall, carcinogenicity in workers is probable (International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) 2A). It remains unclear from what occupational exposure duration and dose this effect arises and whether exposure threshold values should be reconsidered.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Decreases in clinical response of Clostridioides difficile to antibiotics used for its treatment have raised concerns regarding antibiotic resistance. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to study the resistance rates of C. difficile to various antibiotics over time. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science from inception through 03/31/2017 for observational studies assessing antibiotic resistance rates in C. difficile. Weighted summary estimates were calculated using inverse variance heterogeneity models [MetaXL software (v. 5.3)]. A priori subgroup analyses were done (by study year, continent, susceptibility testing method, origin of isolates); ribotype 027 strains were analyzed separately. RESULTS: From 1982 to 2017, 60 studies (8336 isolates) were analyzed. Fifty-three studies reported vancomycin resistance; weighted pooled resistance (WPR), 2.1\% (95\% CI, 0\%-5.1\%; I(2) = 95\%). Fifty-five studies reported metronidazole resistance; WPR, 1.9\% (95\% CI, 0.5\%-3.6\%; I(2) = 89\%). Compared to the period before 2012, vancomycin resistance increased by 3.6\% (95\% CI, 2.9\%-4.2\%; P {\textless} 0.001) after 2012, and metronidazole resistance decreased by 0.8\% (95\% CI, 0.1\%-1.5\%; P = 0.02). No isolates were resistant to fidaxomicin. CONCLUSION: Resistance of C. difficile to vancomycin is increasing, with a smaller, declining resistance to metronidazole; there is significant heterogeneity between studies. Ongoing monitoring of resistance to commonly used antibiotics is required.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is an increasing global health problem, but its treatment is not yet optimal, especially in the long term. For this reason, preclinical studies have been conducted relating to a new therapeutic strategy for obesity based on adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs). The aim of our systematic review is to summarize these findings deriving from the animal model in order to establish whether there is sufficient evidence to justify going forward to clinical studies. METHODS: Literature searches, study selection, methods and quality appraisal were performed as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data were collated using a narrative approach. RESULTS: Of the 578 articles retrieved, seven studies met the inclusion criteria, and their analysis revealed several main findings. There was a strong evidence of the positive effect of AD-MSCs in obesity treatment in terms of body weight, glucose metabolism homeostasis, lipid profiles, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and systemic inflammation. Moreover, there was recent evidence from a few studies for a significant effect of AD-MSCs transplantation on the improvement of obesity-related hormonal status, (i.e., leptin) and body composition patterns, though these investigations may need further replication. CONCLUSION: The effects of AD-MSCs transplantation on obesity, in terms of weight loss and obesityrelated diseases, are promising in animal models. In the future, further well-designed studies should be performed to understand the mechanism of action and to overcome some methodological limitations such as the small sample sizes and risk of bias evidenced in our systematic review, before moving forward to assess AD-MSCs as a potential strategy for human obesity management.},

However, it seems that the antioxidant activity of artichoke has not yet been reviewed.

We searched four electronic databases till April 2018 using relevant keywords. All English language articles were assessed. For animal studies, standardized mean difference was pooled using a random effects model. The included studies were evaluated for eligibility and risk of bias. Thirty-nine articles (two human, 23 animal, and 14 in vitro studies) were reviewed. The results of in vitro systems supported the antioxidant effect of artichoke, whereas limited clinical trials indicated no change or a slight improvement of antioxidant status. Finding of animal studies indicated that artichoke extract supplementation increased superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase level in liver, as well as, decreased malondialdehyde level in liver and plasma of animals with induced disease significantly compared with comparison group. This meta-analysis provided convincing evidence for antioxidant activity of artichoke in animals.},

	abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a major threat to human and animal health. Part of the AMR dimension is the circulation of extended-spectrum β-lactamases producing-Escherichia coli (ESBL-E. coli), which is now commonly reported among companion animals. However, the global perspective of the prevalence and population structure of ESBL-E. coli circulating in dogs and cats has not been estimated limiting our understanding of their role in the dissemination of ESBL-E. coli. The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of ESBL-E. coli between dogs and cats and across countries through meta-analysis. We also performed a scoping review to summarize the current knowledge on ESBL genes and E. coli clones circulating among companion animals. A total of 128 studies published in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus up to April 2020 were selected and contained information on prevalence and/or molecular characterization of ESBL genes and ESBL-E. coli clones. Our review shows an increase in the number of publications between 2000 and 2019, concentrated mainly in Europe. Prevalence varied across continents, ranging from 0.63\% (Oceania) to 16.56\% (Africa) in dogs and from 0\% (Oceania) to 16.82\% (Asia) in cats. Although there were twice as many studies reporting prevalence on dogs (n = 61) than on cats (n = 32), and only 9 studies focused exclusively on cats, our meta-analysis showed no difference in the global prevalence of ESBL-E. coli between dogs (6.87\% [95\% CI: 4.46-10.45\%]) and cats (5.04\% [95\% CI: 2.42-10.22\%]). A considerable diversity of ESBL genes (n = 60) and sequence types (ST) (n = 171) were recovered from companion animals. ESBL-E. coli encoded by CTX-M-15 (67.5\%, 77/114) and SHV-12 (21.9\%, 25/114), along with resistant strains of ST38 (22.7\%, 15/66) and ST131 (50\%, 33/66) were widespread and detected in all continents. While presence of ESBL-E. coli is widespread, the drivers influencing the observed ESBL-E. coli prevalence and the clinical relevance in veterinary medicine and public health along with economic impact of ESBL-E. coli infections among companion animals need to be further investigated.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Although chemotherapeutic agents have highly beneficial effects against cancer, they disturb the body's normal homeostasis. One of the critical side effects of chemotherapeutic agents is their deleterious effect on the cardiac system, which causes limitations of their clinical usage. Taurine constitutes more than 50\% of the amino acids in the heart. The use of taurine might prevent chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. This systematic study aims to evaluate the protective role of taurine against cardiotoxicity induced by chemotherapy. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in databases up to November 2020, and the review is designed on PRISMA guidelines. The search keywords were selected based on our study target and were searched in the title and abstract. After the consecutive screening, out of a whole of 94 articles, 8 articles were included according to our inclusion and exclusion criteria. KEY FINDINGS: According to the study results, chemotherapy decreases body and heart weight and increases mortality. Also, it induces some biochemical and histological changes compared to the control group. By co-administration of taurine with chemotherapy, alterations returned near to the average level. These protective effects of taurine are mediated through anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. SIGNIFICANCE: Based on evaluated non-clinical studies, taurine ameliorates chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity, but its possible interaction with the efficacy of anti-cancer medicines that mostly act through induction of oxidants remains to be elucidated in the future. This needs conducting well-designed studies to assess the effectiveness and safety of this combination simultaneously.},

	abstract = {Body condition metrics are widely used to infer animal health and to assess costs of parasite infection. Since parasites harm their hosts, ecologists might expect negative relationships between infection and condition in wildlife, but this assumption is challenged by studies showing positive or null condition-infection relationships. Here, we outline common condition metrics used by ecologists in studies of parasitism, and consider mechanisms that cause negative, positive, and null condition-infection relationships in wildlife systems. We then perform a meta-analysis of 553 condition-infection relationships from 187 peer-reviewed studies of animal hosts, analysing observational and experimental records separately, and noting whether authors measured binary infection status or intensity. Our analysis finds substantial heterogeneity in the strength and direction of condition-infection relationships, a small, negative average effect size that is stronger in experimental studies, and evidence for publication bias towards negative relationships. The strongest predictors of variation in study outcomes are host thermoregulation and the methods used to evaluate body condition. We recommend that studies aiming to assess parasite impacts on body condition should consider host-parasite biology, choose condition measures that can change during the course of infection, and employ longitudinal surveys or manipulate infection status when feasible.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted to compare the effects of feeding dairy cows conventional sorghum silage (CSS) or conventional corn silage (CCS) compared with brown midrib sorghum silage (BMRSS) diets on dry matter intake (DMI), milk production, and milk composition. Data from 9 published articles (1984 to 2015) were used to contrast diets with CSS (7 means comparisons; 104 cows) or CCS (13 means comparisons; 204 cows) versus BMRSS diets. Statistical analysis was performed using fixed or random effects models with the Metafor package of R (https://www.R-project.org). The degree of heterogeneity was measured with the I(2) statistic, and publication bias was determined with funnel plots and Egger's regression test. Other sources of heterogeneity of response were analyzed through meta-regression. Estimated effect size was calculated for DMI, milk production, and milk composition. No evidence of publication bias was observed for any variable tested. The highest degree of heterogeneity (I(2) = 41.5 and 72.6\%) was observed for DMI among dependent variables tested in both comparisons, indicating that intake responses to silage type are rather inconsistent; in contrast, milk production had the lowest degree of heterogeneity (I(2) = 0\%), supporting the idea that the responses of this variable to silage type were very consistent across studies. Compared with BMRSS diets, cows fed CSS diets exhibited decreased milk production (1.64 kg/d), milk fat concentration (0.09\%), milk fat yield (0.08 kg/d), milk protein yield (0.04 kg/d), and milk lactose yield (0.16 kg/d) and tended to decrease DMI (0.83 kg/d). Compared with CCS diets, cows fed BMRSS diets increased milk fat concentration (0.10\%), but decreased milk protein concentration (0.06\%) and tended to increase lactose yield (0.08 kg/d). Meta-regression indicated that days in milk affected DMI and milk production when CSS diets were compared with BMRSS diets, and DMI when CCS diets were compared with BMRSS diets. Additionally, the inclusion rate of silage in the diet and dietary neutral detergent fiber affected yields of milk fat and lactose, respectively, when CCS and BMRSS diets were compared. Overall, lactation performance improved when cows were fed diets formulated with BMRSS compared with CSS, but performance was not different for cows fed BMRSS and CCS diets. However, the small sample size may have influenced these results by increasing the margin of the error and, concurrently, the power of the meta-analysis. Results of this analysis suggest that additional research is needed to explore the effects of days in milk and the inclusion rates of silages in the diets when comparing BMRSS with CSS or CCS.},

	abstract = {One of the most critical threats to biodiversity is the high extinction rate driven by human activities. Reducing extinction rates requires the implementation of conservation programmes based on robust scientific data. Elasmobranchs are important ecological components of the ocean, and several species sustain substantial economic activities. Unfortunately, elasmobranchs are one of the most threatened and understudied animal taxa. The Mexican Pacific Coast (MPC) is a region with high elasmobranch diversity and is the seat of major elasmobranch fisheries. But it is also a developing region with several conservation and management challenges which require national and international attention. Here, we review the conservation genetics literature of elasmobranchs from the MPC. We present a synthesis of the works using samples from the region and emphasize the main gaps and biases in these data. In addition, we discuss the benefits and challenges of generating genomic information to improve the management and conservation of an elasmobranch biodiversity hotspot in a developing country. We found 47 elasmobranch genetic articles that cover {\textless}30\% of the elasmobranch diversity in the region. These studies mainly used mitochondrial DNA sequences to analyse the genetic structure of commercially important and abundant species of the order Carcharhiniformes. Some of these papers also assessed mating systems, demographic parameters, and taxonomic uncertainties, all of which are important topics for efficient management decisions. In terms of conservation genetics, elasmobranchs from the MPC remain understudied. However, high-throughput sequencing technologies have increased the power and accessibility of genomic tools, even in developing countries such as Mexico. The tools described here provide information relevant for biodiversity conservation. Therefore, we strongly suggest that investment in genomic research will assist implementation of efficient management strategies. In time, this will reduce the extinction risk of the unique elasmobranch biodiversity from the MPC.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.clnu.2020.09.027},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: The integrity of the intestinal barrier in the diseased is key to prevent further complications and disease such as sepsis and death, whereas, the role of food bioactive molecules (i. e. phenolic compounds (PCs) on the intestinal barrier, is still unknown. The current aim was to explore the benefits of the oral PC administration on the intestinal barrier integrity in animals. METHODS: The effects of PCs on the intestinal barrier integrity in in vivo animal models of intestinal inflammation were assessed up-to August 2020 from the PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library databases under the PRISMA methodology. The risk of bias was assessed from ARRAY and SCYRCLE tools. RESULTS: From 1241 articles, 14 studies were included. In animals, oral resveratrol (n = 6) improves the intestinal barrier integrity and reduces intestinal damage. Additionally, grape seed extract (n = 2), curcumin (n = 1), genistein (n = 1), chlorogenic acid (n = 1), grape pomace (n = 1), olive leaf (n = 1) or cranberry extract (n = 1) improve the intestinal barrier integrity downregulating various inflammatory molecules (TNF-α, and other interleukins), and increasing the antioxidant enzymes in animals. Furthermore, resveratrol, quercetin, epigallocatechin, and other PCs improve the epithelial barrier integrity and pro-inflammatory molecule expression in the intestinal epithelia. CONCLUSIONS: The oral PC administration in animals improves the intestinal barrier integrity and function from three main mechanisms: 1) The reduction of pro-inflammatory molecules, 2) the improvement in tight-junction protein expression, and 3) the improvement of the antioxidant intracellular activity suggesting the potential use of PCs in the management of intestinal injury in humans, particularly for resveratrol, the most studied PC.},

However, the association between circulating levels of BDNF and obesity is still not defined. To answer this question, we performed a meta-analysis carrying out a systematic search in electronic databases. Ten studies (307 obese patients and 236 controls) were included in the analysis. Our data show that obese patients have levels of BDNF similar to those of controls (SMD: 0.01, 95\% CI: -0.28, 0.30, p=0.94). The lack of difference was further confirmed both in studies in which BDNF levels were assessed in serum (MD: -0.93 ng/mL, 95\% CI: -3.34, 1.48, p=0.45) and in plasma (MD: 0.15 ng/mL, 95\% CI: -0.09, 0.39, p=0.23). Data evaluation has shown that some bias might affect BDNF measurements (e.g., subject recruitment, procedures of sampling, handling, and storage), leading to a difficult interpretation of the results. Standardization of the procedures is still needed to reach strong, affordable, and reliable conclusions.},

Several trials have assessed vaccine efficacy in livestock but there have been no attempts to evaluate these trials jointly. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate vaccine efficacy to prevent urinary shedding of Leptospira serovar Hardjo (Hardjo) in cattle. Three databases were used to search for relevant papers published from 1980 to 2015 evaluating commercial vaccines to prevent urinary shedding of leptospires after artificial conjunctival or natural challenge. A total of 1237 articles were initially identified. Eight articles containing information from nine trials that assessed vaccine efficacy to prevent Hardjo urinary shedding, as per bacteriological culture, were included in the meta-analysis. Fixed effects Mantel-Haenszel (MH) and a Bayesian random effects meta-analyses were used to estimate the efficacy of vaccination to prevent Hardjo shedding in urine. Vaccine efficacy against Hardjo challenge was 88.7\% (95\% CI 81.0\%-93.2\%) in the MH meta-analysis and 89.9\% (95\% probability interval 80.6\%-94.9\%) in the Bayesian random effects meta-analysis. There was no evidence of heterogeneity of study results (p = 0.17). The estimated vaccine efficacy to prevent urinary shedding of Hardjo in cattle may be sufficient to reduce disease incidence in animals and exposure risk of people working in close contact with cattle.},

	abstract = {AIMS: The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature for evidence of the effect of a high-fat diet (HFD) on the onset or progression of osteoarthritis (OA) in mice. METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus to find all studies on mice investigating the effects of HFD or Western-type diet on OA when compared with a control diet (CD). The primary outcome was the determination of cartilage loss and alteration. Secondary outcomes regarding local and systemic levels of proteins involved in inflammatory processes or cartilage metabolism were also examined when reported. RESULTS: In total, 14 publications met our inclusion criteria and were included in our review. Our meta-analysis showed that, when measured by the modified Mankin Histological-Histochemical Grading System, there was a significantly higher rate of OA in mice fed a HFD than in mice on a CD (standardized mean difference (SMD) 1.27, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 1.91). Using the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) score, there was a trend towards HFD causing OA (SMD 0.78, 95\% CI -0.04 to 1.61). In terms of OA progression, a HFD consistently worsened the progression of surgically induced OA when compared with a CD. Finally, numerous inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and leptin, among others, were found to be altered by a HFD. CONCLUSION: A HFD seems to induce or exacerbate the progression of OA in mice. The metabolic changes and systemic inflammation brought about by a HFD appear to be key players in the onset and progression of OA.Cite this article: Bone Joint Res 2019;8:582-592.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To systematically review and evaluate what is known regarding contemporary biological therapy capable of accelerating orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) in animal model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MedLine, Scopus, Web of Science and OpenGrey were searched without restrictions until June 2019. Following study retrieval and selection, relevant data was extracted using a standardized table. Risk of bias (RoB) assessment was performed using the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) tool. RESULTS: Fifty-one animal studies were included. Two biological therapies were identified as capable of accelerating the OTM: chemical methods (49 studies) and gene therapy (2 studies). The main substances that increased the OTM rate were cytokines (13 studies), followed by growth factors (6 studies) and hormones (5 studies). Most studies were assessed to be at unclear or high RoB. The application protocols, measurement and reporting of outcomes varied widely and methodologies were not adequately reported. CONCLUSIONS: Although biological therapies to accelerate OTM have been widely tested and effective in preclinical studies, the validity of the evidence is flawed to support translational of these results. There is a need for well-designed experimental studies to translate these methods for clinical field.},

	abstract = {Biomarkers of antioxidant and biotransformation systems are commonly used to assess polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) pollution in fish. Despite their extensive application of biomarkers, contradictory results are vastly reported in the literature, even for the same species in similar contamination scenarios. This study aims to verify response patterns of biomarkers in fish exposed to PAHs. Through systematic reviews and meta-analyses, we were able to evaluate: (i) overall magnitude of PAHs effects on biotransformation and oxidative stress biomarkers; (ii) patterns of response among experimental approaches (laboratory, field and active biomonitoring), environment (marine and freshwater) and fish habitat (pelagic, demersal, etc.); (iii) effects of exposure route, time and concentration of PAHs; and (iv) which biomarkers respond best to PAHs exposure. Overall, biomarker responses were significantly affected by PAHs exposure. The activities of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and lipid peroxide (LPO) significantly increased in fish exposed to PAHs, whereas catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities and levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) were not affected. Amongst responsive biomarkers, EROD and GST activities significantly differed among approaches and between marine and freshwater environments, but were not affected by fish habitat. GSSG levels were higher in fish from laboratory bioassays compared to the field, but did not differ between environments nor habitats. Exposure route played a major role only for GST and GPx responses. Finally, increasing PAHs concentration and exposure time had a significant effect on all assessed biomarkers, except for CAT. We conclude that EROD and GST are robust biomarkers to assess PAHs effects in fish. Contrarily, CAT is an inadequate biomarker of PAHs exposure since no significant response was observed. Our study also highlighted some research gaps in PAHs contamination studies, such as a clear lack of active biomonitoring experiments.},

We carried out an umbrella review (UR) of systematic reviews (SRs), created for the purpose of exploring the literature and aimed at deepening the terminological and methodological aspects of AAIs. It is created by exploring the online databases PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library. The SRs present in the high-impact indexed search engines Web of Sciences and Scopus are selected. After screening, we selected 15 SRs that met the inclusion criteria. All papers complained of the poor quality of AAIs; some considered articles containing interventions that did not always correspond to the terminology they have explored and whose operating practices were not always comparable. This stresses the need for the development and consequent diffusion of not only operational protocols, but also research protocols which provide for the homogeneous use of universally recognized terminologies, thus facilitating the study, deepening, and comparison between the numerous experiences described.},

Forty-two experiments, including 134 treatment means and 1,803 cows, were included in the meta-analysis. Of those, 5 experiments with 15 treatment means reported responses for 151 nulliparous cows. Data collected included the mineral composition of prepartum diets, parity group prepartum, breed, days on treatment, and means and respective measure of variance for urine pH, dry matter intake (DMI), body weight, body condition, productive performance, concentrations of minerals and metabolites in blood, and incidence of diseases. Mixed effects meta-analyses were conducted weighting by the inverse of standard error of the means squared to account for the precision of each experiment. Models include the effects of DCAD, parity group prepartum, interaction between DCAD and parity group, and other covariates that showed significance in univariable analysis. Final models were selected based on parsimony and model fit. Reducing the prepartum DCAD reduced intake prepartum but improved intake postpartum in both parity groups. Interactions between DCAD and parity group occurred for yields of milk, fat-corrected milk (FCM), fat, and protein because reducing the DCAD improved those responses in parous cows; however, reducing the DCAD either had no effect on yields of milk and protein or reduced the yield of FCM and fat in nulliparous cows. The resulting equations from the statistical models predicted that reducing the DCAD from +200 to -100 mEq/kg would increase blood total Ca on the day of calving from 1.86 to 2.04 ± 0.05 mM, DMI postpartum 1.0 kg/d, and milk yield 1.7 kg/d in parous cows. The increased concentrations of blood total Ca at calving and postpartum explained the marked reduction in risk of milk fever in parous cows with a reduction in DCAD. As the DCAD decreased, the risk of retained placenta and metritis also decreased, resulting in fewer disease events per cow in both nulliparous and parous cows. Dietary concentrations of Ca, P, or Mg prepartum had no effect on DMI or yields of milk and FCM; however, increasing dietary Ca within the study range of 0.16 to 1.98\% of dry matter tended to increase the risk of milk fever in parous cows regardless of DCAD fed. Collectively, results support the recommendation of prepartum acidogenic diets to result in a negative DCAD to parous cows with improvements in lactation performance and reduced risk of diseases; however, the range of DCAD fed did not allow for detection of an optimum value for postpartum performance. On the other hand, despite improvements in blood concentrations of Ca and reduction in uterine diseases with a reduction in DCAD fed to nulliparous cows, productive performance was either depressed or unaffected and the limited number of experiments did not provide sufficient evidence for a recommended DCAD for this group of cows.},

OBJECTIVE: To evidence, in animal models, of how a high-fat diet influence the mechanisms involved in hypothalamic inflammation. DATA SOURCES: Scopus, PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Embase databases were searched. DATA EXTRACTION: The exclusion criteria were human studies, studies with medicinal products or other substances not related to food, paper reviews, studies that used a surgical intervention or an intervention with food to reverse hypothalamic inflammation, and studies with genetically modified animals. The identified studies were evaluated according to the following inclusion criteria: animal studies, studies in which a control group was included in the experimental design, and studies in which markers of inflammation in the hypothalamus were evaluated. DATA ANALYSIS: A total of 322 studies were found, of which 9 met the inclusion criteria for a systematic review, conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, and were included in this review. CONCLUSION: The exposure of rodents to high-fat diets promoted an increase in levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and other proteins involved in the inflammatory process in the hypothalamus.

	doi = {10.1186/s13071-019-3339-5},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The zoonotic parasite Taenia saginata utilizes bovines as an intermediate host (causing cysticercosis) and humans as the definitive host (causing taeniosis). The public health burden of T. saginata is assumed to be low, but the economic burden is large, due to the resources utilized in the detection and condemnation of infected carcasses and carcass parts. As part of a collaborative effort to synthesize worldwide epidemiological data on this parasite, we present here the results of a systematic review on the distribution of T. saginata taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). METHODS: Information on the occurrence and prevalence of T. saginata taeniosis and cysticercosis in the MENA region was obtained through a systematic review of published and grey literature, including OIE reports, published between January 1st, 1990 and December 31st, 2017. RESULTS: A total of 63 publications were retrieved across the 21 MENA countries. Taenia saginata taeniosis was reported in 11 of these countries, whereas unspecified taeniosis was reported for a further seven. Microscopy-based prevalence values ranged between 0.02-8.6\%. Bovine cysticercosis prevalence estimates based on meat inspection were only reported for Egypt and Israel, with prevalence data ranging between 0.2-20\% and 0.1-9.1\% for cattle and buffaloes, respectively. The presence of bovine cysticercosis could be confirmed for 10 additional countries through OIE reports. CONCLUSIONS: Human taeniosis occurrence was confirmed for 86\% (18/21) of the countries in the MENA region, although in several of these countries the species responsible was not specified. Religious prohibitions on the consumption of pork and the limited extent of pig farming across much of this region, however, suggest that many reported taeniosis cases are likely to be attributable to T. saginata rather than Taenia solium or Taenia asiatica. There was a paucity of data regarding both the prevalence and economic impact of bovine cysticercosis. More detailed epidemiological data on both T. saginata taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis could be obtained by adopting an integrated "One Health" approach, considering the characteristics (e.g. ecosystem related and sociopolitical aspects) of the MENA region. Compared with more conventional approaches, this could lead to an enhanced performance and cost-effectiveness of surveillance systems.},

	abstract = {This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to summarize the effects of maternal undernutrition or overnutrition during pregnancy on fetal weight and morphometric measurements during pregnancy, at birth, and postnatal period in sheep. After completing the search, selection, and data extraction steps, the measure of effect was generated by the individual comparison of each indicator with the average of the control and treated group (undernutrition or overnutrition) using the DerSimonian and Laird method for random effects. Subgroup analyses were also performed for lambing order, litter size, sex, as well as level, timing, and duration of the intervention. Fetal weight during the first third of pregnancy was not affected by maternal undernutrition or overnutrition. On the other hand, undernutrition in the second and last third of gestation reduces the weight of the lamb both during pregnancy, at birth, and during the postnatal period, requiring at least 120 postnatal days to achieve the same weight as its contemporaries in the control treatment. However, this reduction in weight is not accompanied by reductions in morphometric measurements, demonstrating that the animals were lighter, but of equal size. In overnutrition, there is an increase in fetal weight in the second third of gestation. However, in the last third of the gestational period, there are no differences in fetal weight for the multiparous subgroup, but it was reduced in primiparous ewes. There are no effects of overnutrition on birth weight; however, this result is highly heterogeneous. Thus, maternal nutrition of ewe during pregnancy has effects on fetal and postnatal weight, but not on size. Furthermore, the effects of undernutrition are more homogeneous while overnutrition showed heterogeneous responses.},

Peer-reviewed studies written in English from two databases, PubMed and Embase, were searched up to 28 February 2018. Studies reporting blood glucose levels in diabetic rodents with and without receiving rooibos extracts or their major phenolic compounds are included. Twelve studies enrolling 88 diabetic rodents treated with rooibos extracts or their polyphenols and 85 diabetic control males reported blood glucose levels. The pooled effect size was -0.89 (95\% CI: -1.44 to -0.35) with a substantial heterogeneity (I² = 67.0\%). This effect was likely to be modified by type of rooibos extracts and their polyphenols and treatment period.

	abstract = {Objective : The aim of the study was to perform a literature review to analyze the effect of photobiomodulation in experimental studies on peripheral nerve regeneration after sciatic nerve crush injury in rodents. Methods: A bibliographic search was performed in the electronic databases, including MEDLINE (PubMed), SCOPUS, and SciELO, from 2008 to 2018. Results: A total of 1912 articles were identified in the search, and only 19 fulfilled all the inclusion criteria. Along with the parameters most found in the manuscripts, the most used wavelengths were 660 nm and 830 nm, power of 30 and 40 mW, and energy density of 4 and 10 J/cm(2) . For total energy throughout the intervention period, the lowest energy found with positive effects was 0.70 J, and the highest 1.141 J. Seventeen studies reported positive effects on nerve regeneration. The variables selected to analyze the effect were: Sciatic Functional Index (SFI), Static Sciatic Index (SSI), morphometric, morphological, histological, zymographic, electrophysiological, resistance mechanics and range of motion (ROM). The variety of parameters used in the studies demonstrated that there is yet no pre-determined protocol for treating peripheral nerve regeneration. Only two studies by different authors used the same power, energy density, beam area, and power density. Conclusion: It was concluded that the therapeutic window of the photobiomodulation presents a high variability of parameters with the wavelength (632.8 to 940 nm), power (5 to 170 mW) and energy density (3 to 280 J /cm(2) ), promoting nerve regeneration through the expression of cytokines and growth factors that aid in modulating the inflammatory process, improving morphological aspects, restoring the functionality to the animals in a brief period.},

This review aimed at exploring the results of the behavioral tools and tests which have been used to evaluate cognitive dysfunction in different animal models of sepsis. Two independent investigators searched for sepsis- and cognition-related keywords. 6323 publications were found, of which 355 were selected based on their title, and 226 of these were chosen based on manuscript review. LPS was used to induce sepsis in 171 studies, while CLP was used in 55 studies. Inhibitory avoidance was the most widely used method for assessing aversive memory, followed by fear conditioning and continuous multi-trial inhibitory avoidance. With regard to non-aversive memory, most studies used the water maze, open-field, object recognition, Y-maze, plus maze, and radial maze tests. Both CLP and LPS models of sepsis were effective in inducing short- and long-term behavioral impairment. Our findings help elucidate the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of sepsis-induced cognitive changes, as well as the available methods and tests used to study this in animal models.},

	abstract = {Mycoplasma gallisepticum is one of the most important poultry pathogens that can also infect wild birds, but knowledge of potential non-poultry hosts that could be reservoirs of M. gallisepticum is limited. For the paper presented here, we screened three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and the Web of Knowledge) to find articles on the occurrence of M. gallisepticum in different wild bird species that were published between 1951 and 2018. Among 314 studies found, we selected and included 50 original articles that met the pre-established criteria. From those publications we extracted the following information: name of the first author, year of publication, year of sample isolation, country, region, number of birds sampled, number of birds tested by each method, number of positive samples, diagnostic criteria, and if birds were wild or captive. Because different detection techniques were used to confirm the presence of M. gallisepticum in one animal, we decided to perform the meta analyses separately for each method. The estimated prevalence of M. gallisepticum in wild birds was different by each method of detection. Our summary revealed that M. gallisepticum was present in 56 species of bird belonging to 11 different orders, of which 21 species were reported suffering both past and current infection. Our work provides information on wild bird species that could be considered potential reservoirs or carriers of M. gallisepticum and could be helpful to set the direction for future research on the spread and phylogeny of M. gallisepticum in different hosts.},

The aim of this study was to present a systematic review of literature on the prognostic significance of morphotypes in canine lymphomas. Standardized Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria were applied. Retrospective and prospective studies were included. Level of evidence was determined for each study. Some acceptable evidence suggested a significant prognostic impact of morphotypes in canine lymphomas. However, the evidence is not sufficiently robust to determine with precision the most appropriate classification scheme. Updated Kiel and World Health Organization (WHO) classifications seem to remain the most appropriate classification systems with regards to the number of available studies and their levels of evidence. Limitations included lack of randomized control trial, and relative lack of prospective studies available. Current recommended classification of canine lymphoma is the systematic determination of morphotype in each new case. The Updated Kiel and the WHO classifications adapted to dog both remain the schemes with the most valuable interest. Prospective studies in larger population, and international consensus to define precisely each morphotype, are warranted, with application of standardized staging method and treatment.},

	abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Large cardiovascular outcome trials demonstrated that the cardioprotective effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors might reach beyond glucose-lowering action. In this meta-analysis, we sought to evaluate the potential infarct size-modulating effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in preclinical studies. METHODS: In this preregistered meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42020189124), we included placebo-controlled, interventional studies of small and large animal models of myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury, testing the effect of SGLT2 inhibitor treatment on myocardial infarct size (percentage of area at risk or total area). Standardised mean differences (SMDs) were calculated and pooled using random-effects method. We evaluated heterogeneity by computing Τ(2) and I(2) values. Meta-regression was performed to explore prespecified subgroup differences according to experimental protocols and their contribution to heterogeneity was assessed (pseudo-R(2) values). RESULTS: We identified ten eligible publications, reporting 16 independent controlled comparisons on a total of 224 animals. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitor significantly reduced myocardial infarct size compared with placebo (SMD = -1.30 [95\% CI -1.79, -0.81], p {\textless} 0.00001), referring to a 33\% [95\% CI 20\%, 47\%] difference. Heterogeneity was moderate (Τ(2) = 0.58, I(2) = 60\%). SGLT2 inhibitors were only effective when administered to the intact organ system, but not to isolated hearts (p interaction {\textless}0.001, adjusted pseudo-R(2) = 47\%). While acute administration significantly reduced infarct size, chronic treatment was superior (p interaction {\textless}0.001, adjusted pseudo-R(2) = 85\%). The medications significantly reduced infarct size in both diabetic and non-diabetic animals, favouring the former (p interaction = 0.030, adjusted pseudo-R(2) = 12\%). Treatment was equally effective in rats and mice, as well as in a porcine model. Individual study quality scores were not related to effect estimates (p = 0.33). The overall effect estimate remained large even after adjusting for severe forms of publication bias. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The glucose-lowering SGLT2 inhibitors reduce myocardial infarct size in animal models independent of diabetes. Future in vivo studies should focus on clinical translation by exploring whether SGLT2 inhibitors limit infarct size in animals with relevant comorbidities, on top of loading doses of antiplatelet agents. Mechanistic studies should elucidate the potential relationship between the infarct size-lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors and the intact organ system.},

Success of a drug design is dependent on correct biological evaluation. Concerning new drug designs for Chagas disease, it is essential to first identify the most effective, existing, experimental chronic protocols that can be used for comparison purposes. Here, we present a literature review regarding experimental models with chronic Chagas disease to evaluate the efficacy of benznidazole (BZN). We searched literature published in PubMed and Web of Science databases, using these keywords: animal model, BZN, Chagas disease, T. cruzi, and chronic phase, with no timeframe limitations. We excluded articles involving acute phase animal models and/or those without BZN treatment. The selected studies were conducted using different BZN concentrations (10mg-100mg) involving several different periods (5-70 days). Concentrations and durations of use are directly related to side effects, but do not prevent chronic tissue lesions. BZN use during the late/chronic phases of Chagas disease is unable to eliminate amastigote forms present in infected tissues. This study suggests the administration of a lower BZN concentration ({\textless}100mg/kg/day) during the chronic phase of the animal model, as this had been reported to result in fewer side effects.},

These three features are evaluated using scoring systems similar to those classically used to assess pain, i.e. simple descriptive scales, numerical rating scales (NRS), visual analogue scales and/or multifactorial sedation scales. In addition, head height above the ground is often used as a measure of the depth of sedation. Very few authors have described how to adjust the administration rate or dose of alpha-2 agonists. Based on the available literature, the Ghent Sedation Algorithm was developed, which assigns scores (NRS) for degree of ataxia, sedation depth and surgical conditions, and uses these to prescribe changes in the administration rate of constant rate infusions of alpha-2 agonists.

DESIGN: Medline via PubMed, EMBASE and Open Grey databases were searched for published and unpublished literature. Search terms included "mandiblular condyle", "alveolar bone", "temporomandibular joint", "condylar cartilage", "periodontal ligament", "rat", "mice". After data extraction, risk of bias (SYRCLE) and reporting quality (ARRIVE) were assessed. Random effects meta-analyses were performed for the outcomes of interest where applicable. RESULTS: A total of 33 relevant articles were considered in the systematic review, while only 6 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. Risk of Bias in all studies was judged to be unclear to high overall, while reporting quality was suboptimal. Comparing soft to hard diet animals, significantly reduced anteroposterior condylar length (4 studies, weighted mean difference: -0.40 mm; 95\% CI: -0.47, -0.32; p {\textless} 0.001) and width (4 studies, weighted mean difference: -0.043 mm; 95\% CI: -0.51, -0.36; p {\textless} 0.001) were found in rats. Decreased anteroposterior condylar dimensions were detected for mice as well (2 studies, weighted mean difference: -0.049; 95\% CI: -0.56, -0.43; p {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there was strong evidence to suggest a significant effect of soft diet on reduced condylar dimensions in rodents; however, there is need for further high quality experimental studies to inform current knowledge on condylar cartilage, alveolar bone and periodontal ligament related outcomes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence for the conservative and surgical management of pericardial effusions for neoplastic and idiopathic etiologies in dogs. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. SAMPLE POPULATION: Peer-reviewed English-language articles describing the treatment and outcome of naturally occurring pericardial effusion in domestic dogs. METHODS: A literature search was performed with PubMed, Cab Abstracts, Scopus, and Agricola in August 2019 for articles describing pericardial effusion treatment in dogs. Inclusion criteria were applied, and articles were evaluated for reported outcome and level of evidence by using The Oxford 2011 Levels of Evidence, a previously described hierarchical system, and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation). RESULTS: One hundred eight of the 641 unique articles that were identified and evaluated met inclusion criteria. Most articles included were case studies (68.2\%) or retrospective case series (25.2\%), with all articles providing a low level of evidence. The articles had inconsistent inclusion criteria, outcome measures, and follow-up, making comparison of outcomes difficult. CONCLUSION: Because of the low quality of evidence of the studies included in this systematic review and the variability of the outcomes, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend one treatment option rather than another. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: There is a requirement for higher quality evidence such as randomized controlled trials and prospective comparative cohort studies. Standardization of outcome measures reported for each treatment option and disease process studied will allow for better comparison of outcomes between studies.},

	abstract = {Rats and mice are widely used to study environmental effects on psychological and metabolic health. Study designs differ widely and are often characterized by varying (social) housing conditions. In itself, housing has a profound influence on physiology and behaviour of rodents, affecting energy balance and sustainable metabolic health. However, evidence for potential long-term consequences of individual versus social housing on body weight and metabolic phenotype is inconsistent. We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analyses assessing effects of individual versus social housing of rats and mice, living under well-accepted laboratory conditions, on measures of metabolic health, including body weight, food intake and visceral adipose tissue mass. Seventy-one studies were included in this review; 59 were included in the meta-analysis. Whilst housing did not affect body weight, both food intake and visceral adipose tissue mass were significantly higher in individually compared with socially housed animals. A combination of emotional stress and lack of social thermoregulation likely contributed to these effects. Increased awareness of consequences and improved specifications of housing conditions are necessary to accurately evaluate efficacy of drugs, diets or other interventions on metabolic and other health outcomes because housing conditions are rarely considered as possible moderators of reported outcomes.},

	abstract = {Biochar, that is, carbonized biomass similar to charcoal, has been used in acute medical treatment of animals for many centuries. Since 2010, livestock farmers increasingly use biochar as a regular feed supplement to improve animal health, increase nutrient intake efficiency and thus productivity. As biochar gets enriched with nitrogen-rich organic compounds during the digestion process, the excreted biochar-manure becomes a more valuable organic fertilizer causing lower nutrient losses and greenhouse gas emissions during storage and soil application. Scientists only recently started to investigate the mechanisms of biochar in the different stages of animal digestion and thus most published results on biochar feeding are based so far on empirical studies. This review summarizes the state of knowledge up to the year 2019 by evaluating 112 relevant scientific publications on the topic to derive initial insights, discuss potential mechanisms behind observations and identify important knowledge gaps and future research needs. The literature analysis shows that in most studies and for all investigated farm animal species, positive effects on different parameters such as toxin adsorption, digestion, blood values, feed efficiency, meat quality and/or greenhouse gas emissions could be found when biochar was added to feed. A considerable number of studies provided statistically non-significant results, though tendencies were mostly positive. Rare negative effects were identified in regard to the immobilization of liposoluble feed ingredients (e.g., vitamin E or Carotenoids) which may limit long-term biochar feeding. We found that most of the studies did not systematically investigate biochar properties (which may vastly differ) and dosage, which is a major drawback for generalizing results. Our review demonstrates that the use of biochar as a feed additive has the potential to improve animal health, feed efficiency and livestock housing climate, to reduce nutrient losses and greenhouse gas emissions, and to increase the soil organic matter content and thus soil fertility when eventually applied to soil. In combination with other good practices, co-feeding of biochar may thus have the potential to improve the sustainability of animal husbandry. However, more systematic multi-disciplinary research is definitely needed to arrive at generalizable recommendations.},

The overall methodological quality of the publications was considered low, low to moderate, moderate, moderate to high and high in ten, four, twelve, five and a further four, respectively. We assessed the treatment and possible toxicity of MOX in 13 mammalian species, six investigations reported adverse effects to MOX in a small percentage of individuals. The authors reported observed reactions that were typically mild symptoms that did not require additional therapies, and/or resolved themselves.

	abstract = {Echinococcus multilocularis is a zoonotic cestode of canid definitive hosts that is emerging as a parasite of medical and veterinary concern in regions of North America, Europe and Asia. Infection with the metacestode stage (alveolar echinococcosis - AE) is life-threatening, especially for patients who reside in low resource countries and lack access to modern diagnostic tests and treatments. The overall objectives of this One Health review were to systematically describe the diagnostic tests currently employed in endemic countries to detect E. multilocularis in people, canids and the environment, and to report the test characteristics of new diagnostic techniques for population surveillance. In this systematic review of English and Chinese language databases, we identified 92 primary records of E. multilocularis surveillance in canids (N = 75), humans (N = 20) and/or the environment (food, soil; N = 3) and 12 grey literature records that reported E. multilocularis surveillance or health systems protocols between 2008 and 2018. Surveillance for E. multilocularis was conducted using a broad range of combined morphological, molecular, immunological and imaging techniques. Nine studies reporting diagnostic evaluations for cestode or metacestode detection were identified, including studies on copro-antigen ELISA, copro-PCR, intestinal examination, Western Blot, magnetic capture RT-PCR and immunochromatography. Our dataset includes prevalence estimates for E. multilocularis in canids, people, or environment in 27 of the 43 endemic countries and reports data gaps in surveillance, laboratory methods, and diagnostic sensitivity. International consensus on gold standard diagnostic techniques and harmonization of human, canid and environmental surveillance data across political boundaries are needed to comprehensively assess the global burden and distribution of this parasite.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Large quantities of antimicrobials are given to food animals, particularly in feed, potentially increasing antimicrobial resistance in humans. However, the magnitude of this effect is unclear. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and Web of Science for studies on interventions that limited antimicrobial use in food animals, in any setting and context, to reduce antimicrobial resistance 1) in those food animals; and 2) in humans. We validated our strategy by testing whether it identified known relevant studies. Data from included studies were extracted into pre-designed and pilot-tested forms. RESULTS: We included 104 articles containing 93 studies. Heterogeneity (different animal species, environs, antimicrobial classes, interventions, administration routes, sampling, and methods), was considerable, precluding meta-analysis. The evidence was therefore synthesised narratively. A total of 89 studies (3 directly, 86 indirectly) addressed whether limiting antimicrobial exposure in food animals led to decreased antimicrobial resistance in those animals. The evidence was adequate to conclude this, although the magnitude of the effect could not be quantified. Four studies (1 directly, 3 indirectly) examined whether withdrawal of antibiotics changed resistance of potential pathogens in retail food for human consumption, and in bacteria of humans themselves. The direct (observational) study of broiler hatchery in ovo antimicrobial injection found a credible effect in terms of size reduction and time sequences. INTERPRETATION: Limiting antimicrobial use in food animals reduces antimicrobial resistance in food animals, and probably reduces antimicrobial resistance in humans. The magnitude of the effect cannot be quantified.},

Unfortunately, the terms used for the different dimensions of hoof structures differ widely. We conducted a systematic literature review with the aim of collecting terms used for hoof measurements, and to analyze the findings. Our body of literature consisted of papers and recommended reference books, written in both English and in German over the past 10 years. More than 600 scientific papers were found using the search string "TITLE-ABS-KEY ((equine OR horse) AND hoof) AND PUBYEAR {\textgreater} 2009 AND (LIMIT-TO (SUBJAREA, 'VETE"))" in Scopus'. Additionally, 5 handbooks were taken into account. A total of 80 Distances, 24 Angles, 34 Ratios and 16 Other measures (e.g. area of sole surface, mediolateral hoof balance) were identified. The highest number of entries (49) was recorded for the caudal angle between Pars dorsalis of the hoof and the ground line, termed often as hoof angle, dorsal hoof wall angle, or toe angle (10 English/2 German terms in total). The length of the Facies solearis, Distance between the outer extent of Pars dorsalis and dorsal cortex of Phalanx distalis; and the caudal angle between Margo solearis of Phalanx distalis and the ground line were classified as measures with highly inconsistent nomenclature (terms/entries of measure 16/25, 17/28 and 17/30, respectively). The most consistent nomenclature was recorded for the term Heel length (12/12). One should be aware of the fact that different terms might be used for the same item or that the same term might signify different measures in different publications. Established terms are not always anatomically correct. We recommend defining every used term in detail, in both written form using correct anatomical nomenclature, and in a figure. The same terms should be used in all publications of one working group. Suggestions for consistent terminology of 15 commonly used measurements in English and German are provided in the paper.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditionally, wide lateral surgical margins of 3 cm and one fascial plane deep have been recommended for resection of canine cutaneous mast cell tumor (MCT). Several studies have been published assessing surgical margins of less than this traditional recommendation. The objective of this systematic review was to determine if resection MCT with lateral surgical margins {\textless} 3 cm results in low rates of incomplete resection and local tumor recurrence. Systematic searches of digital bibliographic databases were performed with two authors (AR \& LES) screening abstracts to identify relevant scientific articles. Studies regarding surgical treatment of dogs with cutaneous MCT were reviewed. Data abstraction was performed and the quality of individual studies and the strength of the body of evidence for utilization of surgical margins {\textless} 3 cm for removal of MCTs was assessed. RESULTS: From the initial 78 citations identified through the database searches, four articles were retained for data abstraction after both relevance screenings were performed. Two studies were retrospective observational studies, one was a prospective case series and one was a prospective clinical trial. Assessment of the quality level of the body of evidence identified using the GRADE system was low. Excision of MCT at 2 cm and 3 cm was associated with comparably low rates of incomplete excision and recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the low quality of the overall body of evidence, a recommendation can be made that resection of canine cutaneous MCTs ({\textless} 4 cm) of Patnaik grade I and II with 2 cm lateral margins and 1 fascial plane deep results in low rates of incomplete excision and local tumor recurrence.},

HW infections composed 2\%-100\% of cases in EVD and 5\%-50\% of cases in MVD outbreaks. Among exposed HWs, 0.6\%-92\% developed EVD, and 1\%-10\% developed MVD. HW infection rates were consistent through outbreaks. The most common exposure risk situations were inadequate personal protective equipment and exposure to patients with unrecognized EVD/MVD. Similar risks were reported in past EVD/MVD outbreaks and in the recent outbreak in West Africa. CONCLUSIONS: Many outbreaks reported high proportions of infected HWs. Similar HW infection rates and exposure risk factors in both past and recent EVD and MVD outbreaks emphasize the need to improve the implementation of appropriate infection control measures consistently across all healthcare settings.},

This review aimed at assessing the ESBL-PE clones circulating in humans, animals and the environment to provide evidence-based insights for combating ESBL-PE using One Health approach. Systematic search from Medline/PubMed, Google Scholar and African Journals Online was carried out and retrieved nine eligible articles (of 131) based on phenotypic and genotypic detection of ESBL-PE between 2005 and 2016 in Tanzania. Analysis was performed using STATA 11.0 software to delineate the prevalence of ESBL-PE, phenotypic resistance profiles and clones circulating in the three interfaces. The overall prevalence of ESBL-PE in the three interfaces was 22.6\% (95\% CI: 21.1-24.2) with the predominance of Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains (51.6\%). The majority of ESBL-PE were resistant to the commonly used antimicrobials such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline/doxycycline, 38\%-55\% were resistant to ciprofloxacin and all were sensitive to meropenem/imipenem. ESBL-PE infections were more associated with deaths compared to non-ESBL-PE infections. Strikingly, E. coli ST38, ST131 and ST2852 were found to intersect variably across the three interfaces. The predominant allele, bla(CTX-M-15,) was found mostly in the conjugative IncF plasmids connoting transmission potential. The high prevalence of ESBL-PE and shared clones across the three interfaces, including the global E. coli ST131 clone, indicates wide and inter-compartmental spread that calls for One Health genomic-driven studies to track the resistome flow.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite the mechanical and biological roles of subchondral bone (SCB) in articular cartilage health, there remains no consensus on the postoperative morphological status of SCB following bone marrow stimulation (BMS). The purpose of this systematic review was to clarify the morphology of SCB following BMS in preclinical, translational animal models. DESIGN: The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were systematically reviewed using specific search terms on April 19, 2016 based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The morphology of the SCB was assessed using of microcomputed tomography (bone density) and histology (microscopic architecture). RESULTS: Seventeen animal studies with 520 chondral lesions were included. The morphology of SCB did not recover following BMS. Compared with untreated chondral defects, BMS resulted in superior morphology of superficial SCB and cartilage but inferior morphology (specifically bone density, P {\textless} 0.05) of the deep SCB. Overall, the use of biological adjuvants during BMS resulted in the superior postoperative morphology of SCB. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in the SCB following BMS were confirmed. Biologics adjuvants may improve the postoperative morphology of both SCB and articular cartilage. Refinements of BMS techniques should incorporate consideration of SCB damage and restoration. Investigations to optimize BMS techniques incorporating both minimally invasive approaches and biologically augmented platforms are further warranted.},

	abstract = {Unicellular eukaryotes of the Trypanosomatidae family include human and animal pathogens that belong to the Trypanosoma and Leishmania genera. Diagnosis of the diseases they cause requires the sampling of body fluids (e.g., blood, lymph, peritoneal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid) or organ biopsies (e.g., bone marrow, spleen), which are mostly obtained through invasive methods. Body fluids or appendages can be alternatives to these invasive biopsies but appropriateness remains poorly studied. To further address this question, we perform a systematic review on clues evidencing the presence of parasites, genetic material, antibodies, and antigens in body secretions, appendages, or the organs or proximal tissues that produce these materials. Paper selection was based on searches in PubMed, Web of Science, WorldWideScience, SciELO, Embase, and Google. The information of each selected article (n = 333) was classified into different sections and data were extracted from 77 papers. The presence of Trypanosomatidae parasites has been tracked in most of organs or proximal tissues that produce body secretions or appendages, in naturally or experimentally infected hosts. The meta-analysis highlights the paucity of studies on human African trypanosomiasis and an absence on animal trypanosomiasis. Among the collected data high heterogeneity in terms of the I(2) statistic (100\%) is recorded. A high positivity is recorded for antibody and genetic material detection in urine of patients and dogs suffering leishmaniasis, and of antigens for leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. Data on conjunctival swabs can be analyzed with molecular methods solely for dogs suffering canine visceral leishmaniasis. Saliva and hair/bristles showed a pretty good positivity that support their potential to be used for leishmaniasis diagnosis. In conclusion, our study pinpoints significant gaps that need to be filled in order to properly address the interest of body secretion and hair or bristles for the diagnosis of infections caused by Leishmania and by other Trypanosomatidae parasites.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several options have been proposed for the treatment of congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunts (cEHPSS) in dogs, but formal comparisons among different treatment options are currently unavailable. A previous evidence-based review (2012) found low quality of evidence for papers assessing the treatment of cEHPSS in dogs. OBJECTIVES: To assess the quality of evidence available in the treatment of cEHPSS, summarize the current state of knowledge with respect to outcome after cEHPSS management, and compare different treatment techniques. ANIMALS: Not used. METHODS: A bibliographic search was performed without date or language restrictions. Studies were assessed for quality of evidence (study design, study group sizes, subject enrollment quality, and overall risk of bias) and outcome measures reported (perioperative outcome, clinical outcome, and surgical or interventional outcome), all reported with 95\% confidence intervals. A network meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: Forty-eight studies were included. Six retrospective studies (grade 4b) compared 2 techniques and 7 were abstracts (grade 5). The quality of evidence was low and risk of bias high. Regarding surgical outcome, statistically significant superiority of ameroid constrictor over thin film band was observed (P = .003). No other comparisons were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The evidence base of choice of treatment of cEHPSS in dogs remains weak despite recent publications on the subject. Ameroid is superior to thin film band in causing EHPSS closure. Blinded randomized studies comparing different treatment modalities, which routinely include postoperative imaging to assess cEHPSS closure and acquired portosystemic shunt development are essential.},

	abstract = {Blastocystosis is an interesting parasitosis, since the parasitic infection is still seriously neglected and a considerable zoonotic evidence is emerging. Blastocystis sp. infects the intestinal lumen of humans and a wide range of animals, while there is a lack of comprehensive information on Blastocystis epidemiology in cattle worldwide. Thus, the present systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by exploring four electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google scholar) for relevant published papers up to 7th November 2020, utilizing a random-effects model to pool estimations and assign 95 \% confidence intervals (CIs). Results of 28 studies (29 datasets) on cattle showed a 24.4 \% (95 \% CI: 16.9-33.9 \%) prevalence for Blastocystis infection. Also, 16 out of 26 reported subtypes (STs) were isolated from cattle, with ST10 (18 datasets) as the highest-reported [32.3 \% (95 \% CI: 21.6-45.3)] as well as ST24 and ST25 (one study each) as the lowest-reported STs [1.4 \% (95 \% CI: 0.2-9.1)]. Additionally, among nine well-known zoonotic STs (ST1-ST8 and ST12), all STs except for ST8 were reported from cattle worldwide, demonstrating this animal species as a potential reservoir for human infections. Meanwhile, the overall prevalence of Blastocystis in various subgroups (publication year, WHO regions, countries, continents, and age groups) was analyzed separately. The finding of the present review article highlights the cattle as a significant source of zoonotic transmission of Blastocystis infection to humans, which must be considered for preventive measures.},

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the effects of animal versus plant protein intake on bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC) and select bone biomarkers in healthy adults. METHODS: Searches across five databases were conducted through 10/31/16 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies in healthy adults that examined the effects of animal versus plant protein intake on 1) total body (TB), total hip (TH), lumbar spine (LS) or femoral neck (FN) BMD or TB BMC for at least one year, or 2) select bone formation and resorption biomarkers for at least six months. Strength of evidence (SOE) was assessed and random effect meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: Seven RCTs examining animal vs. isoflavone-rich soy (Soy+) protein intake in 633 healthy peri-menopausal (n = 1) and post-menopausal (n = 6) women were included. Overall risk of bias was medium. Limited SOE suggests no significant difference between Soy+ vs. animal protein on LS, TH, FN and TB BMD, TB BMC, and bone turnover markers BSAP and NTX. Meta-analysis results showed on average, the differences between Soy+ and animal protein groups were close to zero and not significant for BMD outcomes (LS: n = 4, pooled net \% change: 0.24\%, 95\% CI: -0.80\%, 1.28\%; TB: n = 3, -0.24\%, 95\% CI: -0.81\%, 0.33\%; FN: n = 3, 0.13\%, 95\% CI: -0.94\%, 1.21\%). All meta-analyses had no statistical heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support soy protein consumption as more advantageous than animal protein, or vice versa.

The aim of this systematic review was to examine the relation between ASF consumption and stunting in children aged 6-60 mo in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The secondary aim was to examine the relation between ASF consumption and other indicators of growth and development (length/height, weight, head circumference, and anemia). A search of the peer-reviewed and grey literature published from January 1980 to June 2017 was conducted. Databases searched included CINAHL, Embase, Global Index Medicus, PubMed, and Web of Science. There were 14,783 records and 116 full text articles dual screened; 21 studies were included in the review and were dual evaluated for risk of bias (RoB). The relation between ASF and stunting (length- or height-for-age z-score←2) was examined in randomized-controlled trials [(RCTs), n = 3] and cross-sectional studies (n = 4) only; ASF reduced stunting in 1 RCT and was associated with reduced stunting in 1 cross-sectional study. We did not identify any longitudinal cohorts that examined this relation. The relation between ASF and secondary indicators length/height, weight, head circumference, and anemia were largely nonsignificant across study designs. The intervention/exposure, comparator, outcome measures, methods, and analyses were highly heterogeneous. Although we did not find a consistent relation between ASF consumption and our primary and secondary outcomes, this may have been a function of inconsistencies in study design. Foods in the whole diet, particularly combination dishes, are inherently difficult to assess. To quantitatively assess the relation between ASF and stunting and other indicators of growth and iron status in early childhood, future research should provide consistency in the definition and quantification of the exposure and outcomes allowing for interstudy quantitative comparisons.},

Objective • The research team intended to determine the current state of research examining the effects of various probiotic strains on lipid profiles, including measures in serum of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Design • The review examined studies, in both animal and human models and focused on the potential of various probiotic strains to be dietary adjuncts in lowering levels of serum cholesterol with the aim of reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CHD. Articles were reviewed systematically from Web search bases including PubMed and Cochrane Clinical Trial Registry. Articles meeting the inclusion search criteria were selected for further review and analysis. Only randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of probiotics on lipid profiles in animals or humans were considered for inclusion in the review. Setting • The selection of articles and further inclusion in the review was performed in Institute of Home Economics, University of Delhi (New Delhi, India). Results • Some of the studies, in both animal and human models, have revealed that several strains were able to improve at least 1 lipid fraction. Although the results from animal studies have been fairly consistent, the findings from studies on humans have varied. Some strains when evaluated in human studies have shown insignificant effects on lipid fractions. Conclusions • Although several mechanisms for cholesterol removal by probiotics have been proposed, they need further investigation to be validated.},

	abstract = {Infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK) is a common ocular disease in cattle that causes economic losses to producers and negatively impacts animal welfare. In a 2016 survey of cow-calf producers in California, IBK was identified as the disease for which antimicrobials are most frequently used. The presented scoping review examined the available literature for methods to prevent IBK and for alternatives to antimicrobials to treat the disease that can be applied in cow-calf operations. Online databases were searched for publications about IBK in cattle populations that were reported from 1950 to 2020. Citations were systematically evaluated in a multi-stage approach using commercial software and summarized in a scoping review format. For the studies included in the review, most research (n = 50) has focused on the development of vaccines for the prevention of IBK. Although the quality of publications has improved over time, there is a lack of consistent evidence for vaccine efficacy against IBK in post-2000 experimental and conventional vaccine trials. A systematic analysis of vaccine studies is warranted. A limited number (n = 6) of studies evaluated the prevention of IBK through fly control, where most have found efficacy of this control measure. Several treatment options (n = 5) that do not include the use of antimicrobials have been investigated but remain at the preliminary stage of testing. Differences in breed susceptibility has been demonstrated with breeds belonging to the Bos indicus subspecies less frequently affected compared to those belonging to the Bos taurus subspecies. Hereford cattle and those lacking pigmentation around the eyelid margin are more frequently affected than other breeds. At present, there are few evidence-based measures that producers can utilize to reduce the burden of IBK in their herds and more research into the efficacy of fly control measures, non-antimicrobial treatment options, the continued search for a viable vaccine, as well as identifying genetic markers associated with traits that confer resistance to the disease are needed.},

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of literature on p38 MAPK expression, activation, and function in reproductive tissues throughout pregnancy and parturition, published between January 1980 and August 2017, using four electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Medline, and CoCHRANE). We identified 418 reports; 108 were selected for full-text evaluation and 74 were included in final review. p38 MAPK was investigated using feto-maternal primary or immortalized cells, tissue explants, and animal models. Western blot was most commonly used to report phosphorylated (active) p38 MAPK. Human placenta (27), chorioamniotic membranes (14), myometrium (13), decidua (8), and cervix (1) were the studied tissues. p38 MAPK's functions were tissue and gestational age dependent. Isoform specificity was hardly reported. p38 MAPK activity was induced by ROS or proinflammatory cytokines to promote cell signaling linked to cell fate, primed uterus, ripened cervix, and proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine production. In 35 years, reports on p38 MAPK's role during pregnancy and parturition are scarce and current literature is insufficient to provide a comprehensive description of p38 MAPK's mechanistic role during pregnancy and parturition.},

The methodological quality of the included RCTs were evaluated using Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and a meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: Seven studies were included in the review, and four studies were included in the meta-analysis. Comparing BVA plus conventional therapy (CT) with saline injection plus CT, it showed an effect in favor of BVA plus CT in visual analog scale (VAS) and pain rating scale (PRS) (p = 0.02, p = 0.009, respectively). Comparing BVA plus physiotherapy (PT) with saline injection plus PT, it showed that there was no significant difference in VAS and verbal rating scale (VRS) between the two groups. CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that BVA could be beneficial as an adjuvant treatment for shoulder pain.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAI) are effective treatments for a variety of psychological problems, the mechanism of treatment effectiveness remains unclear. Qualitative studies of AAI may reveal possible mechanisms. This review aims to synthesize qualitative research and identify factors that might contribute to the effectiveness of AAI. METHODS: A literature search of qualitative evidence published before August 8(th), 2018 was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, ERIC, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, and HABRI, with the aim of identifying qualitative research conducted with individuals undergoing AAI. Quality assessment was undertaken by CASP and the certainty of the evidence was evaluated using CERQual. RESULTS: A total of 1866 articles were reviewed, and seven were included in the final analysis. A total of six themes were identified as factors relating to the effectiveness of AAI: 1. Fostering feelings of normalcy, 2. Improving behavioral activation, 3. Self-esteem enhancement, 4. Physical contact, belonging, and companionship, 5. Calming and comforting, and 6. Distraction. Barriers to AAI effectiveness were also identified. CONCLUSION: The results of these studies suggest that AAI was viewed as a positive and highly accepted intervention across populations and settings. AAI might be a useful intervention among people who suffer from a variety of mental disorders. All themes consistently demonstrated that contact with a live animal is more important than the appearance of the animal. Additional investigations of AAI treatment mechanisms are needed.},

In this study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of Chlamydia infection in swine in China. From PubMed, ScienceDirect, Chinese Web of knowledge (CNKI), VIP Chinese journal database, and Wanfang database, we collected a total of 72 publications reported in 1985-2020. The prevalence of Chlamydia was 22.48\% in China. In the sampling year subgroup, the prevalence after 2011 was the highest (26.14\%). In southern China, the prevalence was 30.97\%. By contrast, the prevalence in northern China was only 10.79\%. Also the difference was significant (p {\textless} 0.05). In the provincial level, Hubei had the highest rate of 36.23\%. Boars had a higher prevalence (29.47\%). The prevalence of Chlamydia detection in pigs with reproductive disorders (21.86\%) was higher than that without reproductive disorders. Among the three age groups, finishing pigs (21.43\%) had the highest prevalence. The prevalence in large-scale farmed pigs (28.58\%) was the highest in the subgroup of feeding methods. The prevalence in farms was 24.29\%, which was the highest in the survey areas. The prevalence in spring was the highest with 40.51\%. Other methods had the highest prevalence (39.61\%) than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect hemagglutination assay. The prevalence of Chlamydia psittaci 18.41\% was lower than the prevalence of Chlamydia abortus (41.35\%). We also analyzed the impact of different climate factor subgroups (rainfall, temperature, and humidity) on the probability of pigs suffering from the disease. The results showed that Chlamydia was widespread in pigs in China. We suggest that we should strengthen the detection of Chlamydia in the semen of breeding pigs and pigs with reproductive disorders, and reasonably control the environment of large-scale pig farms, so as to reduce further infection of Chlamydia in pigs.},

Background: While there have been meta-analysis that surveyed the efficacy of minocycline in the treatment of acute stroke, they have some methodological limitations. We performed a new systematic review which was distinct from previous one by adding new outcomes and including new studies. Methods: Document retrieval was executed through PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Stroke Center, NIH's Clinical Trials, Current Controlled Trials, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal before Jan 2018. The data meeting the inclusion criteria were extracted. Before meta-analysis, publication bias and heterogeneity of included studies were surveyed. Random and fixed-effects models were employed to calculate pooled estimates and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Additionally, sensitivity and subgroup analyses were implemented. Result: For clinical studies, 4 trials with 201 patients in the minocycline group, and 195 patients in the control group met the inclusion criteria; 3 were randomized trials. At the end of 90-day follow up or discharge day, results showed that the groups receiving minocycline were superior to the control group, with significant differences in the NIHSS scores (mean difference [MD], -2.75; 95\% CI, -4.78, 0.27; p = 0.03) and mRS scores (MD, -0.98; 95\% CI, -1.27, -0.69; p {\textless} 0.01), but not Barthel Index Score (MD, 9.04; 95\% CI, -0.78, 18.07; p = 0.07). For rodent experiments, 14 studies were included. Neurological severity scores (NSS) was significantly improved (MD, -1.38; 95\% CI, -1.64, -1.31; p {\textless} 0.01) and infarct volume was obviously reduced (Std mean difference [SMD], -2.38; 95\% CI, -3.40, -1.36; p {\textless} 0.01) in the minocycline group. Heterogeneity among the studies was proved to exist for infarct volume (Chi(2) = 116.12, p {\textless} 0.01; I(2) = 0.89) but not for other variables.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Earlier studies suggest that probiotics have protective effects in the prevention of respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Whether such benefits apply to RTIs of viral origin and mechanisms supporting the effect remain unclear. AIM: To determine the role of gut microbiota modulation on clinical and laboratory outcomes of viral RTIs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of articles published in Embase and MEDLINE through 20 April 2020 to identify studies reporting the effect of gut microbiota modulation on viral RTIs in clinical studies and animal models. The incidence of viral RTIs, clinical manifestations, viral load and immunological outcomes was evaluated. RESULTS: We included 58 studies (9 randomized controlled trials; 49 animal studies). Six of eight clinical trials consisting of 726 patients showed that probiotics administration was associated with a reduced risk of viral RTIs. Most commonly used probiotics were Lactobacillus followed by Bifidobacterium and Lactococcus. In animal models, treatment with probiotics before viral challenge had beneficial effects against influenza virus infection by improving infection-induced survival (20/22 studies), mitigating symptoms (21/21 studies) and decreasing viral load (23/25 studies). Probiotics and commensal gut microbiota exerted their beneficial effects through strengthening host immunity. CONCLUSION: Modulation of gut microbiota represents a promising approach against viral RTIs via host innate and adaptive immunity regulation. Further research should focus on next generation probiotics specific to viral types in prevention and treatment of emerging viral RTIs.},

	abstract = {Cholestasis is an important cause of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Yinchenhao decoction has been used as a well-known traditional Chinese medicine used in the treatment of cholestasis for over 2,000 years. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the preclinical evidence of Yinchenhao decoction on cholestasis models. The following databases were searched from inception to February 2020. Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP medicine information system, Wanfang Database, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched. The content concerned Yinchenhao decoction on different animal model experiments for the treatment of cholestasis. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed based on the SYstematic Review Center for Laboratory animal Experimentation Animal Experiment Bias Risk Assessment Tool. A meta-analysis was conducted with RevMan 5.3 software according to the Cochrane tool. Nineteen studies on a total of 404 animals were included with five kinds of experimental animal models. The results showed that serum total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin and total bile acid in the group treated with Yinchenhao decoction were significantly lower than those in the model group (P {\textless} 0.00001). The alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels in the Yinchenhao decoction group were also significantly reduced (P {\textless} 0.00001). The subgroup analysis of the different models showed that Yinchenhao decoction had a significant effect on the bile duct ligation model, and there was a significant reduction in TBIL, DBIL and ALT levels (P {\textless} 0.00001) in ANIT-induced cholestasis. After 24 hours of Yinchenhao decoction treatment, there was no significant difference in TBIL levels (P = 0.34), but after 48 and 72 hours of treatment, the TBIL levels were significantly reduced compared with the model group (P {\textless} 0.00001). There was no significant difference in DBIL after 48 hours of administration (P = 0.26), but compared with the model group, Yinchenhao decoction could significantly reduce the DBIL levels after 48 hours of treatment (P {\textless} 0.0003). Yinchenhao decoction could significantly reduce the ALT levels after 24, 48 and 72 hours (P {\textless} 0.006). Yinchenhao decoction was able to significantly reduce the levels of TBIL, DBIL and ALT on different rat species: Wistar and Sprague Dawley (P = 0.0001; P = 0.0002). The preclinical evidence indicated that Yinchenhao decoction might be a potent and promising agent for cholestasis. Moreover, this conclusion should be further confirmed with more well-designed researches.},

In animal studies, mice treated with MSCs had significantly lower disease activity index (DAI) than that in the control group: the 1st day (standardized mean difference (SMD) - 0.753, p = 0.027), the 3rd day (SMD - 1.634, p = 0.000), the 5th day (SMD - 2.124, p = 0.000), the 7th day (SMD - 5.327, p = 0.000), the 9th day (SMD - 2.979, p = 0.000), and the 14th day (SMD - 5.032, p = 0.000). Lower histopathological score (HS) (SMD - 5.15, p {\textless} 0.05) and longer colon length (SMD 2.147, p = 0.001) in mice treated with MSCs were also indicated. The main outcome in clinical trials showed, compared with control group, healing rate of patients accompanied by MSC therapy elevated obviously: MSCs vs 5-aminosalicylic acids (5-ASA) (RR = 2.317, p = 0.000) and MSCs + 5-ASA vs placebo + 5-ASA (RR = 5.118). The analytical data in 4 trials conducted with single-arm studies also demonstrated increased healing rate (0.787) after MSC treatment (p = 0.000). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis results supported that MSCs could be an underlying method of treating UC.},

A systematic review of the prevalence over time in different countries may improve our understanding of gastrointestinal helminthiasis in chickens and subsequently lead to improved poultry health. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to provide an overview of the published information regarding the epidemiology and the diagnostic approaches of chicken helminth infection. Six databases were searched for studies, and a total of 2,985 articles published between 1942 and 2019 were identified and subsequently screened for eligibility using title or abstract and full text assessment, resulting in 191 publications to be used in the study. Postmortem diagnostics (73.8\%) and the flotation technique (28.8\%) were commonly used to detect helminth infections with a pooled prevalence of 79.4\% ranging from 4 to 100\%. More than 30 helminth species in chicken populations were identified including Ascaridia galli (35.9\%), Heterakis gallinarum (28.5\%), Capillaria spp. (5.90\%), and Raillietina spp. (19.0\%) being the most prevalent. The reported prevalence of helminth infection decreased over time in developing countries while it increased in the developed world. Chicken kept in backyard and free-range systems had a markedly higher pooled prevalence of helminth infection (82.6 and 84.8\%, respectively) than those housed in cage production systems (63.6\%). This may indicate the need for more rigorous control and prevention measures in free-range and backyard production systems using regular deworming coupled with access to early and accurate diagnosis allowing for early intervention.},

Hence the effects of these supplements on the gut microbiome are of great interest, and may clarify their mode of action, or explain heterogeneity in therapeutic responses. We conducted a systematic review of animal and human studies reporting the effects of GS or CS on gut microbial composition. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus databases for journal articles in English from database inception until July 2018, using search terms microbiome, microflora, intestinal microbiota/flora, gut microbiota/flora and glucosamine or chondroitin. Eight original articles reported the effects of GS or CS on microbiome composition in adult humans (four articles) or animals (four articles). Studies varied significantly in design, supplementation protocols, and microbiome assessment methods. There was moderate-quality evidence for an association between CS exposure and increased abundance of genus Bacteroides in the murine and human gut, and low-quality evidence for an association between CS exposure and an increase in Desulfovibrio piger species, an increase in Bacteroidales S24-7 family, and a decrease in Lactobacillus. We discuss the possible metabolic implications of these changes for the host. For GS, evidence of effects on gut microbiome was limited to one low-quality study. This review highlights the importance of considering the potential influence of oral CS supplements on gut microbiota when evaluating their effects and safety for the host.},

Studies were nominated for inclusion using an a priori defined protocol with preselected criteria, and studies were excluded from analysis if they did not include sufficient details about the exposure, dosimetry or experimental protocol, or if they lacked a sham-exposed group. Overall, 62 studies were identified that have investigated the effects of RF fields on spatial memory and place learning and have been published since 1993. Of these, 17 studies were excluded, 20 studies reported no significant field-related effects, 21 studies reported significant impairments or deficits, and four studies reported beneficial consequences. The data do not suggest whether these outcomes are related to specific differences in exposure or testing conditions, or simply represent chance. However, some studies have suggested possible molecular mechanisms for the observed effects, but none of these has been substantiated through independent replication. Further behavioural studies could prove useful to resolve this situation, and it is suggested that these studies should use a consistent animal model with standardized exposure and testing protocols, and with detailed dosimetry provided by heterogeneous, anatomically-realistic animal models.},

A number of multilevel random-effect meta-analysis models were fitted to estimate mean occurrence rate of antimicrobial-resistant thermotolerant Campylobacter and to compare them throughout the years and among the species, food-producing animals (i.e., bovine, pigs, broilers, hen, goat, and sheep), country of origin, sample type, methodology to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility, and the species of Campylobacter. Among the considered antibiotics, thermotolerant Campylobacter showed the highest resistance to tetracycline (pool estimate [PE] = 0.493; 95\% CI 0.466-0.519), nalidixic acid (PE = 0.385; 95\% CI 0.348-0.423), and ciprofloxacin (PE = 0.376; 95\% CI 0.339-0.415). In general, the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter spp. was higher in hen, broilers, and swine. Campylobacter coli showed a higher prevalence of antimicrobial resistance than Campylobacter jejuni. Independent of the antimicrobial evaluated, the disk diffusion method showed higher prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter than the methods based on the minimum inhibitory concentration estimation. The meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter is relevant essentially in foods derived from hens and broilers, and it was observed worldwide. The prevalence of this pathogen is of public health importance and the increase in the prevalence of Campylobacter strains resistant to the antimicrobial of choice worsens the situation, hence, national authorities must monitor the situation in each country with the aim to establish the appropriate risk management measures.},

Included studies had to investigate local effects induced by Bothrops snake venom in any animal model using any type of photobiomodulation irradiation and at least one quantitative measure of local effects of Bothrops envenomation. Sixteen studies were selected from 54 original articles targeted PBMT (low-level laser or light emitting diode) as a complementary tool for local effects treatment induced by snakebites, and all its assessments. Articles were critically assessed by two independent raters with a structured tool for rating the research quality.

	abstract = {Current myocarditis guidelines do not advocate treatment to prevent myocardial injury and scar deposition in patients with myocarditis and normal left ventricular ejection fraction. We aimed to ascertain the utility of beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and antagonists of the renin-angiotensin system in ameliorating myocardial injury, scar formation and calcification in animal in vivo models of myocarditis. The project was prospectively registered with the PROSPERO database of systematic reviews (CRD42018089336). Primary outcomes (necrosis, fibrosis and calcification) were meta-analysed with random-effects modelling. 52 studies were systematically reviewed. Meta-analysis was performed compared with untreated controls. In each study, we identified all independent comparisons of treatment versus control groups. The pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) indicated treatment reduced necrosis by 16.9\% (71 controlled analyses, 95\% CI 13.2-20.7\%; P {\textless} 0.001), however there was less evidence of an effect after accounting for publication bias. Treatment led to a 12.8\% reduction in fibrosis (73 controlled analyses, 95\% CI 7.6-18.0\%; P {\textless} 0.001). After accounting for publication bias this was attenuated to 7.8\% but remained significant. Treatment reduced calcification by 4.1\% (28 controlled analyses, 95\% CI 0.2-8.0\%; P {\textless} 0.0395). We observed significant heterogeneity in effect size in all primary endpoints, which was predominantly driven by differences between drug categories. Beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were the only agents that were effective for both necrosis and fibrosis, while only ACE inhibitors had a significant effect on calcification. This study provides evidence for a role for ACE inhibitors and beta blockers to prevent myocardial injury and scar deposition in in vivo models of myocarditis. There is a need for further well-designed studies to assess the translational application of these treatments.},

	abstract = {Mycobacterium ulcerans is the causative agent of Buruli ulcer, also known in Australia as Daintree ulcer or Bairnsdale ulcer. This destructive skin disease is characterized by extensive and painless necrosis of the skin and soft tissue with the formation of large ulcers, commonly on the leg or arm. To date, 33 countries with tropical, subtropical and temperate climates in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Western Pacific have reported cases of Buruli ulcer. The disease is rarely fatal, although it may lead to permanent disability and/or disfigurement if not treated appropriately or in time. It is the third most common mycobacterial infection in the world after tuberculosis and leprosy. The precise mode of transmission of M. ulcerans is yet to be elucidated. Nevertheless, it is possible that the mode of transmission varies with different geographical areas and epidemiological settings. The knowledge about the possible routes of transmission and potential animal reservoirs of M. ulcerans is poorly understood and still remains patchy. Infectious diseases arise from the interaction of agent, host and environment. The majority of emerging or remerging infectious disease in human populations is spread by animals: either wildlife, livestock or pets. Animals may act as hosts or reservoirs and subsequently spread the organism to the environment or directly to the human population. The reservoirs may or may not be the direct source of infection for the hosts; however, they play a major role in maintenance of the organism in the environment, and in the mode of transmission. This remains valid for M. ulcerans. Possums have been suggested as one of the reservoir of M. ulcerans in south-eastern Australia, where possums ingest M. ulcerans from the environment, amplify them and shed the organism through their faeces. We conducted a systematic review with selected key words on PubMed and INFORMIT databases to aggregate available published data on animal reservoirs of M. ulcerans around the world. After certain inclusion and exclusion criteria were implemented, a total of 17 studies was included in the review. A variety of animals around the world e.g., rodents, shrews, possums (ringtail and brushtail), horses, dogs, alpacas, koalas and Indian flap-shelled turtles have been recorded as being infected with M. ulcerans. The majority of studies included in this review identified animal reservoirs as predisposing to the emergence and reemergence of M. ulcerans infection. Taken together, from the selected studies in this systematic review, it is clear that exotic wildlife and native mammals play a significant role as reservoirs for M. ulcerans.},

Recent preclinical evidence implicates cannabinoids as powerful regulators of cell growth and differentiation, as well as potential anti-cancer agents. The aim of this review was to evaluate the effect of cannabinoids on in vivo prostate cancer models. The databases searched included PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to August 2020. Articles reporting on the effect of cannabinoids on prostate cancer were deemed eligible. We identified six studies that were all found to be based on in vivo/xenograft animal models. Results: In PC3 and DU145 xenografts, WIN55,212-2 reduced cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, in LNCaP xenografts, WIN55,212-2 reduced cell proliferation by 66-69\%. PM49, which is a synthetic cannabinoid quinone, was also found to result in a significant inhibition of tumor growth of up to 90\% in xenograft models of LNCaP and 40\% in xenograft models of PC3 cells, respectively. All studies have reported that the treatment of prostate cancers in in vivo/xenograft models with various cannabinoids decreased the size of the tumor, the outcomes of which depended on the dose and length of treatment. Within the limitation of these identified studies, cannabinoids were shown to reduce the size of prostate cancer tumors in animal models. However, further well-designed and controlled animal studies are warranted to confirm these findings.},

A database was designed based on published papers reporting the use of probiotics in laying hens. Articles were rigorously selected according to the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) protocols. The final database consisted of 47 in vivo studies with 190 treatment units. The statistical meta-analysis was performed according to the linear mixed models by using R software version 3.6.3. It was shown that dietary addition of probiotics linearly increased (P {\textless} 0.001) egg production and concomitantly decreased (P {\textless} 0.01) feed egg ratio (FER) with a linear pattern. Egg mass and feed intake were not associated with the probiotic treatment. Concerning egg quality parameters, probiotics did not affect egg weight but increased eggshell thickness (P {\textless} 0.001), eggshell weight (P {\textless} 0.01) and yolk colour (P {\textless} 0.01). Probiotics reduced (P {\textless} 0.05) cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol while elevated (P {\textless} 0.05) high-density lipoprotein cholesterol blood concentrations. In conclusion, poultry products with health-promoting properties can be obtained with the use of probiotics which positively affect production performance, egg quality and blood metabolites parameters in lying hens.},

The present paper is the first systematic review that integrates evidence from animal and human trials regarding the possibility to condition the endocrine responses. Twenty-six animal and eight human studies were included in the review. We demonstrated that there is accumulating evidence that classical conditioning processes are able to influence specific endocrine responses, such as cortocosterone/cortisol and insulin, while more limited evidence exists for other hormones. Animal and human studies were generally consistent in their findings; however, the limited number of human studies makes it difficult to generalize and translate the results of animal research to humans. Next to methodological recommendations for future studies, we suggest several ways how classically conditioned endocrine responses can be used in clinical practice.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13054-018-2123-9},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arterial hyperoxia may induce vasoconstriction and reduce cardiac output, which is particularly undesirable in patients who already have compromised perfusion of vital organs. Due to the inaccessibility of vital organs in humans, vasoconstrictive effects of hyperoxia have primarily been studied in animal models. However, the results of these studies vary substantially. Here, we investigate the variation in magnitude of the hyperoxia effect among studies and explore possible sources of heterogeneity, such as vascular region and animal species. METHOD: Pubmed and Embase were searched for eligible studies up to November 2017. In vivo and ex vivo animal studies reporting on vascular tone changes induced by local or systemic normobaric hyperoxia were included. Experiments with co-interventions (e.g. disease or endothelium removal) or studies focusing on lung, brain or fetal vasculature or the ductus arteriosus were not included. We extracted data pertaining to species, vascular region, blood vessel characteristics and method of hyperoxia induction. Overall effect sizes were estimated with a standardized mean difference (SMD) random effects model. RESULTS: We identified a total of 60 studies, which reported data on 67 in vivo and 18 ex vivo experiments. In the in vivo studies, hyperoxia caused vasoconstriction with an SMD of - 1.42 (95\% CI - 1.65 to - 1.19). Ex vivo, the overall effect size was SMD - 0.56 (95\% CI - 1.09 to - 0.03). Between-study heterogeneity (I(2)) was high for in vivo (72\%, 95\% CI 62 to 85\%) and ex vivo studies (86\%, 95\% CI 78 to 98\%). In vivo, in comparison to the overall effect size, hyperoxic vasoconstriction was less pronounced in the intestines and skin (P = 0.03) but enhanced in the cremaster muscle region (P {\textless} 0.001). Increased constriction was seen in vessels 15-25 μm in diameter. Hyperoxic constriction appeared to be directly proportional to oxygen concentration. For ex vivo studies, heterogeneity could not be explained with subgroup analysis. CONCLUSION: The effect of hyperoxia on vascular tone is substantially higher in vivo than ex vivo. The magnitude of the constriction is most pronounced in vessels {\textasciitilde} 15-25 μm in diameter and is proportional to the level of hyperoxia. Relatively increased constriction was seen in muscle vasculature, while reduced constriction was seen in the skin and intestines.},

The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review to assess the evidence available relating to the question "In Thoroughbred Racehorses with naturally occurring joint disease, what is known about the safety of intraarticular medications in horses?" A systematic review was carried out, and 537 articles were identified; 17 were identified for qualitative analysis. This study aims to allow equine veterinary practitioners to assess the available literature for evidence of the potential complications from intraarticular use of corticosteroids in horses. A search strategy was formulated to identify available evidence on the safety of intraarticular corticosteroids in Thoroughbred racehorses. Studies were retrieved from literature search engines, and titles and abstracts were screened for full text inclusion. Studies with the highest evidence quality underwent qualitative analysis with a standardized questionnaire. The results show that there are multiple studies that look at the effect of intraarticular medications from experimental animals, but there are few studies of the highest quality of evidence that address clinical scenarios. Two cohort studies have explored some issues around intraarticular medications. In conclusion, practitioners should be aware that the use of intraarticular corticosteroids may be associated with negative consequences. Only a selection of articles was available, therefore the review is at risk of selection bias associated with the articles that are selected from the literature. An application of this study is it should inform equine practitioners over the status of the current literature on the use of corticosteroids in Thoroughbred racehorses.},

Where free-roaming dogs exist in high densities, there are significant implications for public health, animal welfare, and wildlife. Approaches to manage dog populations include culling, fertility control, and sheltering. Understanding the effectiveness of each of these interventions is important in guiding future dog population management. We present the results of a systematic review of published studies investigating dog population management, to assess: (1) where and when studies were carried out; (2) what population management methods were used; and (3) what was the effect of the method. We evaluated the reporting quality of the published studies for strength of evidence assessment. The systematic review resulted in a corpus of 39 papers from 15 countries, reporting a wide disparity of approaches and measures of effect. We synthesised the management methods and reported effects. Fertility control was most investigated and had the greatest reported effect on dog population size. Reporting quality was low for power calculations (11\%), sample size calculations (11\%), and the use of control populations (17\%). We provide recommendations for future studies to use common metrics and improve reporting quality, study design, and modelling approaches in order to allow better assessment of the true impact of dog population management.},

Various approaches to vaccination against the major viral pathogens have been investigated, including timing. It is thought that beef cattle entering feedlots may not be able to adequately respond to vaccination due to the stresses of shipping and processing. A meta-analysis was performed to compare the effectiveness of on-arrival vaccination to vaccination delayed 7 or more days following arrival, using a modified-live viral (MLV) vaccine against bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenza-3 (PI3), and bovine viral diarrhea types 1 and 2 (BVD 1 and 2), on outcomes of BRD morbidity, retreatment risk, and mortality. Eight studies were identified comparing vaccination timing in feedlot cattle via literature search. Mantel-Haenzsel risk ratios were calculated for each outcome, and Forest plots were constructed. In the studies identified, there was no difference in BRD morbidity risk, retreatment risk, or BRD mortality between calves vaccinated at arrival or delayed. Based on the data from the studies analyzed, it would not appear that there is an advantage or disadvantage in terms or morbidity, retreatment risk, or mortality in delaying vaccination.},

	abstract = {Development of ketosis in high-producing dairy cows contributes to several animal health issues and highlights the need for a better understanding of the genetic basis of metabolic diseases. To evaluate the pattern of differential gene expression in the liver of cows under negative energy balance (NEB), and under subclinical and clinical ketosis, a meta-analysis of gene expression and genome-wide association studies results was performed. An initial systematic review identified 118 articles based on the key words "cow," "liver," "negative energy balance," "ketosis," "expression," "qPCR," "microarray," "proteomic," "RNA-Seq," and "GWAS." After further screening for only peer-reviewed and pertinent articles for gene expression during NEB and clinical and subclinical ketosis (considering plasma levels of β-hydroxybutyrate), 20 articles were included in the analysis. From the systematic review, 430 significant SNPs identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were assigned to genes reported in gene expression studies by considering chromosome and base pair positions in the ARS-UCD 1.2 bovine assembly. Venn diagrams were created to integrate the data obtained in the systematic review, and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis was carried out using official gene names. A QTL enrichment analysis was also performed to identify potential positional candidate loci. Twenty-four significant SNPs were located within the coordinates of differentially expressed genes located on chromosomes 2, 3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 27, and 29. Three significant metabolic pathways were associated with NEB and subclinical and clinical ketosis. In addition, 2 important genes, PPARA (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha) and ACACA (acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase α), were identified, which were differentially expressed in the 3 metabolic conditions. The PPARA gene is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and fatty liver disease and the ACACA gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-coenzyme A to malonyl-coenzyme A, which is a rate-limiting step in fatty acid synthesis. Gene network analysis revealed co-expression interactions among 34 genes associated with functions involving fatty acid transport and fatty acid metabolism. For the annotated QTL, 9 QTL were identified for ketosis. The genes FN1 (fibronectin 1) and PTK2 (protein tyrosine kinase 2), which are mainly involved in cell adhesion and formation of extracellular matrix constituents, were enriched for QTL previously associated with the trait "ketosis" on chromosome 2 and for the trait "milk iron content" on chromosome 14, respectively. This integration of gene expression and GWAS data provides an additional understanding of the genetic background of NEB and subclinical and clinical ketosis in dairy cattle. Thus, it is a useful approach to identify biological mechanisms underlying these metabolic conditions in dairy cattle.},

Although the economic costs and public health safety risks associated with the disease are considerable, the overall epidemiology of the Chinese yak (Bos grunniens) bTB is unclear. To fully reveal the basic prevalence of yak bTB in different regions of China, we searched five databases including PubMed, Science Direct, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), Wanfang and Chongqing VIP. Based on the incidence and prevalence of yak tuberculosis in China from 1982 to 2020, a meta-analysis of yak bTB in China was established for the first time. By formulating the search formula, 97 studies were searched in five databases. According to the established exclusion criteria and excluded comments and repeated and irrelevance research, we finally selected 19 cross-sectional studies, which showed the prevalence of bTB in Chinese yaks. Random-effect meta-regression model analysis showed that the estimated prevalence of 122,729 yaks in China was 1.0 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.0-1.0). The regional prevalence varies greatly, northwest China prevalence rate 0. 39\% (95\% CI: 0.2-0. 64) and southwest China prevalence rate 2.59\% (95\% CI: 1.94-3.34); in terms of province level, the prevalence was highest in Tibet 2.59\% (95\% CI: 1.94-3.34), followed by Xinjiang 2.36\% (95\% CI: 0.86-4.58), and Shanxi has the lowest 0.00\% (95\% CI: 0.00-0.98). This systematic review and meta-analysis identified the estimated prevalence of bTB in Chinese yaks and estimated the underlying factors associated with bTB, including geographic location, sampling year, age, and TB detection method.

The current systematic review and meta-analysis was planned to determine the status of fasciolosis among domestic ruminants, including cattle, buffalo, goat, and sheep at the industrial slaughterhouses in Iran, between the years 2000 and 2016. Eight databases, four English and four Persian, were searched. Our findings demonstrated that 2.6\% of all inspected livers of slaughtered ruminants were infected with Fasciola spp. during 2000–2016. The mean prevalence of fasciolosis for cattle, buffalo, goat, and sheep was 21\%, 4.2\%, 2\%, and 2.4\%, respectively. Additionally, most studies were performed on cattle 25 (39.6\%), sheep 24 (38 \%), and goat 12 (19\%), respectively, and just 2 (3.1\%) studies were performed on buffalo. The prevalence of animal fasciolosis has significantly decreased among domestic ruminants in Iran except for cattle. In addition, the prevalence of this disease in Northern and Western regions of the country has remained at hypo-endemic level. The results present updated gathered information on the epidemiology of fasciolosis in domestic ruminants in Iran, and will expand the screening strategies to improve health and reduce economic impacts among farm animals.},

In this investigation, we systematically reviewed the distribution of anaplasmosis among domestic ruminants in Iran. Five and four English and Persian databases were studied, respectively, based on keywords and throughout 17 years (2001-2017). Thirty-eight articles were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Totally, 5093 cattle, 1958 sheep, and 1232 goats corresponding to prevalence of Anaplasma infection from different areas of Iran were examined. The total prevalence of Anaplasma infection was estimated to be 34\% (95\% CI 27\%, 41\%) in domestic ruminants. Based on our data, Khozestan (54\%) and Khorasan Razavi (46\%) provinces were the most prevalent areas in Iran and Kerman (3\%) and Hamedan (1\%) provinces are the lowest. The highest prevalence of Anaplasma spp. infection was belonged to A. ovis (44\%) and the lowest to A. phagocytophilum (1\%) with a significant difference among them (p {\textless} .001). In addition, the most common diagnostic tests were PCR (54\%), microscopy (35\%) and ELISA (7\%) assays. The high prevalence of ovine and bovine anaplasmosis in Iran, confirms the stability situations of animal anaplasmosis in the studied regions particularly northeastern and southwestern parts of the country. Our data offer valuable and encouraging information as regards the current situation of anaplasmosis in domestic livestock in Iran, which might be useful for active and passive surveillance and preventing plans.},

This systematic review was conducted to summarize effects of the consumption of fortified dairy products on biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk. MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases were used to perform searches to include studies published up to 30 April 2018. Randomized clinical trials with human subjects consuming dairy products fortified with phytosterols, FAs, vitamins or minerals and relating this consumption with cardiometabolic health were included in this review. Risk of bias assessment according to Cochrane guidelines was performed to determine the quality of the trials. Forty-one studies were finally selected for this synthesis; the selected studies tested dairy products fortified with the following nutrients and bioactive components: phytosterols (n = 31), FAs (n = 8), and vitamin D (n = 2). We found that the consumption of phytosterol-fortified dairy, led to an overall LDL cholesterol reduction of -0.36 (-0.41, -0.31) mmol/L, P {\textless} 0.001; this decrease was mainly related to the dosage. Likewise, consumption of ω-3 FA-fortified dairy products resulted in a plasma LDL cholesterol reduction of -0.18 (-0.27, -0.09) mmol/L as well as a decrease of -0.18 (-0.32, -0.05) mmol/L in triacylglycerols (TG). Performing meta-analyses of the consumption of dairy products fortified with vitamin D or FAs other than ω-3 FAs and biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk was not possible because of the few available publications. Our results indicate that consumption of dairy products fortified with phytosterols and ω-3 FAs can lead to a reduction of LDL cholesterol and consumption of fortified dairy products fortified with ω-3 FAs can reduce TG concentration. However, more studies with homogeneous designs are needed to determine the advantages of using dairy products as fortification vehicles to prevent cardiometabolic risk.},

The use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in the health sector is propitious and has been adopted by human and animal health professionals as an important tool in spatial analyses of health. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review on the geoprocessing and spatial analysis techniques adopted for mapping risk areas of human and animal leptospirosis. The articles were collected on scientific platforms by entering the following terms: SIG/GIS, leptospirose/leptospirosis, area de risco/risk area and distribuicao espacial/spatial distribution, and included in the study if they met the following criteria: a) publication in the period from 1998 to 2017; b) identification of risk areas and/or spatial distribution of leptospirosis as one of the research topics; and c) application of GIS in the methodology. As a result, we found 40 articles, published by 15 different countries, which adopted GIS for the spatial analysis and identification of risk areas of leptospirosis. Among these, only 45\% (18) conducted an spatial statistical analysis. Brazil and USA had the highest numbers of publications, 16 and 7 articles, respectively. From 2007, the use of GIS and spatial analysis techniques, applied to the theme of this study, have been intensified and diversified, and 93\% of the articles elected for this review were published from 2007 to 2017. The results point to a progressive interest of health professionals in applying these techniques for monitoring and conducting epidemiological analyses of leptospirosis, besides indicating a greater need for intersectoral integration between health professionals and others, in the use of spatial analysis and GIS techniques.},

By using the framework of a systematic review, we integrated the preclinical and clinical evidence to investigate the relevance of angiotensin-inhibiting drugs on T. cruzi infections. From a comprehensive and structured search in biomedical databases, only original studies were analysed. In preclinical and clinical studies, captopril, enalapril and losartan were RAS-modulating drugs used. The main in vitro findings indicated that these drugs increased parasite uptake per host cells, IL-12 expression by infected dendritic cells and IFN-P by T lymphocytes, in addition to attenuating IL-10 and IL-17 production by CD8 + T cells. In animal models, reduced parasitaemia, tissue parasitism, leucocytes infiltration and mortality were often observed in T. cruzi-infected animals receiving RAS-modulating drugs. In patients with Chagas' disease, these drugs exerted a controversial impact on cytokine and hormone levels, and a limited effect on cardiovascular function. Considering a detailed evaluation of reporting and methodological quality, the current preclinical and clinical evidence is at high risk of bias, and we hope that our critical analysis will be useful in mitigating the risk of bias in further studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-cholera Vibrio bacteria are a major cause of foodborne illness in the United States. Raw oysters are commonly implicated in gastroenteritis caused by pathogenic Vibrio parahaemolyticus. In response to outbreaks in 1997-1998, the US Food and Drug Administration developed a nation-wide quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) of V. parahaemolyticus in raw oysters in 2005. The QMRA identified information gaps that new research may address. Incidence of sporadic V. parahaemolyticus illness has recently increased and, as oyster consumption increases and sea temperatures rise, V. parahaemolyticus outbreaks may become more frequent, posing health concerns. Updated and region-specific QMRAs will improve the accuracy and precision of risk of infection estimates. OBJECTIVES: We identify research to support an updated QMRA of V. parahaemolyticus from oysters harvested in Chesapeake Bay and Puget Sound, focusing on observational and experimental research on post-harvest practices (PHPs) published from 2004 to 2019. METHODS: A predefined search strategy was applied to PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Science.gov, NAL Agricola, and Google Scholar. Study eligibility criteria were defined using a population, intervention, comparator, and outcome statement. Reviewers independently coded abstracts for inclusion/exclusion using predefined criteria. Data were extracted and study quality and relevance evaluated based on published guidance for food safety risk assessments. Findings were synthesized using a weight of evidence approach. RESULTS: Of 12,174 articles retrieved, 93 were included for full-text review. Twenty-seven studies were found to be high quality and high relevance, including studies on cold storage, high hydrostatic pressure, depuration, and disinfectant, and other PHPs. High hydrostatic pressure consistently emerged as the most effective PHP in reducing abundance of V. parahaemolyticus. DISCUSSION: Limitations of the knowledge base and review approach involve the type and quantity of data reported. Future research should focus on PHPs for which few or no high quality and high relevance studies exist, such as irradiation and relaying.},

	abstract = {The Bacterial Endotoxin Test (BET) is a method for exclusion of endotoxin-related pyrogen contamination in pharmaceutical products, as an alternative to the Rabbit Pyrogen Test (RPT). However, BET does not detect a broad range of biologically relevant pyrogens, and interferences can limit its practical use for different medical products. This work aimed to scope the evidence in the scientific literature for case-by-case validity assessments of BET in different uses for medical products. A search strategy was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science in April 2020, according to the PRISMA-ScR statement. Twenty-two references were included, evaluating medical products for endotoxin contamination through both BET and RPT according to standardized protocols. A critical appraisal was performed through ToxRTool, followed by data extraction and qualitative synthesis of outcomes and methodological issues. Four classes of products assessed by BET were identified, including nanoparticles, drugs, blood and biological products. A considerable variation was observed on the BET methods used. Collectively, the evidence indicates different factors influencing the outcome of BET, including the chemical nature of samples that may cause interference depending on the selected method. While some applications to medical products appear adequate, others, such as nanoparticles, may require the use of different in vitro pyrogen testing methods, reinforcing the need for case-by-case validation for each BET method and type of medical product.},

	abstract = {The discovery of antibiotics brought with it many advances in the health and well-being of humans and animals; however, in recent years development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has increasingly become a concern. Much of the antibiotic use on dairy farms is for disease management in mature cattle, and AMR in fecal organisms is relatively rare in this group. However, young dairy calves often carry high levels of AMR in their fecal Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, which could provide a potential reservoir of AMR genes on dairy farms. To develop practical and effective antibiotic stewardship policies for dairy calf rearing, it is vital to have a solid understanding of the current state of knowledge regarding AMR in these animals. A systematic review process was used to summarize the current scientific literature regarding AMR in fecal S. enterica and E. coli and associations between management practices and AMR prevalence in dairy calves in the United States and Canada. Seven online databases were searched for literature published from 1997 to 2018. Multiple studies indicated an association between preweaned calves and increased risk of fecal shedding of resistant bacteria, compared to other animal groups on dairy farms. There also was evidence, although less consistent, of an impact of antibiotic treatment, antibiotic-containing milk replacer feeding, and feeding nonsalable or waste milk (WM) on the presence of AMR bacteria. Overall, the research summarized in this systematic review highlights the need for continued research on the impact of management practices, including antibiotic use, WM feeding, and disease prevention practices in reducing AMR in E. coli and S. enterica in dairy calves. In addition, few data were available on physiological and microbiological factors that may contribute to the high relative populations of resistant bacteria in young calves, suggesting another valuable area of future research.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVERiluzole is a glutamatergic modulator that has recently shown potential for neuroprotection after spinal cord injury (SCI). While the effects of riluzole are extensively documented in animal models of SCI, there remains heterogeneity in findings. Moreover, there is a paucity of data on the pharmacology of riluzole and its effects in humans. For the present study, the authors systematically reviewed the literature to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of riluzole in SCI.METHODSThe PubMed database was queried from 1996 to September 2018 to identify animal studies and clinical trials involving riluzole administration for SCI. Once articles were identified, they were processed for year of publication, study design, subject type, injury model, number of subjects in experimental and control groups, dose, timing/route of administration, and outcomes.RESULTSA total of 37 studies were included in this study. Three placebo-controlled clinical trials were included with a total of 73 patients with a mean age of 39.1 years (range 18-70 years). For the clinical trials included within this study, the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale distributions for SCI were 42.6\% grade A, 25\% grade B, 26.6\% grade C, and 6.2\% grade D. Key findings from studies in humans included decreased nociception, improved motor function, and attenuated spastic reflexes. Twenty-six animal studies (24 in vivo, 1 in vitro, and 1 including both in vivo and in vitro) were included. A total of 520 animals/in vitro specimens were exposed to riluzole and 515 animals/in vitro specimens underwent other treatment for comparison. The average dose of riluzole for intraperitoneal, in vivo studies was 6.5 mg/kg (range 1-10 mg/kg). Key findings from animal studies included behavioral improvement, histopathological tissue sparing, and modified electrophysiology after SCI. Eight studies examined the pharmacology of riluzole in SCI. Key findings from pharmacological studies included riluzole dose-dependent effects on glutamate uptake and its modified bioavailability after SCI in both animal and clinical models.CONCLUSIONSSCI has many negative sequelae requiring neuroprotective intervention. While still relatively new in its applications for SCI, both animal and human studies demonstrate riluzole to be a promising pharmacological intervention to attenuate the devastating effects of this condition.},

	abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a chronic disease of cattle that impacts productivity and represents a major public health threat. Despite the considerable economic costs and zoonotic risk consequences associated with the disease, accurate estimates of bTB prevalence are lacking in many countries, including India, where national control programmes are not yet implemented and the disease is considered endemic. To address this critical knowledge gap, we performed a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis to estimate bTB prevalence in cattle in India and provide a foundation for the future formulation of rational disease control strategies and the accurate assessment of economic and health impact risks. The literature search was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and identified 285 cross-sectional studies on bTB in cattle in India across four electronic databases and handpicked publications. Of these, 44 articles were included, contributing a total of 82,419 cows and buffaloes across 18 states and one union territory in India. Based on a random-effects (RE) meta-regression model, the analysis revealed a pooled prevalence estimate of 7.3\% (95\% CI: 5.6, 9.5), indicating that there may be an estimated 21.8 million (95\% CI: 16.6, 28.4) infected cattle in India-a population greater than the total number of dairy cows in the United States. The analyses further suggest that production system, species, breed, study location, diagnostic technique, sample size and study period are likely moderators of bTB prevalence in India and need to be considered when developing future disease surveillance and control programmes. Taken together with the projected increase in intensification of dairy production and the subsequent increase in the likelihood of zoonotic transmission, the results of our study suggest that attempts to eliminate tuberculosis from humans will require simultaneous consideration of bTB control in cattle population in countries such as India.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.virusres.2019.197725},
	abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) was first described in 1921 as a highly fatal and contagious disease which caused severe outbreaks among settlers' pigs in British East Africa. Since then the disease has expanded its geographical distribution and is currently present in large parts of Africa, Europe and Asia and considered a global threat. Although ASF is typically associated with very high case fatality rates, a certain proportion of infected animals will recover from the infection and survive. Early on it was speculated that such survivors may act as carriers of the virus, and the importance of such carries for disease persistence and spread has since then almost become an established truth. However, the scientific basis for such a role of carriers may be questioned. With this in mind, the objective of this study was to review the available literature in a systematic way and to evaluate the available scientific evidence. The selection of publications for the review was based on a database search, followed by a stepwise screening process in order to exclude duplicates and non-relevant publications based on pre-defined exclusion criteria. By this process the number of publications finally included was reduced from the 3664 hits identified in the initial database search to 39 publications, from which data was then extracted and analysed. Based on this it was clear that a definition of an ASF virus carrier is lacking, and that in general any survivor or seropositive animal has been referred to as carrier. It was also clear that evidence of any significant role of such a carrier is absent. Two types of "survivors" could be defined: 1) pigs that do not die but develop a persistent infection, characterised by periodic viraemia and often but not always accompanied by some signs of subacute to chronic disease, and 2) pigs which clear the infection independently of virulence of the virus, and which are not persistently infected and will not present with prolonged virus excretion. There is no evidence that suggests that any of these categories of survivors can be considered as "healthy" carriers, i.e. pigs that show no sign of disease but can transmit the virus to in-contact pigs. However, localized virus persistence in lymphoid tissues may occur to some extent in any of the categories of survivors, which in theory may cause infection after oral uptake. To what extent this is relevant in reality, however, can be questioned given the virus dose generally needed for oral infection.},

	abstract = {The choice of animal-based traits to identify and deal with production diseases is often a challenge for pig farmers, researchers and other related professionals. This systematic review focused on production diseases, that is, the diseases that arise from management practices, affecting the digestive, locomotory and respiratory system of pigs. The aim was to classify all traits that have been measured and conduct a meta-analysis to quantify the impact of diseases on these traits so that these can be used as indicators for intervention. Data were extracted from 67 peer-reviewed publications selected from 2339 records. Traits were classified as productive (performance and carcass composition), behavioural, biochemical and molecular traits. A meta-analysis based on mixed models was performed on traits assessed more than five times across studies, using the package metafor of the R software. A total of 524 unique traits were recorded 1 to 31 times in a variety of sample material including blood, muscle, articular cartilage, bone or at the level of whole animal. No behavioural traits were recorded from the included experiments. Only 14 traits were measured on more than five occasions across studies. Traits within the biochemical, molecular and productive trait groups were reported most frequently in the published literature and were most affected by production diseases; among these were some cytokines (interleukin (IL) 1-β, IL6, IL8 and tumour necrosis factor-α), acute phase proteins (haptoglobin) and daily weight gain. Quantification of the influence of factors relating to animal characteristics or husbandry practices was not possible, due to the low frequency of reporting throughout the literature. To conclude, this study has permitted a holistic assessment of traits measured in the published literature to study production diseases occurring in various stages of the production cycle of pigs. It shows the lack of consensus and common measurements of traits to characterise production diseases within the scientific literature. Specific traits, most of them relating to performance characteristics or immunological response of pigs, are proposed for further study as potential tools for the prognosis and study of production diseases.},

Because animals need to be immobilised for image acquisition, fMRI is commonly performed under anaesthesia. The choice of anaesthetic protocols and may affect fMRI readouts, either directly or via changing physiological balance, and thereby threaten the scientific validity of fMRI in rodents. Methods: The present study systematically reviewed the literature investigating the influence of different anaesthesia regimes and changes in physiological parameters as confounders of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI in rats and mice. Four databases were searched, studies selected according to pre-defined criteria, and risk of bias assessed for each study. Results are reported in two separate articles; this part of the review focuses on effects of changes in physiological parameters. Results: A total of 121 publications was included, of which 49 addressed effects of changes in physiological parameters. Risk of bias was high in all included studies. Blood oxygenation [arterial partial pressure of oxygen (p(a)O(2))], ventilation [arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (p(a)CO(2))] and arterial blood pressure affected BOLD fMRI readouts across various experimental paradigms. Conclusions: Blood oxygenation, ventilation and arterial blood pressure should be monitored and maintained at stable physiological levels throughout experiments. Appropriate anaesthetic management and monitoring are crucial to obtain scientifically valid, reproducible results from fMRI studies in rodent models.},

As long as those factors cannot be objectively quantified, the scientific validity of fMRI in rodents is impaired. In the present systematic review, literature analyzing in rats and mice the influence of anesthesia regimes and concurrent physiological functions on blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI results was investigated. Studies from four databases that were searched were selected following pre-defined criteria. Two separate articles publish the results; the herewith presented article includes the analyses of 83 studies. Most studies found differences in BOLD fMRI readouts with different anesthesia drugs and dose rates, time points of imaging or when awake status was compared to anesthetized animals. To obtain scientifically valid, reproducible results from rodent fMRI studies, stable levels of anesthesia with agents suitable for the model under investigation as well as known and objectively quantifiable effects on readouts are, thus, mandatory. Further studies should establish dose ranges for standardized anesthetic protocols and determine time windows for imaging during which influence of anesthesia on readout is objectively quantifiable.},

	abstract = {Understanding the non-human reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens is critical for effective disease control, but identifying the relative contributions of the various reservoirs of multi-host pathogens is challenging. For Ross River virus (RRV), knowledge of the transmission dynamics, in particular the role of non-human species, is important. In Australia, RRV accounts for the highest number of human mosquito-borne virus infections. The long held dogma that marsupials are better reservoirs than placental mammals, which are better reservoirs than birds, deserves critical review. We present a review of 50 years of evidence on non-human reservoirs of RRV, which includes experimental infection studies, virus isolation studies and serosurveys. We find that whilst marsupials are competent reservoirs of RRV, there is potential for placental mammals and birds to contribute to transmission dynamics. However, the role of these animals as reservoirs of RRV remains unclear due to fragmented evidence and sampling bias. Future investigations of RRV reservoirs should focus on quantifying complex transmission dynamics across environments.},

However, current literature on the use of analgesics in sheep generally focuses on an industry or farm level of use. This structured review evaluates use and efficacy of analgesics administered to sheep in a biomedical research setting. Electronic databases were searched with terms related to analgesia in research sheep. After application of exclusion criteria, 29 peer-reviewed publications were evaluated from 1995 to 2018. Drugs used for analgesia in sheep include opioids, α₂ agonists, NSAID, local anesthetics, NMDA receptor antagonists, and calcium channel blockers. Opioid agonists have previously been considered short acting and of questionable efficacy in sheep, but newer modalities may provide effective analgesia. NSAID may exhibit an analgesic effect only when inflammatory pain is present and may not be beneficial for use in acute pain models. α₂ agonists provide effective yet short-lived analgesia; however, side effects are of concern. Local anesthetics were previously widely used as stand-alone agents, as alternatives to the use of general anesthetics in sheep. These agents have since fallen out of favor as sole agents. Despite this, they provide a valuable analgesic effect when used as adjuncts to general anesthetic regimes. The NMDA antagonist ketamine provided good analgesia and is likely underutilized as an analgesic agent in sheep. Future controlled studies should further evaluate the analgesic properties of ketamine in sheep.},

This study was performed to analyse the epidemiological data on taeniosis and cysticercosis in Serbia for the period 1990-2018. METHODS: Data on cases of T. saginata and T. solium infection were collected via a systematic search of published articles, the grey literature, and official reports, as well as by performing clinical observational studies of patients treated in the departments for infectious diseases of hospitals and university clinics in Serbia. RESULTS: A total of 212 cases of taeniosis were reported, all between 1997 and 2004 when taeniosis was notifiable (incidence range 0.04-0.9/100 000 population/year). From 1990 to 2018, 170 cases of cysticercosis (all but one of neurocysticercosis), were registered (incidence range 0-0.29/100 000 population/year), with a strong decrease since 2000 and a single case in the last 9 years. The annual number of cases of both taeniosis (Pearson's r = 0.914, p =  0.001) and cysticercosis (Pearson's r = 0.582, p = 0.014) correlated with the consumer price index. CONCLUSIONS: In Serbia, T. saginata and T. solium infections are autochthonous but occur only sporadically.

Fifty-three different infectious agents, all with zoonotic potential, were reported to be carried by commensal rats; 48 by the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) and 20 by the black rat (R. rattus). There was a tendency for rural areas to harbour more rat-borne microbes than urban areas regarding the brown rat, but the opposite could be observed for the black rat. The study clearly indicated that an improved surveillance on wild rats is needed in Europe, and further indicated the pathogens and geographical areas where the major focus is required. For example, six zoonotic microbes seemed to be clearly more geographically widespread in Europe than others; virulent or resistant E. coli, pathogenic Leptospira spp., Hymenolepis diminuta, H. nana, Capillaria hepatica and Toxoplasma gondii.},

During reoperations, the need for adhesiolysis results in increased operative time and a more complicated convalescence. In pre-clinical evaluation, adhesion barriers are tested for their efficacy in preventing 'de novo' adhesion formation, However, it is unknown to which extent barriers are tested for prevention of adhesion reformation. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the efficacy of commercially available adhesion barriers and laparoscopic adhesiolysis in preventing adhesion reformation in animal models. Pubmed and EMBASE were searched for studies which assessed peritoneal adhesion reformation after a standardized peritoneal injury (in the absence of an intra-peritoneal mesh), and reported the incidence of adhesions, or an adhesion score as outcome. Ninety-three studies were included. No study met the criteria for low risk of bias. None of the commercially available adhesion barriers significantly reduced the incidence of adhesion reformation. Three commercially available adhesion barriers reduced the adhesion score of reformed adhesions, namely Seprafilm (SMD 1.38[95\% CI]; p {\textless} 0.01), PEG (SMD 2.08[95\% CI]; p {\textless} 0.01) and Icodextrin (SMD 1.85[95\% CI]; p {\textless} 0.01). There was no difference between laparoscopic or open adhesiolysis with regard to the incidence of adhesion reformation (RR 1.14[95\% CI]; p ≥ 0.05) or the adhesion score (SMD 0.92[95\% CI]; p ≥ 0.05). Neither currently commercially available adhesion barriers, nor laparoscopic adhesiolysis without using an adhesion barrier, reduces the incidence of adhesion reformation in animal models.

MATERIALS \& METHODS: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science) were searched up to December 2019. Studies assessing the impact of PTH administration in experimental periodontitis in rodents have been identified. RESULTS: Amongst the 247 identified articles, 10 met the inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. Experimental periodontitis was mainly induced by ligature placement or surgically with a dental bur. All studies considered bone healing after PTH administration at different frequencies as primary outcome. Results showed that an intermittent administration of PTH promoted bone healing and neovascularization. Nevertheless, a decrease of soft tissue inflammation was also observed. CONCLUSION: Intermittent administration of PTH appears to enhance significantly periodontal healing and to promote alveolar bone regeneration. However, due to the risk of side effects, the development of scaffolds allowing its local and time-controlled delivery is of importance.},

The aim of this study was to provide a systematic overview of externally validated and commercially available PLF technologies, which could be used for sensor-based welfare assessment in dairy cattle. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify externally validated sensor technologies. Out of 1,111 publications initially extracted from databases, only 42 studies describing 30 tools (including prototypes) met requirements for external validation. Moreover, through market search, 129 different retailed technologies with application for animal-based welfare assessment were identified. In total, only 18 currently retailed sensors have been externally validated (14\%). The highest validation rate was found for systems based on accelerometers (30\% of tools available on the market have validation records), while the lower rates were obtained for cameras (10\%), load cells (8\%), miscellaneous milk sensors (8\%), and boluses (7\%). Validated traits concerned animal activity, feeding and drinking behavior, physical condition, and health of animals. The majority of tools were validated on adult cows. Non-active behavior (lying and standing) and rumination were the most often validated for the high performance. Regarding active behavior (e.g., walking), lower performance of tools was reported. Also, tools used for physical condition (e.g., body condition scoring) and health evaluation (e.g., mastitis detection) were classified in lower performance group. The precision and accuracy of feeding and drinking assessment varied depending on measured trait and used sensor. Regarding relevance for animal-based welfare assessment, several validated technologies had application for good health (e.g., milk quality sensors) and good feeding (e.g., load cells, accelerometers). Accelerometers-based systems have also practical relevance to assess good housing. However, currently available PLF technologies have low potential to assess appropriate behavior of dairy cows. To increase actors' trust toward the PLF technology and prompt sensor-based welfare assessment, validation studies, especially in commercial herds, are needed. Future research should concentrate on developing and validating PLF technologies dedicated to the assessment of appropriate behavior and tools dedicated to monitoring the health and welfare in calves and heifers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease characterized by widespread loss of the pulmonary microcirculation and elevated pulmonary arterial pressures leading to pathological right ventricular remodeling and ultimately right heart failure. Regenerative cell therapies could potentially restore the effective lung microcirculation and provide a curative therapy for PAH. The objective of this systematic review was to compare the efficacy of regenerative cell therapies in preclinical models of PAH. METHODS: A systematic search strategy was developed and executed. We included preclinical animal studies using regenerative cell therapy in experimental models of PAH. Primary outcomes were right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP). The secondary outcome was right ventricle/left ventricle + septum weight ratio (RV/LV+S). Pooled effect sizes were undertaken using random effects inverse variance models. Risk of bias and publication bias were assessed. RESULTS: The systematic search yielded 1285 studies, of which 44 met eligibility criteria. Treatment with regenerative cell therapy was associated with decreased RVSP (SMD - 2.10; 95\% CI - 2.59 to - 1.60), mPAP (SMD - 2.16; 95\% CI - 2.97 to - 1.35), and RV/LV+S (SMD - 1.31, 95\% CI - 1.64 to - 0.97). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that cell modification resulted in greater reduction in RVSP. The effects on RVSP and mPAP remained statistically significant even after adjustment for publication bias. The majority of studies had an unclear risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Preclinical studies of regenerative cell therapy demonstrated efficacy in animal models of PAH; however, future studies should consider incorporating design elements to reduce the risk of bias.

A random effects model was used for estimating the global prevalence of chlamydial infections in birds and for all other meta-analyses. Subgroup meta-analysis was used to assess heterogeneity of the prevalence for the characteristics mentioned above. Meta-regression analysis and cumulative meta-analysis were used to determine the trend of the prevalence over time. The quality of each included study was also evaluated. Of 579 citations, 74 studies (a total of 39,225 bird samples from 26 countries, five continents) were included in meta-analysis. Almost all included studies reported birds with C. psittaci infections. The global prevalence of chlamydial infections in birds was 19.5 \% (95 \% CI, 16.3 \%-23.1 \%). No significant differences of the prevalence were observed among continents, the prevalence ranged from 16.5 \% (95 \% CI, 9.8 \%-26.5 \%) in South America to 21.7 \% (95 \% CI, 12.1 \%-35.9 \%) in North America. No significant differences of the prevalence were observed among bird orders, the prevalence ranged from 13.4 \% (95 \% CI, 7.0 \%-23.9 \%) in Passeriformes to 32.0 \% (95 \% CI, 20.6 \%-46.1 \%) in Galliformes. No significant differences of the prevalence were observed between specimen types; the prevalence was 18.4 \% (95 \% CI, 15.2 \%-22.2 \%) for live specimens and 26.3 \% (95 \% CI, 17.1 \%-38.1 \%) for carcass specimens. The prevalence was significantly higher in non-PCR techniques (29.5 \%, [95 \% CI, 22.4 \%-37.8 \%]) than in PCR techniques (15.3 \%, [95 \% CI, 12.1 \%-19.1 \%]). The cumulative evidence showed that the prevalence of chlamydial infections in birds has been relatively stable around 20 \% since 2012. This study indicates that the global prevalence of chlamydial infections in birds is quite high and all bird orders are potential sources for human psittacosis.},

	abstract = {Bacterial infection is a common wound complication that can significantly delay healing. Classical local therapies for infected wounds are expensive and are frequently ineffective. One alternative therapy is photodynamic therapy (PDT). We conducted a systematic review to clarify whether PDT is useful for bacteria-infected wounds in animal models. PubMed and Medline were searched for articles on PDT in infected skin wounds in animals. The language was limited to English. Nineteen articles met the inclusion criteria. The overall study methodological quality was moderate, with a low-moderate risk of bias. The animal models were mice and rats. The wounds were excisional, burn, and abrasion wounds. Wound size ranged from 6 mm in diameter to 1.5 × 1.5 cm(2) . Most studies inoculated the wounds with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Eleven and 17 studies showed that the PDT of infected wounds significantly decreased wound size and bacterial counts, respectively. Six, four, and two studies examined the effect of PDT on infected wound-cytokine levels, wound-healing time, and body weight, respectively. Most indicated that PDT had beneficial effects on these variables. PDT accelerated bacteria-infected wound healing in animals by promoting wound closure and killing bacteria.},

(2) Methods: A scoping review of peer-reviewed publications was performed and based on the guidelines set out in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews. (3) Results: The final set of publications consisted of 145 publications. Thirty-two viruses were identified in the publications and 50 African ungulates were reported/diagnosed with viral infections. Eighteen countries had viruses diagnosed in wild ungulates reported in the literature. (4) Conclusions: A comprehensive review identified several areas where little information was available and recommendations were made. It is recommended that governments and research institutions offer more funding to investigate and report viral diseases of greater clinical and zoonotic significance. A further recommendation is for appropriate One Health approaches to be adopted for investigating, controlling, managing and preventing diseases. Diseases which may threaten the conservation of certain wildlife species also require focused attention. In order to keep track of these diseases, it may be necessary to consider adding a "Wildlife disease and infection" category to the World Organisation for Animal Health-listed diseases.},

	abstract = {Background: Accumulative evidences on the beneficial effects of palm oil are progressively reported; however, there are still several controversies related to their effects on the risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This review explores the effects of palm oil and its liquid fraction namely palm olein, which is commonly used as cooking oil on four lipid parameters; total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), which play an important role as CVD-related biomarkers. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify the relevant studies on palm oil and the lipid parameters specifically focusing on the in-vivo animal model. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in Medline via EBSCOhost, Medline via OVID and Scopus. Studies were limited to the English language published between the years of 2000 and 2019. The main inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Study with in-vivo animal experiments [the animal should be limited to mammals] (2) Study should have evaluated the effects of palm oil or palm olein on plasma or serum lipid parameter (3) Study should have used palm oil or palm olein in the form of pure or refined oil (4) The treatment of palm oil or palm olein was assessed using the following outcomes: plasma or serum TC, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C concentration (5) Study should have control group and (6) studies on specific fatty acid, fraction enriched tocotrienol and tocopherol, crude palm oil, kernel oil, red palm oil, thermally oxidized palm oil, hydrogenated palm oil, and palm oil or palm olein based products namely margarine, palm milk, butter and cream were excluded. The quality and the risk of bias on the selected studies were assessed using the ARRIVE Guideline and SYRCLE's Risk of Bias tools, respectively. Results: The literature search successfully identified 17 potentially relevant articles, whereby nine of them met the inclusion criteria. All research articles included in this review were in vivo studies comprising seven rats, one hamster and one mice model. Conclusion: Significant positive outcomes were observed in several lipid parameters such as TC and LDL-C. The evidence from this review supported that palm oil and palm olein possess high potential as lipid-lowering agents.},

Learning studies in non-avian reptiles have greatly increased in the last 10 years providing an opportunity to test for sex-based learning using a meta-analysis. Although, we initially considered all reptiles, only lizard studies (N = 11) provided sufficient data to calculate effect sizes. We found weak evidence for sex-dependent learning and moderate heterogeneity in effect sizes across studies. Although, our hypothesized moderator variables (stimulus or task type, species, genus and family) explained little variation. Indeed, our results show that only one species (Egernia striolata) exhibited a sex-dependent learning difference, with males learning faster than females. Together, our meta-analysis indicated a general lack of effective reporting on attributes of study methodology (i.e., animal sex, sample sizes). We propose that future research improve reporting by openly sharing their data for the use in similar analyses. The limited sample currently constrains our ability to effectively disentangle whether sex differences vary across different tasks and stimuli. We urge authors to incorporate both sexes in experimental designs and test them on ecologically relevant cognitive assays to improve our understanding of the degree of sex differences in non-avian reptile learning.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The present systematic review attempted to determine the prevalence of Linguatula serrata (L. serrata) infection among Iranian livestock. The L. serrata known as tongue worm belongs to the phylum pentastomida and lives in upper respiratory system and nasal airways of carnivores. Herbivores and other ruminants are intermediate hosts. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library were searched from Nov 1996 to 22 Apr 2019 by searching terms including "Linguatula serrata", "linguatulosis", "pentastomida", "bovine", "cattle", "cow", "buffalo", "sheep", "ovine", "goat", "camel", "Iran", and "prevalence" alone or in combination. The search was conducted in Persian databases of Magiran, Iran doc, Barakatkns (Iran medex) and Scientific Information Database (SID) with the same keywords. After reviewing the full texts of 133 published studies, 50 studies had the eligibility criteria to enter our review. RESULTS: By random effects model analysis, the pooled prevalence of linguatulosis was 25\% (95\%CI: 18.0-33.0, I (2) = 98.67 \% , P {\textless} 0.001) in goats; 15.0\% (95\%CI: 10.0-20.0, I (2) = 97.95 \% , P {\textless} 0.001) in sheep; 12.0\% (95\%CI: 7.0-18.0, I (2) = 98.05 \% , P {\textless} 0.001) in cattle; 7\% (95\%CI: 2.0-16.0, I (2) = 97.52\%) in buffalos and 11.0\% (95\%CI: 6.0-16.0\%, I (2) = 96.26 \% , P {\textless} 0.001) in camels. The overall prevalence in livestock was estimated to be 25\%. The highest infection rate was recorded in West Azerbaijan Province (68\%) and the lowest rate was in Khuzestan Province (0.23\%) (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the high prevalence of L. serrata infection in livestock (mainly ovine linguatulosis) show the endemic status of linguatulosis in several parts of Iran and will pose a risk for inhabitants. Control strategies to reduce the parasite burden among these animals are needed.},

METHODS: EBSCO, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Embase Classic/Embase, and MEDLINE were searched using terms including "vitamins," "amino acids," "healing," "muscle," and "tendon." The primary search had 479 citations, of which 466 were excluded predominantly due to nonrandomized design. Randomized human and animal studies investigating all supplement types/forms of administration were included. Critical appraisal of internal validity was assessed using the Cochrane risk of Bias Tool or the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation Risk of Bias Tool for human and animal studies, respectively. Two reviewers performed duel data extraction. RESULTS: Twelve studies met criteria for inclusion: eight examined tendon healing and four examined muscle healing. All studies used animal models, except two human trials using a combined integrator. Narrative synthesis was performed via content analysis of demonstrated statistically significant effects and thematic analysis of proposed physiological mechanisms of intervention. Vitamin C/taurine demonstrated indirect effects on tendon healing through antioxidant activity. Vitamin A/glycine showed direct effects on extracellular matrix tissue synthesis. Vitamin E shows an antiproliferative influence on collagen deposition. Leucine directly influences signaling pathways to promote muscle protein synthesis. DISCUSSION: Preliminary evidence exists, demonstrating that vitamins and amino acids may facilitate multilevel changes in musculotendinous healing; however, recommendations on clinical utility should be made with caution. All animal studies and one human study showed high risk of bias with moderate interobserver agreement (k = 0.46). Currently, there is limited evidence to support the use of vitamins and amino acids for musculotendinous injury. Both high-quality animal experimentation of the proposed mechanisms confirming the physiological influence of supplementation and human studies evaluating effects on tissue morphology and biochemistry are required before practical application.},

Microsporidia infection demonstrated higher prevalence rates using microscopy 29.7 \% (19.7-42.2 \%), followed by serology and molecular techniques with 11 \% (4.6-24.2 \%) and 8.2 \% (5.9-11.4 \%), respectively. Moreover, molecular data showed Enterocytozoon bieneusi as the most dominant reported species with 7.4 \% (5.1-10.5 \%). Also, investigations (11 studies) mostly isolated D genotype among all E. bieneusi genotypes. These results highlight cats as a potential reservoir for acquisition of microsporidia infection in humans, and surveillance programs should be implemented in high-risk areas.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Co-infection of intestinal helminthic infections (IHIs) and tuberculosis (TB) has appeared as a public health issue, especially in developing countries. Some recent studies have been carried out on the possible relevance of IHIs to TB. The current systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the prevalence and odds ratio (OR) of IHIs among TB patients and clarify the relationship between IHIs and TB disease. METHODS: For the purpose of the study, five English databases including PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science (ISI), and Google scholar were searched (up to January 30, 2019) in order to find the related studies. Random-effects meta-analysis model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence, odds ratio (OR), and 95\% confidence interval (CI). Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. RESULTS: A total of 20 studies including 10 studies with case-control design (2217 patients and 2520 controls) and 10 studies with cross-sectional design (a total of 2415 participants) met the eligibility criteria. As shown by the random-effects model, the pooled prevalence of IHIs in TB patients was estimated to be 26\% (95\% CI, 17-35\%; 1249/4632). The risk of IHI was higher in TB patients compared to controls but this was not statistically significant. However, according to genus/species, the pooled OR of Strongyloides stercoralis (S. stercoralis) (OR, 2.68; 95\% CI, 1.59-4.54) had a significantly higher risk in TB patients compared to controls. Nevertheless, the results of random effects model showed no statistically significant association between overall pooled OR of IHIs in TB patients compared to controls in case-control studies (OR, 1; 95\% CI, 0-1). CONCLUSIONS: It is highly recommended that more precise studies should be carried out by researchers in order to better understand this association. Also, it is of great importance to include the periodic screenings for IHIs in the routine clinical care of these patients.},

	abstract = {Cryptosporidiosis, caused by the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium spp., is an important zoonotic disease and is considered a global public health concern. Dogs are suggested as one of potential reservoirs for transmitting the Cryptosporidium infection to humans. However, there is a paucity of information about global patterns of occurrence of Cryptosporidium in dogs. A systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out to evaluate the global prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection among dogs. In this study, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched for relevant studies up until October 30, 2019. Finally, 127 articles (including 160 datasets) were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection was estimated at 8\% (95 \% CI: 5-11 \%) using microscopic methods, 7\% (95 \% CI: 4-10\%) using coprogantigenic methods and 6\% (95 \% CI: 4-9\%) using molecular diagnostic methods. Molecular methods revealed that dogs were most frequently infected by C. canis (3.64 \%) and C. parvum (1.28 \%). The pooled prevalence different of subgroups (WHO regions, geographic and climate parameters, diagnostic methods, type of dog) were analyzed separately. The pooled odds ratio (OR) of Cryptosporidium was significantly higher than one for diarrhea status, with dogs suffering from diarrhea having a higher likelihood of Cryptosporidium infection, compared to dogs without diarrhea (OR; 3.61 95 \% CI: 1.89-6.90\%). The present study is the first systematic review and meta-analysis providing a comprehensive view of the global prevalence of Cryptosporidium in dogs and its related risk factors. Awareness of Cryptosporidium prevalence, risk factors, and disease complications for the health authorities, physicians, veterinarians and dog's owners is important for developing effective strategies to prevent infection.},

	abstract = {The One-Health approach implies that the health of people is connected to the health of animals and the environment. Rodents, which are abundant and widespread, have been considered the major reservoirs of Cryptosporidium infection in humans and other animals. However, there is a paucity of information about global patterns of occurrence of Cryptosporidium in rodents. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the pooled global prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection and associated risk factors in rodents. International databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google scholar) were systematically searched to identify relevant studies. A random-effects meta-analysis model was used to estimate the overall and the subgroup-pooled prevalence of Cryptosporidium across studies, and the variance between studies (heterogeneity) were quantified by I(2) index. The data were classified according to WHO-region, type of diagnostic methods, different kinds of rodents, and specific risk factors, including geographical and climate parameters. Eighty-four articles (including 92 datasets), from 29 countries met eligibility criteria for analysis. The pooled global prevalence (95\% CI) of Cryptosporidium infection in rodents was 17\% (13-20\%), being highest in North American and Caribbean regions 27\% (16-40\%) and lowest in South American 5\% (0-16\%) countries. Considering the detection methods, the pooled prevalence was estimated to be 25\% (13-39\%) using coproantigen detection methods, 17\% (13-23\%) using molecular detection methods, and 14\% (9-20\%) using microscopic detection methods. The highest prevalence of Cryptosporidium was found in muskrats 47\% (27-68\%), while Meriones persicus 1\% (0-3\%) had the lowest prevalence. These results emphasize the role of rodents as reservoir hosts for human-infecting Cryptosporidium. This highlights the need for an increased focus on implementing affordable, appropriate control programs to reduce the public health threat of cryptosporidiosis as a zoonosis of global importance.},

We carried out a systematic literature review on E. granulosus s.l. human and animal (cattle, sheep, dog) infection in European Mediterranean and Balkan countries in 2000-2019, to provide a picture of its recent epidemiology in this endemic area. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar and Open Grey databases were searched. Included cases were: i) for humans, data from hospital records and imaging studies; ii) for dogs, data from necropsy and coprological studies; iii) for ruminants, cases based on slaughter inspection. The NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) classification was used to categorize extracted data in epidemiological units, defined as data referred to one NUTS2 (basic region) in one year time. Data were then aggregated to NUTS1 level (major regions), calculating the average incidence value of included epidemiological units. For prevalence studies covering different epidemiological units, the pooled prevalence was estimated. Data were extracted from 79 publications, 25 on human infection (covering 437 epidemiological units), and 54 on animal infection (52 epidemiological units for cattle, 35 for sheep and 25 for dogs). At NUTS1 level, average annual incidence rates of human CE ranged from 0.10-7.74/100,000; pooled prevalence values ranged from 0.003-64.09\% in cattle, 0.004-68.73\% in sheep, and 0-31.86\% in dogs. Southern and insular Italy, central Spain, Romania and Bulgaria reported the highest values. Bovine data showed a more similar pattern to human data compared to sheep and dogs. Limitation of evidence included the paucity of human prevalence studies, data heterogeneity, and the patchy geographical coverage, with lack of data especially for the Balkans. Our results confirm Italy, Spain, and Eastern Europe being the most affected areas, but data are extremely heterogeneous, geographical coverage very patchy, and human prevalence studies extremely scant. Results also highlight the notorious problem of underreporting of E. granulosus s.l. infection in both humans and animals.},

Limitations of diagnostic tests and nonspecificity of symptoms have hampered the estimation of the global morbidity due to strongyloidiasis. This work aimed at assessing S. stercoralis-associated morbidity through a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available literature. MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, LILACS, and trial registries (WHO portal) were searched. The study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Odds ratios (ORs) of the association between symptoms and infection status and frequency of infection-associated symptoms were calculated. Six articles from five countries, including 6,014 individuals, were included in the meta-analysis-three were of low quality, one of high quality, and two of very high quality. Abdominal pain (OR 1.74 [CI 1.07-2.94]), diarrhea (OR 1.66 [CI 1.09-2.55]), and urticaria (OR 1.73 [CI 1.22-2.44]) were associated with infection. In 17 eligible studies, these symptoms were reported by a large proportion of the individuals with strongyloidiasis-abdominal pain by 53.1\% individuals, diarrhea by 41.6\%, and urticaria by 27.8\%. After removing the low-quality studies, urticaria remained the only symptom significantly associated with S. stercoralis infection (OR 1.42 [CI 1.24-1.61]). Limitations of evidence included the low number and quality of studies. Our findings especially highlight the appalling knowledge gap about clinical manifestations of this common yet neglected soil-transmitted helminthiasis. Further studies focusing on morbidity and risk factors for dissemination and mortality due to strongyloidiasis are absolutely needed to quantify the burden of S. stercoralis infection and inform public health policies.},

	abstract = {The objective of the study was to review current literature to determine whether the topical application of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) promotes healing in experimentally-induced full-thickness skin wounds in animals. The hypothesis was that the adjunct of PRP has a positive effect on wound healing. An electronic search was carried out on the following databases: Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Research Gate, Cochrane Wounds Group, Veterinary Information Network. No publication date nor language restrictions were applied. Randomised and not randomised controlled clinical trials comparing PRP with placebo or with other treatments were included. The reduction of open wound area in PRP-treated (test) wounds compared to control wounds was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were healing time and number of healed cases in test group compared to control. The following effect sizes were calculated: the Hedges' g for continuous variables; the odds ratio for binary data. Eighteen controlled clinical trials were included in the qualitative and quantitative synthesis, with a total of 661 wounds. All studies were published in the period 2007-2016. Eight studies were carried out on rodent/lagomorph mammals and 10 on non-rodent/lagomorph mammals. In all included studies, control wounds underwent placebo or were left untreated. The PRP group showed a better healing performance than the control group in each outcome. The effect size was statistically significant considering the primary outcome and the overall aggregation of the three outcomes. The effect size, although in favour of the treatment with PRP, was not significant considering the healing time and the number of healings. The overall heterogeneity was mild or moderate. Five studies reported a high risk of selection bias. The publication bias was always mild or absent. The results support the hypothesis of the positive effects of the PRP when compared to control groups in the treatment of experimentally-induced full-thickness skin wounds in animals. PRP can therefore be considered an effective adjunctive therapy in stimulating second intention healing of acute wounds in healthy animals.},

As we are entering the post-antibiotic era, there is a growing need for identifying alternatives to antibiotics for prevention and treatment. Although phytotherapeutic remedies are available and are used in Europe, evidence of their efficacy is currently very limited but is nevertheless still necessary. A systematic review of phytotherapy used for the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases in farm animals has been conducted using the PICOS approach. Analysis and extraction of information from studies was performed according to a protocol, and included: publication year and source, research body, species, farming system, purpose of application, disease in focus, diagnostic method, remedy used (origin and ingredients of the remedy), producer of remedy, way of administration, study design, and control groups, measure of effect, and outcome of the study. A total of 1,705 papers were screened, but only 44 (comprising 53 independent studies) met the inclusion criteria. The majority of the scientific studies identified show limitations in the study design as well as in presentation and standardization of the botanical remedies studied, which limits the possibilities of drawing firm conclusions. Preventive effect was investigated in 89\% of the studies. Half of the studies reported uncertain effects of the botanical remedies on subclinical measures in comparison to a control group. The review highlights unresolved questions such as the need for standardized controlled trials and for improved standardization of the botanical products by analytical methods, such as high-performance liquid chromatography. It is necessary to consider this in order to achieve replicable outcomes and establish efficacy and safety of phytotherapy in farm practice. The manageability of alternative medicine in farm animals also warrants further investigation so as to ascertain whether all necessary preconditions for their use are being granted.},

The median detectable hazard ratio was 0.3 for overall survival and 0.06 for disease progression. Progressive disease thresholds for studies that did not adopt VCOG-RECIST guidelines varied in stringency. Additionally, there was significant underreporting across all Cochrane risk of bias categories. The proportion of studies with unclear reporting ranged from 44\% (randomization) to 94\% (selective reporting). 72\% of studies also failed to define a primary outcome.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have previously reported, in a systematic review of 181 studies, that restriction of antibiotic use in food-producing animals is associated with a reduction in antibiotic-resistant bacterial isolates. While informative, that report did not concretely specify whether different types of restriction are associated with differential effectiveness in reducing resistance. We undertook a sub-analysis of the systematic review to address this question. METHODS: We created a classification scheme of different approaches to antibiotic restriction: (1) complete restriction; (2) single antibiotic-class restriction; (3) single antibiotic restriction; (4) all non-therapeutic use restriction; (5) growth promoter and prophylaxis restriction; (6) growth promoter restriction and (7) other/undetermined. All studies in the original systematic review that were amenable to meta-analysis were included into this substudy and coded by intervention type. Meta-analyses were conducted using random effects models, stratified by intervention type. RESULTS: A total of 127 studies were included. The most frequently studied intervention type was complete restriction (n=51), followed by restriction of non-therapeutic (n=33) and growth promoter (n=19) indications. None examined growth promoter and prophylaxis restrictions together. Three and seven studies examined single antibiotic-class and single antibiotic restrictions, respectively; these two intervention types were not significantly associated with reductions in antibiotic resistance. Though complete restrictions were associated with a 15\% reduction in antibiotic resistance, less prohibitive approaches also demonstrated reduction in antibiotic resistance of 9\%-30\%. CONCLUSION: Broad interventions that restrict global antibiotic use appear to be more effective in reducing antibiotic resistance compared with restrictions that narrowly target one specific antibiotic or antibiotic class. Importantly, interventions that allow for therapeutic antibiotic use appear similarly effective compared with those that restrict all uses of antibiotics, suggesting that complete bans are not necessary. These findings directly inform the creation of specific policies to restrict antibiotic use in food-producing animals.},

	abstract = {Pergolide, a dopamine agonist, is commonly administered to manage pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID), a progressive neurodegenerative disease prevalent in aged horses. However, available evidence regarding pergolide's efficacy in improving clinical and endocrine parameters is limited. The aim of this systematic review was to assess published literature and evaluate evidence regarding whether pergolide treatment results in improvement of clinical signs and/or adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) concentration compared to no treatment or other unlicensed treatments. Systematic searches of electronic databases were undertaken in April 2019, repeated in August and October 2019, and updated in July 2020. English language publications published prior to these dates were included. Screening, data extraction and quality assessment of publications was undertaken individually by the authors using predefined criteria and subsequently cross-checked. Modified critically appraised topic data collection forms were used to extract data. Due to marked between-study variations, meta-analysis was not undertaken. After removal of duplicate records; 612 publications were identified, of which 129 abstracts were screened for eligibility and 28 publications met criteria for inclusion in the review. Most studies were descriptive case series, cohort studies or non-randomised, uncontrolled field trials. Despite marked variation in study populations, case selection, diagnostic protocols, pergolide dose, follow-up period and outcome measures, in the vast majority of the included studies, pergolide was reported to provide overall clinical improvement in {\textgreater}75\% of cases. However, reported improvements in individual clinical signs varied widely. A reduction in plasma ACTH concentrations was reported in 44-74\% of cases, while normalisation to within reported reference intervals occurred in 28-74\% of cases.},

	abstract = {Measurement of basal adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) is currently used to diagnose pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) in horses, yet a systematic review of the evidence for its use has not been undertaken. This study aimed to systematically review evidence regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the basal ACTH diagnostic test. Electronic databases were systematically searched in January 2019, September 2020 and January 2021, for English language publications published prior to these dates. Screening, data extraction and quality assessment of publications was undertaken by the authors using predefined criteria. Study design, methodology and information reported in included studies were assessed using Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) checklists. Risk of bias and applicability were appraised using the Quality Assessment tool for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) quality assessment tool. Due to identified biases and marked between-study variations, meta-analysis was not undertaken. After removal of duplicates, 415 publications were identified, of which 25 were evaluated in full, with 11 of these meeting inclusion criteria. In most studies, basal ACTH was reported to have good sensitivity (overall median 75.5\%; interquartile range [IQR], 64.0-86.5\%; range, 36.0-100\%) and excellent specificity (overall median, 95.2\%; IQR, 84.2-98.9\%; range, 63.3-100\%). However, QUADAS-2 and STARD assessment highlighted that studies did not utilise optimal study design and/or study populations for the evaluation of a diagnostic test and the majority were subject to bias, or provided insufficient information to fully assess possible biases. Based on this review, basal ACTH performed better at ruling out PPID than detecting it.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate mathematical models that predict mineral excretion, particularly calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and selenium (Se), from lactating dairy cows. Mineral excretion can be affected by several dietary factors. A deficiency in Ca or Mg application to pasture, among other factors, can contribute to grass tetany or wheat pasture poisoning in cows, whereas an excess can cause runoff into water supplies. Manure application with high Se concentration can also result in runoff, causing the bioaccumulation of selenium in aquatic ecosystems, wetland habitats and estuaries, leading to toxic levels in fish. A database composed of studies relating to mineral utilisation in lactating dairy cows conducted after and including the year 2000 was compiled. A meta-analysis was conducted with the aim of creating multiple empirical equations to predict Ca, Mg and Se excretion from lactating dairy cows. Calcium intake, feed Ca content, milk yield, milk protein content and acid detergent fibre content in diet were positively and linearly related to Ca excretion. Dietary crude protein content and milk fat content were negatively related to Ca excretion. Magnesium intake, feed Mg content and milk yield were positively and linearly related to Mg excretion. Selenium content of diet and dry matter intake were linearly and positively related to Se excretion. Two sets of models were developed using or excluding the intake variable and both sets of models were evaluated with independent data originating from commercial herd or individual animals. In general, intake measurements improved prediction when evaluated with independent datasets (root mean square prediction error=8\% to 19\% vs 14\% to 26\% of the average observed value). There were substantial mean biases, particularly those evaluated with data from a commercial farm, perhaps due to inaccurate feed intake measurements. Although there was generally good agreement between predicted and observed mineral excretion, model development and evaluation would benefit from an expanded database.},

	abstract = {Regarding preparing and serving foods, food handlers have an influential role in the spreading of foodborne infections. Due to the great potential to cause foodborne infections, intestinal parasites (IPs) are considered a significant public health problem in today's societies. In Iran, despite several regional reports, national data on IPs prevalence in food handlers are lacking. The aim of the present study, therefore, is to estimate the pooled prevalence of IPs infections and associated pooled odds ratio of educational level among food handlers in Iran. PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar databases (international) and SID and Magiran databases (national) were systematically searched for studies that reporting the prevalence of IPs in food handlers in Iran, published between 2000 and 2020. Pooled prevalence was estimated using a random-effects model with a 95\% confidence interval (CI) and depicted as a forest plot, while heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochran's Q-test. The overall pooled prevalence estimate for IPs was 19.3\% (95\% CI = 14.9-23.7\%). Prevalence of the protozoan parasites (20\%, 95\% CI = 13.7-26.3\%) was significantly higher than that of the helminthic parasites (1.6\%, 95\% CI = 1.1-2.0\%). Giardia lamblia (5.2\%), Entamoeba coli (5.0\%), and Blastocystis spp. (4.4\%), as protozoan parasites, and Ascaris lumbricoides (1.4\%), Enterobius vermicularis (0.9\%), and Hymenolepis nana (0.5\%), as helminthic parasites, were the most commonly reported species. Food handlers with low educational levels were 20\% more exposed to IPs infection, compared to those with high educational levels (OR = 1.21, 95\% CI = 0.88 to 1.65). The prevalence of IPs infections among food handlers in Iran is significant. Besides taking into account this epidemiologic information, a holistic approach, including periodic stool screening, health education, and treatment of infected food handlers, will help in the control of these infections in Iran.},

Thus, the aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the seroprevalence of bovine brucellosis in Ethiopia. PubMed, Science Direct, African Journals Online, and Google Scholar were used to search the articles. All references were screened and articles, which reported seroprevalence of bovine brucellosis in Ethiopia were included in the study. Meta-analysis using random-effects models was made to calculate the pooled seroprevalence of brucellosis. This review included 15 papers. The estimated pooled seroprevalence of brucellosis was found to be 3.0\% (95\% CI: 2.0, 4.0). The subgroup analysis showed that there was a statistically significant association between the disease and geographical location, setting, laboratory technique employed and study years. Also, there was some evidence of publication bias (Egger's test, p = 0.0003) on studies reporting the prevalence of brucellosis in Ethiopia. This review proves a high seroprevalence of brucellosis in the country and appropriate control strategies are recommended. Moreover, further study on the risk factors is also required to develop cost-effective preventive strategies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Campylobacter and Salmonella, particularly non-typhoidal Salmonella, are important bacterial enteric pathogens of humans which are often carried asymptomatically in animal reservoirs. Bacterial foodborne infections, including those derived from meat, are associated with illness and death globally but the burden is disproportionately high in Africa. Commercial meat production is increasing and intensifying in many African countries, creating opportunities and threats for food safety. METHODS: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched six databases for English language studies published through June 2016, that reported Campylobacter or Salmonella carriage or infection prevalence in food animals and contamination prevalence in food animal products from African countries. A random effects meta-analysis and multivariable logistic regression were used to estimate the species-specific prevalence of Salmonella and Campylobacter and assess relationships between sample type and region and the detection or isolation of either pathogen. RESULTS: Seventy-three studies reporting Campylobacter and 187 studies reporting Salmonella across 27 African countries were represented. Adjusted prevalence calculations estimate Campylobacter detection in 37.7\% (95\% CI 31.6-44.3) of 11,828 poultry samples; 24.6\% (95\% CI 18.0-32.7) of 1975 pig samples; 17.8\% (95\% CI 12.6-24.5) of 2907 goat samples; 12.6\% (95\% CI 8.4-18.5) of 2382 sheep samples; and 12.3\% (95\% CI 9.5-15.8) of 6545 cattle samples. Salmonella were detected in 13.9\% (95\% CI 11.7-16.4) of 25,430 poultry samples; 13.1\% (95\% CI 9.3-18.3) of 5467 pig samples; 9.3\% (95\% CI 7.2-12.1) of 2988 camel samples; 5.3\% (95\% CI 4.0-6.8) of 72,292 cattle samples; 4.8\% (95\% CI 3.6-6.3) of 11,335 sheep samples; and 3.4\% (95\% CI 2.2-5.2) of 4904 goat samples. 'External' samples (e.g. hide, feathers) were significantly more likely to be contaminated by both pathogens than 'gut' (e.g. faeces, cloaca) while meat and organs were significantly less likely to be contaminated than gut samples. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated widespread prevalence of Campylobacter species and Salmonella serovars in African food animals and meat, particularly in samples of poultry and pig origin. Source attribution studies could help ascertain which food animals are contributing to human campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis and direct potential food safety interventions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Studies have shown that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has a beneficial effect in the treatment of spinal cord injury. A meta-analysis was used to study the effect of DHA on the neurological recovery in the rat spinal cord injury model, and the relationship between the recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury and the time and method of administration and the dose of DHA. DATA SOURCE: Published studies on the effect of DHA on spinal cord injury animal models from seven databases were searched from their inception to January 2019, including PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, VIP, and SinoMed databases. The search terms included "spinal cord injury" "docosahexaenoic acid", and "rats". DATA SELECTION: Studies that evaluated the influence of DHA in rat models of spinal cord injury for locomotor functional recovery were included. The intervention group included any form of DHA treatment and the control group included treatment with normal saline, vehicle solution or no treatment. The Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation's risk of bias assessment tool was used for the quality assessment of the included studies. Literature inclusion, quality evaluation and data extraction were performed by two researchers. Meta-analysis was then conducted on all studies that met the inclusion criteria. Statistical analysis was performed on the data using RevMan 5.1.2. software. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the score on the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale. Secondary outcome measures were the sloping plate test, balance beam test, stair test and grid exploration test. RESULTS: A total of 12 related studies were included, 3 of which were of higher quality and the remaining 9 were of lower quality. The highest mean Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale score occurred at 42 days after DHA treatment in spinal cord injury rats. At 21 days after treatment, the mean difference in Basso, Beattie, Bresnahan scores between the DHA group and the control group was the most significant (pooled MD = 4.14; 95\% CI = 3.58-4.70; P {\textless} 0.00001). In the subgroup analysis, improvement in the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale score was more significant in rats administered DHA intravenously (pooled MD = 2.74; 95\% CI = 1.41-4.07; P {\textless} 0.0001) and subcutaneously (pooled MD = 2.99; 95\% CI = 2.29-3.69; P {\textless} 0.00001) than in the groups administered DHA orally (pooled MD = 3.04; 95\% CI = -1.01 to 7.09; P = 0.14). Intravenous injection of DHA at 250 nmol/kg (pooled MD = 2.94; 95\% CI = 2.47-3.41; P {\textless} 0.00001] and 1000 nmol/kg [pooled MD = 3.60; 95\% CI = 2.66-4.54; P {\textless} 0.00001) significantly improved the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale score in rats and promoted the recovery of motor function. CONCLUSION: DHA can promote motor functional recovery after spinal cord injury in rats. The administration of DHA by intravenous or subcutaneous injection is more effective than oral administration of DHA. Intravenous injection of DHA at doses of 250 nmol/kg or 1000 nmol/kg is beneficial. Because of the small number and the low quality of the included studies, more high-quality research is needed in future to substantiate the results.},

Research involving animal models is indispensable to study the mechanisms of liver regeneration. Inaccurate reporting acts as a significant barrier during the correct interpretation of preclinical findings. Hence, we performed a systematic review to evaluate the status quo of the reporting standards and to assess the potential factors influencing reporting in animal studies, which are focusing on portal vein occlusion and/or associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged hepatectomy techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was performed in the PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases. Baseline study characteristics were recorded, and quality assessment was performed using the Animals in Research: Reporting in vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) checklist. RESULTS: A total of 107 research articles were included for the comprehensive assessment. In the subgroup analysis, newer reports and studies from the post-ARRIVE era, and reports from Europe were all associated with significantly higher ARRIVE scores (P {\textless} 0.05). Univariable regression analysis confirmed these factors as predictors of higher reporting quality. However, in the multivariable analysis, only publishing in the post-ARRIVE era has been found as single independent predictor of higher reporting standards (P = 0.028 post-ARRIVE total score 75th percentile; P = 0.000 post-ARRIVE total score median). CONCLUSIONS: Although an improving trend has been observed in reporting quality over the past years, this effect was clearly insufficient. Our results emphasize the need for further measures to improve the methodical quality at all levels of planning, execution, and reporting of preclinical studies in liver regeneration research.},

	abstract = {Probiotics have emerged as promising alternatives for improving resistance to diseases and stimulating growth of farmed shrimp. The aim of the present work was to assess the effect of probiotic addition on shrimp survival and growth performance through meta-analysis. PubMed, SciELO and Google Scholar search engines were searched for relevant studies published from 1980 to 2017 without language exclusion. We only selected the experiments from articles using penaeid shrimps without apparent disease, with the results published in peer-reviewed journals with any dispersion measure. Survival, specific growth rate (SGR) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were selected as outcomes. We evaluated experimental design, penaeid shrimp species, larval or postlarval stage, probiotic strain, modes of administration among others. A total of 100, 60 and 49 experiments were included to assess probiotic effects on survival, SGR and FCR, respectively. Probiotics increased survival compared to controls (SMD=3.068, 95\% CI 2.594 to 3.543) and improved SGR (SMD=3.811, 95\% CI 3.269 to 4.354) and FCR (SMD=-3.194, 95\% CI -3.469 to -2.920) in the pooled standardized mean difference random effect model, considering the source of heterogeneity and publication biases (i.e. where the decision to publish or not depends on the outcome of the experiment, e.g. withhold negative outcomes). Survival, SGR and FCR were improved in shrimps treated with probiotic. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a meta-analysis designed to investigate the effects of probiotics on shrimp survival and growth performance.},

	abstract = {1. Divergence in outcomes from studies on the effects of litter materials on body weight, feed intake, feed conversion and mortality in broilers has led to a need for a meta-analysis to quantify their effects.2. A systematic search of published quantitative research relating to wood shavings and alternative bedding litters was conducted using databases.3. Means, standard deviations and sample sizes were extracted from each study. The response variables were analysed using the standardised mean difference (SMD, control treatment minus alternative litters).4. The literature demonstrated that alternative materials have no impact on feed intake in broilers, compared to wood shavings (SMD = 0.064, 95\% CI = -0.101-0.229, P = 0.44).5. There was a positive overall effect of wood shavings on body weight (SMD = 0.253, 95\% CI = 0.073-0.433, P = 0.006), feed conversion (SMD = -0.169, 95\% CI = -0.327 - -0.012, P = 0.03) and mortality (SMD = -1.069, 95\% CI = -1.983 - -0.155, P = 0.02) of broilers, compared to other litter types.6. Subgroup meta-analysis revealed that straw, when used as an alternative litter material to wood shavings, may be responsible for lower body weight (SMD = 0.654, 95\% CI = 0.162-1.146, P = 0.009), worse feed conversion (SMD = -0.487, 95\% CI = -0.828 - -0.145, P = 0.005) and higher mortality rates of broilers (SMD = -3.25, 95\% CI = -5.681 - -0.819, P = 0.009). Rice husks impaired body weight compared to wood shavings (SMD = 0.535, 95\% CI = 0.065-1.004, P = 0.02).7. It was concluded that different litter types do not affect the broilers' feed intake. Conversely, broilers kept on straw showed lower body weights, worse feed conversion and higher mortality rates, in comparison to wood shavings. Rice husks decreased body weight compared to wood shavings.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The zoonotic parasite Taenia saginata transmits between humans, the definitive host (causing taeniosis), and bovines as the intermediate host (causing cysticercosis). Central and western Asia and the Caucasus have large cattle populations and beef consumption is widespread. However, an overview of the extent of human T. saginata infection and bovine cysticercosis is lacking. This review aims to summarize the distribution of T. saginata in this region. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted, that gathered published and grey literature, and official data concerning T. saginata taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis in central and western Asia and the Caucasus published between January 1st, 1990 and December 31st, 2018. Where no data were available for a country within this period, published data from 1985-1990 were also accessed. RESULTS: From 10,786 articles initially scanned, we retrieved 98 full-text articles from which data were extracted. In addition, two unpublished datasets were provided on the incidence of human taeniosis. Data for human taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis were found for all countries except Turkmenistan. Human taeniosis prevalence varied from undetected to over 5.3\%, with regional variations. Where bovine cysticercosis was detected, prevalences varied from case reports to 25\%. CONCLUSIONS: The public health burden of T. saginata is assumed to be small as the parasite is of low pathogenicity to humans. However, this review indicates that infection continues to be widespread and this may result in a large economic burden, due to the resources utilized in meat inspection and condemnation or processing with subsequent downgrading of infected carcasses.},

The terms "resveratrol" in combination with "retina", "retinal pathology", "diabetic retinopathy" and "eye" were searched. Possible biases were identified with the adopted SYRCLE's tool. Eighteen articles met inclusion/exclusion criteria for full-text review. Eleven of them included in vitro experiments, 11 studies reported in vivo data and 3 studies described both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Most of the in vivo studies did not include data that would allow exclusion of bias risks, according to SYRCLE's risk of bias tool. Both in vitro and in vivo data suggest anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative actions of resveratrol in models of diabetic retinopathy.

An inadequate supply of calcium during these stages can lead to unsuccessful reproduction or impaired offspring fitness. During reproduction, female mammals undergo numerous physiological changes, including adaptations to allow an adequate supply of calcium. The lack of quantitative studies analysing these physiological changes from a comparative perspective limits our ability to explain and understand these adaptations. Herein, we present our meta-analysis of studies reporting changes in bone turnover and calcium homeostasis during pregnancy and lactation in 14 species of mammals. Our meta-analysis of 60 studies showed that all species have a similar pattern of physiological changes during pregnancy and lactation, which include: (1) decreased serum calcium concentrations; (2) bone tissue loss; (3) decreased serum calcitonin and parathyroid hormone concentrations; and (4) increased serum calcitriol concentration, regardless of changes in parathyroid hormone concentrations. In addition, we found a negative relationship between: (1) serum calcium concentrations and the number of teats; and (2) serum parathyroid hormone concentrations and litter mass.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted to elucidate the factors affecting drinking water intake (DWI) in order to develop new DWI empricial predictive models for lactating dairy cows and to compare with existing models. A large dataset, containing 262 experimental diets from 75 experiments published in 65 peer-reviewed papers was built. Selected explanatory variables were grouped into animal (body weight (BW); BW$^{\textrm{0.75}}$; milk yield), diet composition (dry matter; ash; sodium; potassium; crude protein (CP); neutral detergent fiber), dry matter intake (DMI) and environment (mean air temperature and relative humidity) inputs. To develop the predictive models, the dataset (peer-reviewed papers) was randomly divided into two subsets for statistical analyses. The first data subset was used to develop equations to predict DWI (41 peer-reviewed papers; 47 experiments; 157 experimental diets), and the second data subset was used to assess the adequacy of the predictive models (24 peer-reviewed papers; 28 experiments; 105 experimental diets). Ash was the main diet input affecting DWI in lactating dairy cows, while BW$^{\textrm{0.75}}$ affected DWI more than milk yield. Use of dietary characteristics (DM, ash and CP) and DMI as inputs could be enough to predict DWI as accurately as more complete models. Dry matter intake as predictive variable does not improve DWI prediction in models with only animal (BW$^{\textrm{0.75}}$ and milk yield) as input, but it substantially improves prediction of models without use of animal as input. Among the existing models evaluated, those developed from just one experiment (Castle and Thomas, 1975; Little and Shaw, 1978; Murphy et al., 1983; Stockdale and King, 1983; Dahlborn et al., 1998) had poor prediction quality. We proposed the use of two models (diet II and animal+diet models) that presented the lowest root mean square prediction error (RMSPE) to predict DWI in lactating dairy cows.},

	abstract = {Dietary supplementation of pig diets with exogenous enzymes has been suggested as a strategy to increase nutrient digestibility and improve feed efficiency in grow-finisher pigs. However, inconsistent results are found in the literature. Ingredient composition of the diets is one of the most important sources of variation that may affect enzyme efficacy and consistency of results. A systematic review and a meta-analysis was therefore conducted to determine which exogenous enzymes with which diet type most consistently improve pig growth, nutrient digestibility and feed efficiency. Enzyme type and dietary cereal source were the main explanatory variables included in the models. The mean difference effects of enzyme supplementation on average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), gain to feed (G:F), apparent ileal digestibility (AiD) and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of dry matter (DM), crude protein (CP), and gross energy (GE) were calculated for each study and these were used as the effect size estimates in the meta-analysis. A dataset with 139 comparisons from 67 peer-reviewed publications was used in the meta-analysis. In response to enzyme supplementation, G:F was improved in 38 of the 120 comparisons reporting pig growth data, remained un-changed in 78 and deteriorated in 4. Overall, DM and GE AiD, and ATTD were improved by xylanase, xylanase+beta-glucanase, mannanase and protease dietary supplementation (P{\textless}0.05). Crude protein AiD was only improved by protease dietary supplementation (P{\textless}0.001). Dietary supplementation with xylanase alone improved ADG of maize - (P{\textless}0.05) and co-product - (P{\textless}0.05) based diets but had no effect on the G:F of grow-finisher pigs. Dietary supplementation with xylanase+beta-glucanase had no effect on ADG, ADFI and G:F. Protease supplementation tended to improve the ADG of grow-finisher pigs fed co-product-based diets (P=0.08) but had no effect on G:F. Dietary supplementation with multi-enzyme complexes improved the ADG (P{\textless}0.05) and G:F (P{\textless}0.01) of maize-, wheat-, barley- and co-product-based diets. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with all enzyme types improved nutrient digestibility depending on ingredient content, while mannanase and multi-enzyme complex supplementation most consistently improved growth and feed efficiency.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Consumption of lean fish and fish-derived proteins were effective for improving lipid profiles in published studies; however, evidence remains inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of lean fish or fish-derived protein on serum/plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels by conducting a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials (RCTs). DATA SOURCES: Medline (Ovid), Scopus, CINAHL, and Food and Nutritional Sciences databases were searched from the start date of each database to September 2019 to identify RCTs determining the effect of lean fish on lipid profile. STUDY SELECTION INCLUDED: RCTs investigated lean fish and fish-derived proteins intake and determined at least 1 major lipid or lipoprotein measurement. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently evaluated 1217 studies against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Relevant studies were assessed for risks of bias, and random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to generate average estimates of effect. RESULTS: A total of 24 studies met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of data from 18 to 21 eligible crossover and parallel-design RCTs with a total of 1392 to 1456 participants found triacylglycerol-lowering effects for lean fish compared with no fish consumption. Lean fish intake showed no significant differences related to total cholesterol or lipoprotein levels. Subanalysis showed that parallel-group RCTs tended to find greater reduction effects on circulating triacylglycerol than did crossover RCTs. CONCLUSION: Additional better-designed, longer, and larger RCTs, particularly crossover RCTs, are needed to clarify the impact of lean fish and fish proteins on the serum/plasma lipid profile. Findings from such studies would enable practitioners to provide their patients evidence-based recommendations to meet the American Heart Association guidelines for fish consumption to reduce cardiovascular disease risk.},

	abstract = {The global climate change brings about myriad of changes in the environment and ecosystem. The sea-level rise due to climate change results in salt-water intrusion into freshwater reservoirs of the coastal areas, increasing the salinity of the natural sources of potable water. People in the coastal areas consume saline water, exposing the intestinal tract to higher salt concentration on regular basis. This meta-analysis attempts to relate consumption of saline water to dysbiosis of rodent gut microbiome. Scientific reports were searched in PubMed/Medline, the Cochrane Library and Google Scholar. Original articles, abstracts and short communications were included depending on predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. A total of 8 original reports involving 124 rodents were included in this study. The pooled specificity and sensitivity of the reports were found to be 0.833 and 0.891 respectively by Meta Disc software v1.4. Pooled odds ratio and AUC were 20.056 and 0.896 respectively, implying a correlation between increased salt intake and gut microbiome dysbiosis (imbalance), measured from altered Firmicutes: Bacteroidetes ratio. Microbiome dysbiosis makes the intestine prone to enteric diseases. The outcomes of this meta-analysis indicates the dependence of mammalian gut microbiome on the amount of salt ingested, a condition aggravated by the global climate change and therefore necessitates similar studies on human populations living on coastal areas.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medicinal plants have been used traditionally since centuries for wound care and treatment of skin diseases both in human and animals. Skin diseases are one of the most common reasons for owners to take their dog to the veterinarian. The demands for treatment and prophylaxis of these diseases are broad. A wide range of bacteria including antibiotic-resistant bacteria can be involved, making the treatment challenging and bear an anthropo-zoonotic potential. The aim of this review is to systematically evaluate based on recent scientific literature, the potential of four medicinal plants to enrich the therapeutic options in pyoderma, canine atopic dermatitis, otitis externa, wounds and dermatophytosis in dogs. RESULTS: Based on four books and a survey among veterinarians specialized in phytotherapy, four medicinal plants were chosen as the subject of this systematic review: Calendula officinalis L. (Marigold), Hypericum perforatum L. agg. (St. John's Wort), Matricaria chamomilla L. (syn. Matricaria recutita L., Chamomile) and Salvia officinalis L. (Sage). According to the PRISMA statement through literature research on two online databases a total of 8295 publications was screened and narrowed down to a final 138 publications for which full-text documents were analyzed for its content resulting in a total of 145 references (21 clinical, 24 in vivo and 100 in vitro references). CONCLUSIONS: All four plants were proven to have antibacterial and antifungal effects of a rather broad spectrum including antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This makes them an interesting new option for the treatment of pyoderma, otitis externa, infected wounds and dermatophytosis. Marigold, St. John's Wort and Chamomile showed wound-healing properties and are thus promising candidates in line to fill the therapeutic gap in canine wound-healing agents. St. John's Wort and Chamomile also showed anti-inflammatory and other beneficial effects on healthy skin. Due to the wide range of beneficial effects of these medicinal plants, they should be taken into account for the treatment of dermatologic diseases in dogs at least in future clinical research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Taenia solium and Taenia saginata are food-borne parasites of global importance. In eastern Europe only fragmented information is available on the epidemiology of these zoonotic parasites in humans and animal populations. In particular for T. solium, on-going transmission is suspected. The aim of this systematic review was to collect the available data and describe the current knowledge on the epidemiology of T. solium and T. saginata in eastern Europe. METHODS: Literature published in international databases from 1990 to 2017 was systematically reviewed. Furthermore, local sources and unpublished data from national databases were retrieved from local eastern European experts. The study area included 22 countries. RESULTS: Researchers from 18 out of the 22 countries provided data from local and unpublished sources, while no contacts could be established with researchers from Belarus, Kosovo, Malta and Ukraine. Taeniosis and human cysticercosis cases were reported in 14 and 15 out of the 22 countries, respectively. Estonia, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Lithuania, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia reported cases of porcine cysticercosis. Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, and Ukraine reported bovine cysticercosis. CONCLUSIONS: There is indication that taeniosis and cysticercosis are present across eastern Europe but information on the occurrence of T. solium and T. saginata across the region remains incomplete. Available data are scarce and species identification is in most cases absent. Given the public health impact of T. solium and the potential economic and trade implications due to T. saginata, notification of taeniosis and human cysticercosis should be implemented and surveillance and notification systems in animals should be improved.},

	doi = {10.15167/2421-4248/jpmh2019.60.2.891},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Trichinellosis is a worldwide zooantroponosis caused by a nematode of the genus Trichinella that can pose a risk to human health. Among the species of Trichinella, T. Spiralis is the most common represented. The main source of human infection is the consumption of raw or undercooked meat (especially from pigs, wild boars and horses). Infection with Trichinella was one of the most frequent parasitic diseases in Italy until 1959 when obligatory screening for these parasites in slaughtered swines was introduced. As the last review on this topic was performed in 1989, the aim of our study was to describe the epidemiology of Trichinellosis in Italy from 1989 to 2017. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a systematic research in Pubmed (MEDLINE). METHODS: We included in our review studies that were published in the peer reviewed literature using the MESH terms "Trichinellosis" and "Italy". The only restrictions were the language (articles should be in English, Italian, Spanish or French) and the date of publication: from 1989 to March 2017. We excluded all the articles which referred to trichinellosis in the animals or which focused only on molecular biology of trichinella or on diagnostic techniques. RESULTS: We found 56 studies, but only 8 were considered eligible. During the study period, 764 cases of Trichinellosis occurred in Italy: 13.7\% caused by T. Britovi and 84.4\% by T. spiralis; in 14 cases the identification of the parasite was not performed. The outbreaks occurred in Umbria, Piedmont, Apulia (500 cases in 1990, by T. spiralis), Basilicata, Tuscany, Abruzzo, Emilia Romagna, Sardinia. In 2001 and in 2008 two outbreaks occurred in Lazio and Veneto respectively, but imported from abroad. The most important sources of infections were: horse meat (82.2\%); wild boar meat (11.9\%); pig meat (5.9\%). CONCLUSIONS: Trichinellosis is still present in Italy, but often forgotten by general practitioners and infectious diseases specialists. It's pivotal to improve awareness about this parasitic disease in Physicians and veterinarians. A strict surveillance, especially on meat products from endemic countries or from wild animals is necessary to considerably reduce the risk of acquiring the infection.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The multifactorial nature of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is the reason why complementary and alternative methods of treatment are sought in order to support the classic approach. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of Equine-Assisted Activities and Therapies (EAAT) in ASD patients based on a review of the literature. METHODS: A review of the literature and a meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PUBMED, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and PEDro databases were searched until July 20, 2017. Only articles published in English, in a journal with a review process, after 1999, with a control group or presentation of comparative pre-/post-therapy results in ASD patients, and clear inclusion/exclusion criteria were considered. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies (QATQS).The meta-analysis of three studies was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies with 390 participants (aged: 3-16 years) were included. The interaction between psychosocial functioning and EAAT was investigated in most studies. Improvement was reported in the following domains: socialization, engagement, maladaptive behaviors, and shorter reaction time in problem-solving situations after EAAT. The meta-analysis revealed no statistically significant differences for the investigated effects. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the need for further, more standardized research, the results of the studies included in this review allow us to conclude that EAAT may be a useful form of therapy in children with ASD.},

	abstract = {AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess the effects of the available coating methods against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) biofilm development on titanium implants. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases until May 18, 2019, for studies that used animal models of infections to evaluate various titanium implant coating methods to prevent S. aureus infection. Twenty-seven studies were eligible for inclusion in qualitative synthesis. Of those, twenty-three were considered in pair-wise meta-analysis. In addition, subgroup analysis of implant protection strategies relative to uncoated controls was performed, and any adverse events stemming from the coating applications were reported. Quality assessment was performed using SYRCLE's risk of bias tool for animal studies. RESULTS: Meta-analysis showed that active coating with antibiotics was favoured over uncoated controls (standardised mean differences [SMD] for MRSA and MSSA were - 2.71 [95\% CI, - 4.24 to - 1.18], p = 0.0005, and - 2.5 [- 3.79 to - 1.22], p = 0.0001, respectively). Likewise, large effect sizes were demonstrated when a combination of active and conventional non-degradable passive coatings was compared with controls (SMDs for MRSA and MSSA were - 0.62 [95\% CI, - 1.15 to - 0.08], p = 0.02, and - 1.93 [95\% CI, - 2.87 to - 0.98], p {\textless} 0.001, respectively). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: As a standalone prevention method, active titanium coating with antibiotics yielded promising results against both MSSA and MRSA. Combinations between active and non-degradable passive coatings, potentially allowing for sustained antimicrobial substance release, provided consistent hardware infection protection. Thus, we recommend that future research efforts focus on combined coating modalities against S. aureus biofilm infections in the presence of titanium implants.

To assess the potential of various prevention strategies against Staphylococcus-induced stainless steel-associated infections, a review of animal evidence was designed. The databases of PubMed, Embase, and CENTRAL were searched until March 10, 2020, for articles including animal models with stainless steel instrumentation and techniques to prevent Staphylococcus infection. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis of standardized mean differences (SMD) with subgroup analysis linked to various protection strategies and we recorded complications. Quality was assessed with the SYRCLE's risk of bias tool. Twenty-five studies were included. Combined active coating (featuring organic antibacterial compound release) and degradable passive finishing (lipid- or polymer-based structure modification reducing bacterial adhesion) was favored over untreated controls (SMDs for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus [MSSA] and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] were -3.46, 95\% CI [-4.53 to -2.4], p {\textless} .001 [n = 4 head-to-head comparisons]; and -6.67, 95\% CI [-10.53 to -3], p {\textless} .001 [n = 5 head-to-head comparisons], respectively). Systemic vitamin D supplementation and systemic antibiotic administration with or without local antibiotics demonstrated favorable outcomes against MSSA infection. On the contrary, no benefit was seen following vaccination. Of note, no side effects were documented. On the basis of data gathered from eight studies, which comprised 294 animals, a bioresorbable polymer- or lipid-based surface modification supplemented with organic coating yielded improved infection-related outcomes against MSSA and MRSA stainless steel infections, and therefore, this strategy could be further investigated in human research.},

	abstract = {Background: There has been increased concern about the suitability of CO(2) as a method for euthanasia of laboratory mice and rats, including the potential discomfort, pain or distress that animals may experience prior to loss of consciousness; time to loss of consciousness; best methods for use of CO(2); and the availability of better alternatives. These discussions have been useful in providing new information, but have resulted in significant confusion regarding the acceptability of CO(2) for rodent euthanasia. In some cases, researchers and veterinarians have become uncertain as to which techniques to recommend or use for euthanasia of laboratory mice and rats. Methods: The International Association of Colleges of Laboratory Animal Medicine (IACLAM) convened a taskforce to examine the evidence for adverse welfare indicators in laboratory rats and mice undergoing CO(2) euthanasia using a SYRCLE-registered systematic review protocol. Of 3,772 papers identified through a database search (PubMed, Web of Science, CAB Direct, Agricola, and grey literature) from 1900 to 2017, 37 studies were identified for detailed review (some including more than one species or age group), including 15 in adult mice, 21 in adult rats, and 5 in neonates of both species. Experiments or reports were excluded if they only assessed parameters other than those directly affecting animal welfare during CO(2) induction and/or euthanasia. Results: Study design and outcome measures were highly variable and there was an unclear to high risk of bias in many of the published studies. Changes in the outcome measures evaluated were inconsistent or poorly differentiated. It is likely that repeated exposures to carbon dioxide inhalation are aversive to adult rats and mice, based on avoidance behavior studies; however, this effect is largely indistinguishable from aversion induced by repeated exposures to other inhalant anesthetic gasses. Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence to permit an unbiased assessment of the effect of CO(2) inhalation during euthanasia on welfare indicators in laboratory mice and rats. Additional well-designed, unbiased, and adequately powered studies are needed to accurately assess the welfare of laboratory mice and rats undergoing euthanasia via CO(2) gas.},

Recent evidence has shown controversial results with regard to the role of dairy products in deleterious processes such as inflammation. The increasing number of studies on the anti- and proinflammatory effects of milk and dairy products in the past 5 y reflects the growing interest in this area of research. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the scientific evidence provided in the past 5 y on the effects of milk and dairy products on inflammatory biomarkers provided by randomized clinical trials. The search strategy was conducted in Medline (via PubMed) and Scopus (which includes EMBASE and the Web of Science) databases and included articles from 1 January 2012 to 30 April 2018. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane methodology. The number of study participants, type of study, doses, and the key results are reported. The following primary outcomes were considered for inclusion: circulating concentrations of C-reactive protein, interleukins, cytokines, and vascular adhesion molecules or expression of proinflammatory genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells; however, the primary outcomes considered were not limited to these. Sixteen studies (15 articles) included in this systematic review reported on healthy individuals and subjects who were overweight or obese and who had metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes. The consumption of milk or dairy products did not show a proinflammatory effect in healthy subjects or individuals with metabolic abnormalities. The majority of studies documented a significant anti-inflammatory effect in both healthy and metabolically abnormal subjects, although not all the articles were of high quality.

	abstract = {Human alveolar echinococcosis (AE), caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis, is one of the most dangerous zoonoses in the Northern hemisphere. In Europe, the parasite's life cycle is sylvatic, involving small rodents as intermediate hosts and red foxes as the major definitive hosts. Given the severity of this disease in humans and the high levels of environmental contamination with E. multilocularis in endemic areas, it seems crucial to implement control measures in order to prevent human AE. This systematic review identifies previous anthelmintic control programs targeting E. multilocularis in wild and domestic carnivores and evaluates the effectiveness of the different strategies implemented. A search through six databases identified 302 scientific papers for the period 1950-2015, of which only 17 were retained according to the inclusion criteria set. These 17 papers focused on control of E. multilocularis by baiting foxes in highly endemic areas of Europe or Japan, with the exception of one study focused on dogs in Alaska. The papers highlighted differences in baiting types, baiting frequency, choice of control areas and length of treatment period. Overall, these studies resulted in a sharp and statistically significant decrease in parasite prevalence, confirmed by the absence of overlap between confidence intervals for the pooled risk differences of control and treated areas. A monthly baiting frequency was proven to be highly effective at decreasing E. multilocularis prevalence in foxes, even in highly endemic areas and in a short period of time. Nevertheless, when foxes were not fully dewormed, the parasite showed a strong capacity to rapidly recover its initial prevalence. The fox baiting approach appears to be the most useful method for controlling the sylvatic life cycle of E. multilocularis, but it require a cost/benefit analysis before it is likely to be accepted by stakeholders.},

	abstract = {Consumption of specific fatty acids (FA) that are synthesized in the mammary gland, namely de novo FA, has implications for human health. The objective of the present meta-analysis was to study the associations between milk fat content of de novo FA, with (1) diet composition, and (2) milk production and composition. Milk FA data from 96 peer-reviewed studies published between 1990 and 2016 that included 324 treatment means from 83 bovine experiments, 36 treatment means from 12 caprine experiments, and 40 treatment means from 12 ovine experiments were used in this analysis. Individual species models including the fixed effect of experiment were fitted using multiple regression to explain milk content of de novo FA as a function of diet composition and milk production and composition variables. We also evaluated replacing the effect of the experiment by the effect of the experiment nested in the laboratory at which the research had been conducted, and the effect of the laboratory. Butyric acid content in milk fat was positively but weakly related to dietary ether extract in does and ewes. Lauric, myristic, and palmitic acid contents in milk fat were negatively related to dietary ether extract in does and to a somewhat lesser extent in cows and ewes. The results confirm that the inclusion of lipids in the diet may not only affect the availability of preformed FA but also the profile of FA synthesized de novo in the mammary gland. Most of the variation in all prediction models was explained by the experiment or by the laboratory if the latter was included in the model. The ample variation in analytical methods reported by the different research groups suggests that differences in analytical protocols might explain a substantial proportion of the variation in de novo FA profile. A main conclusion of this study is the potential influence of differences in analytical procedures to explain the variation in de novo FA profile. Standardization of methods of FA analysis to improve reproducibility seems to be an aspect of importance to this area of research.},

Molds and their toxins have attracted much attention worldwide due to the important economic losses related to their effects on human health and domestic and international trade. Although more than 400 mycotoxins have been identified, most studies have focused on aflatoxins, ochratoxin A, fusarium toxins, zearalenone, patulin, and trichothecenes owing to their relationships with food safety and economic losses. In Turkey, the dramatic variations in climatic conditions among regions have facilitated the spread of various foodborne mycotoxins. Accordingly, in this systematic review, a summary of the occurrence and contamination levels of foodborne mycotoxins in Turkey was provided. Based on the literature review, mycotoxin levels were shown to exceed the limits designated by the European Union in apple juice (35\%), milk (21\%), dairy products (12\%), dried fruits and vegetables (11\%), herbs (10\%), cereal and cereal products (2\%), nuts (1\%), and feeds (1\%). Thus, there is a need for additional studies on the mycotoxin prevalence in all types of foods and feeds throughout Turkey, and education programs on mycotoxin management are important for reducing the prevalence of mycotoxin contamination.},

	abstract = {Aquaculture is currently one of the best prospects to help meet the growing need for protein in the human diet. However, aquaculture development and production result in consequences for the environment and also impact other productive activities. Salmon and trout cage culture has required the use of large quantities of pharmaceuticals in order to control outbreaks and the persistence of different pathogens, including sea lice (parasitic copepods), which cause economic losses of around 0.39 € Kg(-1) of salmon produced. The pharmaceuticals currently used for the control of sea lice (cypermethrin, deltamethrin, azamethiphos, hydrogen peroxide) are applied by in situ immersion treatments, enclosing net pens using tarpaulin and then bathing fish with the pharmaceutical. After treatment the pharmaceuticals are released into the surrounding environment, exposing non-target species. Although the effects of such pharmaceutical exposure has been studied in some species, to date a systematic and exhaustive review of these potential effects has not yet been performed. In this study, an exhaustive review of the literature evaluating lethal and sub-lethal effects of anti-sea lice pharmaceuticals on non-target crustaceans and bivalves was performed, in order to assess the extent of the effects, toxicity, variables affecting such toxicity and identify potential synergistic effects previously unexplored. Our results show clear negative effects at concentrations lower than those used in treatments against sea lice in all of the species studied. Likewise, this study demonstrates knowledge gaps that need to be addressed in order to improve our understanding of the effects of these pharmaceuticals on non-target species, ecosystems in general and other productive activities.},

Only original articles and case reports published in indexed journals and under peer review processes were considered, then filtered by title, abstract and full text. Subsequently, the reference lists of the definitive articles were searched for additional information (snowballing). Eight definitive articles were considered for the presentation of results and discussion (seven published in English and one in Spanish, between 1993 and 2019). From the information collected in the eight studies, it can be inferred that the response to treatment depends on the underlying disease, but that when a more chronic process occurs, it is difficult for the patient to respond to the management protocol, since bronchiectasis has no cure, and it is only possible, from the treatment, to delay its progression.},

	abstract = {Learning anatomy traditionally has depended on traditional techniques like human cadaveric dissection and the use of textbooks. As technology advances at an ever-rapid speed, there are revolutionary ways to learn anatomy. A number of technologies, techniques and methodologies are utilised in anatomical education, but ones specifically receiving a lot of interest and traction is that of augmented reality and virtual reality. Although there has been a surge in interest in the use of these technologies, the literature is sparse in terms of its evaluation as to the effectiveness of such tools. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine in greater detail the literature specifically to see what the best practice in this field could be. By undertaking a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched for articles in both Web of Science and PubMed. Using the terms "augmented reality and teaching anatomy" yielded 88 articles. We then used "virtual reality and teaching anatomy" which resulted in 200 articles. We examined these articles, including that on augmented reality and virtual reality used to teach anatomy to undergraduate and postgraduate students, residents, dentistry, nursing and veterinary students. Articles were excluded if they were systematic reviews, literature reviews, review articles, news articles, articles not written in English and any literature that presented how a virtual model was created without the evidence of students testing it. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for virtual reality were the same as augmented reality. In addition, we examined the articles to identify if they contained data which was quantitative, qualitative or both. The articles were further separated into those which were pro, neutral or against for the use of these digital technologies. Of the 288 articles, duplicate articles totalling 67 were removed and 134 articles were excluded according to our exclusion criteria. Of the 31 articles related to augmented reality, 30 were pro, one neutral and no articles against the use of this technology. Fifty-six articles related to virtual reality were categorised resulted in 45 pro, eight neutral and three against the use of this technology. Overall, the results indicate most articles identified related to both virtual and augmented reality were for the use of those technologies, than neutral or against. This systemic review highlights the recent advances of both augmented reality and virtual reality to implementing the technology into the anatomy course.},

We examine reports of diverse species in various settings responding to changes in their environments that are occurring because of the pandemic.We searched the scholarly literature, preprints, and online news sources using combinations of the search terms 'tourism', 'animals', 'wildlife', 'coronavirus', and 'COVID-19'. We searched Web of Science, SCOPUS, EBSCOHost, JSTOR, bioRxiv, OSFPREPRINTS, GDELT, Google News, and National Public Radio, and analysed a total of 39 news articles, one peer-reviewed article, and six preprints.In total, we identified 92 distinct animal reports representing 48 mammal species. We used an existing tourism classification schema to categorise each article based on the situation reported, with the new addition of one context. We classified 92 separate animal reports in 46 articles into four (of six possible) contexts: mammals as attractions (n = 40 animal reports), mammals as commodities (n = 33), mammals as threats (n = 2), and unusual sightings of mammals (n = 17). Shortage of food, in danger of losing home, having an enriched/relaxed environment, spatial expansion, disease transmission, and poaching are the major impacts or events reported in these contexts.We suggest changes for each context with respect to how people interface with mammals, with the goal of improving the lives of mammals and the people dependent on them.},

However, in the literature, different positivity classifications/scoring were used in the evaluation of HER-2 status, and there is no consensus in terms of scoring of HER-2 expression in canine mammary tumors. In this study, it was aimed to estimate the HER-2 positivity rate by evaluating the results of the study using different positivity classifications by meta-analysis. In this context, by using "HER-2 canine mammary tumor" keywords, Pubmed and Web of Science electronic databases were scanned until February 2019, and a total of 97 related studies were found. However, 20 of these studies were used for the analysis. Two different meta-analyses were performed to evaluate the HER-2 positivity status with "2+ and 3+" and "3+" scores. As a result, HER-2 positivity rates were determined at 25.87\% and 25.99\% for the studies using "2+/3+" scores and "3+" respectively for HER-2 positivity.

METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed by using the Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Open Grey databases. A hand search of the reference lists of identified articles was also performed. Two reviewers critically assessed the studies for eligibility against inclusion and exclusion criteria and performed data extraction. Evaluation of the risk of bias of the studies was performed. RESULTS: A total of 48 studies were assessed for eligibility. Of these, 20 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the systematic review. All studies had a medium or high risk of bias. Although the majority of the studies reported that the use of root canal sealers increased the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth, conflicting evidence was found for the reinforcing effect of resin, glass ionomer, and calcium silicate-based sealers while there was moderate evidence for zinc oxide eugenol-based sealers in favor of no reinforcing effect. CONCLUSION: On the basis of available evidence, the use of root canal sealer increases the fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth. However, included studies presented considerable risk of bias. Regarding the comparisons among the sealers, no conclusions could be drawn for the superiority of one sealer type to another. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A considerable heterogeneity was found in the methodologies of included studies. Therefore, this review strongly suggests the development of standardized methods to test the reinforcement effect of root canal filling materials in in vitro studies.},

Therefore, this systematic and meta-analytic study was conducted to determine the prevalence of cystic echinococcosis in slaughtered livestock in Iran. METHODS: The present study was conducted as a systematic review and meta-analysis. The SID \& Magiran, MEDLINE (PubMed), ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were searched with a view to selecting relevant research works. As a result, 31 articles published from April 1970 to April 2020 were selected. The heterogeneity of the studies was assessed using the I(2) index. Data analysis was conducted within the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (CMA) v.3.0 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA) and Arc map (ArcGIS 10.3) software. RESULTS: The heterogeneity of the studies was evaluated using the I(2) test which value was 99\% showing a high heterogeneity in the studies. The results of publication bias in studies were evaluated by the Egger test, which were not statistically significant (P = 0.144). The overall prevalence of cystic echinococcosis in slaughtered livestock in Iran is 13.9\% (95\%CI: 10.7-17.7\%). The results of the meta-regression analysis indicate the increasing trend of the hydatid cyst prevalence with the increase of sample size and publication year (P {\textless} 0.05). CONCLUSION: According to the results of this study and the relatively high prevalence of cystic echinococcosis in slaughtered livestock in Iran, health policy makers should make effective decisions in this regard, and implement careful inspections and interventions by experts and health authorities.},

	abstract = {Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease. Despite ongoing improvements in the initial surgical repair, there are lingering concerns regarding the long-term outcomes that may be complicated by right ventricular dysfunction, right ventricular dyssynchrony, and sudden cardiac death. The mechanisms leading to these late complications remain incompletely understood. Experimental animal models have been developed as preclinical steps to gain better insight into the pathophysiology of diseases and to develop new therapeutic strategies. This article summarizes the various types of experimental animal models of repaired tetralogy of Fallot published to date in the literature, with the aim of achieving a greater understanding of the deleterious mechanisms that may lead to these known late and sometimes lethal complications. In addition to analysing the type of animals that can be used according to a given study's objectives, needs, and constraints, the present review also evaluates the type of dysfunction that can be reproduced in our model according to the research objectives, as well as the different types of studies in which these models can be used. In view of all that, we propose a decision algorithm to create an animal model of repaired tetralogy of Fallot. This synthesis should furthermore help in the development of future studies and in the design of new experimental models, thus allowing greater insight into this disease, while not forgetting the ultimate goal of broadening future therapeutic measures to reduce the morbidity and mortality of this prevalent congenital heart disease.},

The search terms were "leishmaniasis" AND "risk factors" using Google Scholar, PudMed, and Scielo. We reviewed 177 articles, 95 studies for VL, 75 for CL, and 7 on both forms. We identified 14 categories of risk factors which were divided into three groups: socioeconomic (7), environmental (5), and climate (2) variables. Socioeconomic factors were also associated with disease incidence in vulnerable human populations of arid and tropical developing regions. Environmental and climate factors showed significant associations with the incidence of VL and CL in all the studies that considered them. Proximity to natural vegetation remnants increased disease risk in both the New and Old World while the climate conditions favorable for disease transmission differed among regions. We propose a common conceptual framework for both clinical forms that highlights networks of interaction among risk factors. In both clinical forms, the interplay of these factors played a major role in disease incidence. Although there are similarities in environmental and socioeconomic conditions that mediate the transmission cycle of tropical, arid, and Mediterranean regions, the behavior of vector and reservoirs in each region is different. Special attention should be given to the possibility of vector adaptation to urban environments in developing countries where populations with low socioeconomic status are particularly vulnerable to the disease.},

Success in the clinic is nevertheless still limited, due to unfavourable biodistribution and poor cellular uptake of AONs. Extensive research is currently being conducted into the formulation of AONs to improve delivery, but thus far there is no consensus on which of those strategies will be the most effective. This systematic review was designed to answer in an unbiased manner which delivery strategies most strongly enhance the efficacy of AONs in animal models of heritable neurodegenerative and neuromuscular diseases. In total, 95 primary studies met the predefined inclusion criteria. Study characteristics and data on biodistribution and toxicity were extracted and reporting quality and risk of bias were assessed. Twenty studies were eligible for meta-analysis. We found that even though the use of delivery systems provides an advantage over naked AONs, it is not yet possible to select the most promising strategies. Importantly, standardisation of experimental procedures is warranted in order to reach conclusions about the most efficient delivery strategies. Our best practice guidelines for future experiments serve as a step in that direction.},

To evaluate and/or predict the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of scabies interventions, disease transmission modelling can be used. OBJECTIVE: To review published scabies models and data to inform the design of a comprehensive scabies transmission modelling framework to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of scabies interventions. METHODS: Systematic literature search in PubMed, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library identified scabies studies published since the year 2000. Selected papers included modelling studies and studies on the life cycle of scabies mites, patient quality of life and resource use. Reference lists of reviews were used to identify any papers missed through the search strategy. Strengths and limitations of identified scabies models were evaluated and used to design a modelling framework. Potential model inputs were identified and discussed. FINDINGS: Four scabies models were published: a Markov decision tree, two compartmental models, and an agent-based, network-dependent Monte Carlo model. None of the models specifically addressed crusted scabies, which is associated with high morbidity, mortality, and increased transmission. There is a lack of reliable, comprehensive information about scabies biology and the impact this disease has on patients and society. DISCUSSION: Clinicians and health economists working in the field of scabies are encouraged to use the current review to inform disease transmission modelling and economic evaluations on interventions against scabies.},

This systematic review summarizes the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes after ACS therapy in animal models. METHODS: An electronic search strategy incorporating MeSH and keywords was performed using all known literature databases and in accordance with PRISMA guidance (PROSPERO CRD42019119663). RESULTS: Of the 669 studies identified, eventually 64 were included. The majority of studies utilized dexamethasone at relative high dosages and primarily involved rodents. There was a high risk of bias, mostly due to lack of randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding. The main outcomes reported on was neuropathological, particularly glucocorticoid receptor expression and neuron densities, and neurobehavior. Overall there was an upregulation of glucocorticoid receptors with lower neuron densities and a dysregulation of the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. This coincided with various adverse neurobehavioral outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In animal models, ACSs consistently lead to deleterious long-term neurocognitive effects. This may be due to the specific agents, i.e., dexamethasone, or the repetitive/higher total dosing used. ACS administration varied significantly between studies and there was a high risk of bias. Future research should be standardized in well-characterized models.},

	abstract = {Large carnivores are persecuted globally because they threaten human industries and livelihoods. How this conflict is managed has consequences for the conservation of large carnivores and biodiversity more broadly. Mitigating human-predator conflict should be evidence-based and accommodate people's values while protecting carnivores. Despite much research into human and large-carnivore coexistence strategies, there have been few attempts to document the success of conflict-mitigation strategies on a global scale. We conducted a meta-analysis of global research on conflict mitigation related to large carnivores and humans. We focused on conflicts that arise from the threat large carnivores pose to livestock. We first used structured and unstructured searching to identify replicated studies that used before-after or control-impact design to measure change in livestock loss as a result of implementing a management intervention. We then extracted relevant data from these studies to calculate an overall effect size for each intervention type. Research effort and focus varied among continents and aligned with the histories and cultures that shaped livestock production and attitudes toward carnivores. Livestock guardian animals most effectively reduced livestock losses. Lethal control was the second most effective control, although its success varied the most, and guardian animals and lethal control did not differ significantly. Financial incentives have promoted tolerance of large carnivores in some settings and reduced retaliatory killings. We suggest coexistence strategies be location-specific, incorporate cultural values and environmental conditions, and be designed such that return on financial investment can be evaluated. Improved monitoring of mitigation measures is urgently required to promote effective evidence-based policy.},

A reference check and quality assessment were performed. RESULTS: A total of 32 articles were included. TBI patients with DAI had a favourable outcome in 62\%. The risk of unfavourable outcome in TBI with DAI was three times higher than in TBI without DAI. Odds ratio (OR) for unfavourable outcome was 2.9 per increase of DAI grade on MRI. Lesions located in the corpus callosum were associated with an unfavourable outcome. Other specific lesion locations and lesions count showed inconsistent results regarding outcome. Lesion volume was predictive for outcome only on apparent diffusion coefficient and fluid attenuation inversion recovery MRI sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of DAI on MRI in patients with TBI results in a higher chance of unfavourable outcome. With MRI grading, OR for unfavourable outcome increases threefold with every grade.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent experimental studies suggest that currently used anesthetics have neurotoxic effects on young animals. Clinical studies are increasingly publishing about the effects of anesthesia on the long-term outcome, providing contradictory results. The selective alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist dexmedetomidine has been suggested as an alternative nontoxic sedative agent. AIMS: The aim of this systematic review was to assess the potential neuroprotective and neurobehavioral effects of dexmedetomidine in young animals and children. METHODS: Systematic searches separately for preclinical and clinical studies were performed in Medline Ovid and Embase on February 14, 2018. RESULTS: The initial search found preclinical (n = 661) and clinical (n = 240) studies. A total of 20 preclinical studies were included. None of the clinical studies met the predefined eligibility criteria. Histologic injury by dexmedetomidine was evaluated in 11 studies, and was confirmed in three of these studies (caspase-3 activation or apoptosis). Decrease of injury caused by another anesthetic was evaluated in 16 studies and confirmed in 13 of these. Neurobehavioral tests were performed in seven out of the 20 studies. Of these seven rodent studies, three studies tested the effects of dexmedetomidine alone on neurobehavioral outcome in animals (younger than P21). All three studies found no negative effect of dexmedetomidine on the outcome. In six studies, outcome was evaluated when dexmedetomidine was administered following another anesthetic. Dexmedetomidine was found to lessen the negative effects of the anesthetic. CONCLUSION: In animals, dexmedetomidine was found not to induce histologic injury and to show a beneficial effect when administered with another anesthetic. No clinical results on the long-term effects in children have been identified yet.},

	abstract = {The therapeutic application of human-animal interaction has gained interest recently. One form this interest takes is the use of service dogs as complementary treatment for veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Many reports on the positive effect of PTSD Service Dogs (PSDs) on veterans exist, though most are indirect, anecdotal, or based on self-perceived welfare by veterans. They therefore only give a partial insight into PSD effect. To gain a more complete understanding of whether PSDs can be considered an effective complementary treatment for PTSD, a scoping literature review was performed on available studies of PSDs. The key search words were 'dog', 'canine', 'veteran', and 'PTSD'. This yielded 126 articles, of which 19 matched the inclusion criteria (six empirical studies). Recurrent themes in included articles were identified for discussion of methodology and/or results. It was found that results from most included studies were either applicable to human-animal interaction in general or other types of service animals. They therefore did not represent PSDs specifically. Studies which did discuss PSDs specifically only studied welfare experience in veterans, but used different methodologies. This lead us to conclude there is currently no undisputed empirical evidence that PSDs are an effective complementary treatment for veterans with PTSD other than reports on positive welfare experience. Additionally, the lack of development standardization and knowledge regarding welfare of PSDs creates risks for both human and animal welfare. It is therefore recommended that a study on the effect of PSDs be expanded to include evaluation methods besides self-perceived welfare of assisted humans. Future studies could include evaluations regarding human stress response and functioning, ideally conducted according to validated scientific methodologies using objective measurement techniques to identify the added value and mechanisms of using PSDs to assist treatment of PTSD in humans.},

	abstract = {Feather pecking (FP) is a significant issue in laying hens, which impacts societal acceptance of poultry farming, farm productivity, and bird welfare. Environmental enrichment-modifications of the environment to stimulate biological functioning and psychological well-being of animals-is one management strategy farmers can use to mitigate FP. However, inconsistent results of environmental enrichment are reported across studies questioning its value. A meta-analysis was used to determine the effect of environmental enrichment on FP and feather damage (FD) in laying hens. A systematic review of published literature from 4 databases resulted in 23 publications that met inclusion criteria. Feather pecking and FD outcomes were standardized between studies using different scoring systems. Driving variables included the presence of enrichment, production period when the enrichment started, housing type, beak trimming, bird strain, and age of the birds when FP and FD was measured. Considering the experiment as a random effect, linear mixed model analysis was used in a 2-step approach, whereby variables with a P {\textless} 0.30 in univariate analysis were included within the subsequent multivariate analysis. Variables with P {\textless} 0.05 in the multivariate analysis were retained in the final models. Model selection and evaluation were based on corrected Akaike information criteria, the root mean square prediction errors, and concordance correlation coefficients. A higher frequency of FP was observed in flocks lacking enrichment (P {\textless} 0.001), with increased age (P = 0.001), and in cage housing systems (P = 0.002). Similarly, FD increased in flocks lacking enrichment (P = 0.018), with increased age (P {\textless} 0.001), in the absence of beak trimming (P = 0.001) and in cage housing systems (P = 0.042). This meta-analysis confirmed the effectiveness of environmental enrichment in reducing FP and FD. Nevertheless, the modest ability of enrichment to dampen FD (-0.14 ± 0.06, 1-4 scale) suggests that other management strategies must be implemented in conjunction with environmental enrichment to successfully manage FP and resulting FD.},

	abstract = {Soybean meal and poultry offal meal are protein ingredients commonly used in the formulation of commercial diets for dogs. However, there remains great variability in the data on the digestibility of each protein source. This systematic review study aimed to examine the intake, apparent nutrient digestibility coefficients and fecal output of protein sources (soybean meal and poultry offal meal) in adult dog food as reported in published studies. The article search was conducted in August 2018 in the PUBMED, SciELO, Science Direct and AGRIS indexing databases. The literature search was performed using "digestibility", "source protein" and "dog" as the main key terms combined with sub-terms to broaden the scope of the search. Criteria were defined for readability, exclusion and inclusion of articles. Results were organized in groups according to the search in the indexing databases, totaling 1,414 articles. After the works were selected following the inclusion criteria, 17 articles were evaluated in this review. According to most studies, plant-based ingredients have a less variable nutritional composition than animal-derived ingredients and poultry offal meal increases the digestibility coefficients of nutrients and energy and reduces fecal dry matter production. Factors inherent to raw-material origin, ingredient and food processing, as well as the high heterogeneity of the methodologies evaluated in the studies are directly related to the obtained results. To ensure a more accurate evaluation of the quality and of effects on the digestibility of protein sources, we recommended that articles include ingredient processing data and that the variables be evaluated under standardized study conditions.},

Twenty-three peer-reviewed in vivo studies, comprising 50 trials, were identified between January 2010 and January 2017. The pDFA in these studies could be grouped in 5 classes: antimicrobial peptides, chitosan, lysozyme, medium chain fatty acids/ triglycerides and plant extracts. Mixed-effect meta-analyses with type of pDFA as fixed effect were performed for the growth parameters 'average daily gain' (ADG) and 'feed conversion ratio' (FCR), which are the two most important and used economic performance parameters for farmers. For each class of pDFA, results of the meta-analysis showed significantly higher average daily gain in the group with pDFA compared to the negative control group, while no significant difference with the positive control group was observed. Furthermore, a positive effect on FCR was found, i.e. significantly less feed was needed to gain 1 kg of body weight in the group with pDFA compared to the negative control group. No significant differences with positive control groups were observed for each class of pDFA, except for plant extracts, where the FCR was also significantly reduced in the treatment group. These results suggest that pDFA could reduce the use of antimicrobials without significant negative effects on performance indicators.},

	abstract = {A fracture-related infection (FRI) is an important complication that can lead to an increase in morbidity, mortality and economic costs. Preclinical in vivo models are critical in the evaluation of novel prevention and treatment strategies, yet it is important that these studies recapitulate the features of an FRI that make it such a clinical challenge. The aim of this systematic review was to survey the available preclinical models of FRIs and assess which of the key FRI-specific parameters are incorporated in these models. A comprehensive search was performed on July 1st 2017 in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science. Overall, 75 preclinical studies were identified, 97.3 \% (n = 73) of which use Staphylococcus aureus as the causative microorganism. The most common mode for creation of bone instability is an osteotomy (n = 30; 40 \%), followed by the creation of a defect (n = 26; 34.7 \%). An actual fracture is created in only 19 studies (25.3 \%). 12 (16 \%) of the models include a time gap between bacterial inoculation and fixation to mimic the time-to-treatment in clinical open fracture scenarios. This systematic review reveals that animal models used in translational research on prevention and treatment of FRIs rarely incorporate all key clinical features in one model and that there is an over-representation of S. aureus in comparison to actual clinical epidemiology. To improve the relevance of these studies, existing preclinical models should be adapted or new models developed that better recapitulate the clinical condition of FRI.},

	abstract = {Background: Social dominance status (e.g., dominant or subordinate) is often associated with individual differences in behavior and physiology but is largely neglected in experimental designs and statistical analysis plans in biomedical animal research. In fact, the extent to which social dominance status affects common experimental outcomes is virtually unknown. Given the pervasive use of laboratory mice and culminating evidence of issues with reproducibility, understanding the role of social dominance status on common behavioral measures used in research may be of paramount importance. Methods: To determine whether social dominance status-one facet of the social environment-contributes in a systematic way to standard measures of behavior in biomedical science, we conducted a systematic review of the existing literature searching the databases of PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Experiments were divided into several domains of behavior: exploration, anxiety, learned helplessness, cognition, social, and sensory behavior. Meta-analyses between experiments were conducted for the open field, elevated plus-maze, and Porsolt forced swim test. Results: Of the 696 publications identified, a total of 55 experiments from 20 published studies met our pre-specified criteria. Study characteristics and reported results were highly heterogeneous across studies. A systematic review and meta-analyses, where possible, with these studies revealed little evidence for systematic phenotypic differences between dominant and subordinate male mice. Conclusion: This finding contradicts the notion that social dominance status impacts behavior in significant ways, although the lack of an observed relationship may be attributable to study heterogeneity concerning strain, group-size, age, housing and husbandry conditions, and dominance assessment method. Therefore, further research considering these secondary sources of variation may be necessary to determine if social dominance generally impacts treatment effects in substantive ways.},

METHODS: We searched Medline, Web of Science, ProQuest and Google Scholar using PRISMA guidelines. Reference lists and grey literature were hand-searched. Meta-analyses were conducted in the R package 'metafor' using published odds ratios and 95\% confidence intervals. RESULTS: We identified 325 articles, from which we included 10 that described case-control studies. Four risk factors were statistically significant in the meta-analysis: eating undercooked poultry (OR=4.28, 95\%CI 3.09-5.93); eating poultry cooked outside the home (OR=2.13, 95\%CI 1.66-2.72); having pet chickens (OR=3.29, 95\%CI 2.12-5.10); and overseas travel (OR=5.55, 95\%CI 3.20-9.63). Among children, having pet dogs showed elevated but not significant risk (OR=1.57, 95\%CI 0.99-2.49). CONCLUSIONS: We identified consumption of chicken meat and contact with domestic chickens as important risk factors for campylobacteriosis in Australia and New Zealand. Implications for public health: While consumption of chicken meat is a well-known risk factor for campylobacteriosis, zoonotic transmission is often overlooked. This research indicates a greater need for public health awareness surrounding zoonotic campylobacteriosis, especially for young children.},

Seventeen studies were included in the analysis. Findings included the high performance of the Newton Nm1 microscope in the diagnosis of Plasmodium species, Schistosoma mansoni, and soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), exhibiting sensitivity and specificity values often greater than 90\%. Similarly, the CellScope was shown to have excellent diagnostic characteristics in the detection of Loa loa and Schistosoma species. Fluorescent microscopy was found to have high specificity and sensitivity in the diagnosis of Plasmodium species. Mobile phone technologies and handheld microscopes hold significant promise in the rapid and effective diagnosis of malaria and NTDs in areas where accurate diagnosis is vital.

The aim of this systematic review is to highlight the occupational exposure to bovine tuberculosis due to M. bovis. Methodology/Principal findings: A computer based literature search was carried out to identify papers published between January 2006 and March 2017. "PubMed, Cochrane Library and Science Direct" databases were searched systematically. Articles presenting the following properties were included: (i) focusing on M. bovis; (ii) concerning occupational exposure to bovine tuberculosis. A quality assessment was performed after selection of studies. Our search strategy identified a total of 3,264 papers of which 29 studies met the inclusion criteria. Of the 29 articles, 17 were cross-sectional studies (6 were of high quality and scored in the range of 6-7, 11 were of moderate quality and scored in the range 3-5), 10 were case reports, and 2 were reviews. Different occupational fields exposing to the disease were described: livestock sector, particularly in contact with dairy cattle (farmers, veterinaries and assistants, abattoir workers) and working in contact with wildlife (hunters, taxidermists). Conclusions: A specific guideline for occupational practitioners taking care of employees exposed to bovine tuberculosis is warranted and should be tailored to level of exposure. This review was intended to be the first step of such a project. Articles were identified from various continents and countries with different socio-economic situations, broadening our understanding of the worldwide situation. Published data on occupational exposure in developed countries are scarce. We had to extrapolate findings from countries with higher prevalence of the disease.},

	doi = {10.4103/1673-5374.266068},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Peripheral nerve repair is required after traumatic injury. This common condition represents a major public health problem worldwide. Recovery after nerve repair depends on several factors, including the severity of the injury, the nerve involved, and the surgeon's technical skills. Despite the precise microsurgical repair of nerve lesions, adequate functional recovery is not always achieved and, therefore, the regeneration process and surgical techniques are still being studied. Pre-clinical animal models are essential for this research and, for this reason, the focus of the present systematic review (according to the PRISMA statement) was to analyze the different animal models used in pre-clinical peripheral nerve repair studies. DATA SOURCES: Original articles, published in English from 2000 to 2018, were collected using the Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed databases. DATA SELECTION: Only preclinical trials on direct nerve repair were included in this review. The articles were evaluated by the first two authors, in accordance with predefined data fields. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes included functional motor abilities, daily activity and regeneration rate. Secondary outcomes included coaptation technique and animal model. RESULTS: This review yielded 267 articles, of which, after completion of the screening, 49 studies were analyzed. There were 1425 animals in those 49 studies, being rats, mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, cats and dogs the different pre-clinical models. The nerves used were classified into three groups: head and neck (11), forelimb (8) and hindlimb (30). The techniques used to perform the coaptation were: microsuture (46), glue (12), laser (8) and mechanical (2). The follow-up examinations were histology (43), electrophysiological analysis (24) and behavioral observation (22). CONCLUSION: The most widely used animal model in the study of peripheral nerve repair is the rat. Other animal models are also used but the cost-benefit of the rat model provides several strengths over the others. Suture techniques are currently the first option for nerve repair, but the use of glues, lasers and bioengineering materials is increasing. Hence, further research in this field is required to improve clinical practice.},

	abstract = {In humans, proof of long-term efficacy of ketamine treatment in neuropathic pain is lacking. To improve our understanding of ketamine behavior under various administration conditions, we performed a systematic review and meta-analyses of controlled studies on the efficacy of ketamine in mice and rats with a disease model of nerve injury on relief of allodynia. Searches in PubMed and EMBASE identified 31 unique studies. Four meta-analyses were conducted. The first analysis included 19 comparisons on a single ketamine dose and measurement of effect within 3 hours of dosing and showed an appreciable effect (standardized mean difference 1.6, 95\% confidence interval 1.1-2.1). Subgroup analyses showed no effect of species, administration route, or dose. A single administration was insufficient to sustain relief of allodynia at 24 or 72 hours after dosing, as observed in our second analysis (7 comparisons) with similar effects in ketamine-treated and control animals. Chronic ketamine administration (9 comparisons) caused profound relief of allodynia when tested during ketamine exposure (effect size 5.1, 3.7-6.5). The final analysis (6 comparisons) showed that chronic administration caused a slow loss of relief of allodynia with 70\% loss of effect 24 days after end of treatment. No subgroups analyses were possible in the last 3 meta-analyses due to small group sizes. These results indicate long-term ketamine anti-allodynic effects after chronic exposure ({\textgreater}3 days) but not after a single administration. Given several limitations, extrapolation of the animal data to the human condition is tenuous.},

	abstract = {Acute or degenerative meniscus tears are the most common knee lesions. Meniscectomy provides symptomatic relief and functional recovery only in the short- to mid-term follow-up but significantly increases the risk of osteoarthritis. For this reason, preserving the meniscus is key, although it remains a challenge. Allograft transplants present many disadvantages, so during the last 20 years preclinical and clinical research focused on developing and investigating meniscal scaffolds. The aim of this systematic review was to collect and evaluate all the available evidence on biosynthetic scaffolds for meniscus regeneration both in vivo and in clinical studies. Three databases were searched: 46 in vivo preclinical studies and 30 clinical ones were found. Sixteen natural, 15 synthetic, and 15 hybrid scaffolds were studied in vivo. Among them, only 2 were translated into clinic: the Collagen Meniscus Implant, used in 11 studies, and the polyurethane-based scaffold Actifit®, applied in 19 studies. Although positive outcomes were described in the short- to mid-term, the number of concurrent procedures and the lack of randomized trials are the major limitations of the available clinical literature. Few in vivo studies also combined the use of cells or growth factors, but these augmentation strategies have not been applied in the clinical practice yet. Current solutions offer a significant but incomplete clinical improvement, and the regeneration potential is still unsatisfactory. Building upon the overall positive results of these "old" technologies to address partial meniscal loss, further innovation is urgently needed in this field to provide patients better joint sparing treatment options.},

To overcome autograft disadvantages, the development of new scaffolds is constantly increasing, as well as the number of in vivo studies evaluating their osteoinductivity in ectopic sites. The aim of the present systematic review is to evaluate the last 10 years of osteoinduction in vivo studies. The review is focused on: (a) which type of animal model is most suitable for osteoinduction evaluation; (b) what are the most used types of scaffolds; (c) what kind of post-explant evaluation is most used. Through three websites (www.pubmed.com, www.webofknowledge.com and www.embase.com), 77 in vivo studies were included. Fifty-eight studies were conducted in small animal models (rodents) and 19 in animals of medium or large size (rabbits, dogs, goats, sheep, and minipigs). Despite the difficulty in establishing the most suitable animal model for osteoinductivity studies, small animals (in particular mice) are the most utilized. Intramuscular implantation is more frequent than subcutis, especially in large animals, and synthetic scaffolds (especially CaP ceramics) are preferred than natural ones, also in combination with cells and growth factors. Paraffin histology and histomorphometric evaluations are usually employed for postimplantation analyses.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: One of the major risk factors for OA is meniscectomy (Mx) that causes a rapid and progressive OA. Mx has been employed in various animal models, especially in large ones, to study preclinical safety and strategy effectiveness to counteract OA. The aim of the present study is to review in vivo studies, performed in sheep and published in the last ten years. METHODS: The search strategy was performed in three websites: www.scopus.com, www.pubmed.com, and www.webofknowledge.com, using "Meniscectomy and osteoarthritis in sheep" keywords. RESULTS: The 25 included studies performed unilateral total medial Mx (MMx), unilateral partial MMx, bilateral MMx, unilateral total lateral Mx (LMx), unilateral partial LMx, and bilateral LMx and MMx combined with anterior cruciate ligament transaction. The most frequently performed is the unilateral total MMx that increases changes in cartilage and subchondral bone more than the other techniques. Gross evaluations, histology, radiography, and biochemical tests are used to assess the degree of OA. The most widely tested treatments are related to scaffolds with or without mesenchymal stem cells. CONCLUSION: OA therapeutic strategies require the use of large animal models due to similarities with human joint anatomy. A protocol for future in vivo studies on post-traumatic OA is clarified.},

Today, no human cases of HPS have been reported in Mexico in spite of similar environmental conditions with Central America and the USA where several cases have occurred. To understand the current situation of hantaviruses in Mexico and the public health risk, a systematic review of studies was conducted reporting hantaviruses in rodents to known state seroprevalence and hantavirus genotypes. Simultaneously, this study identified the potential hantaviruses based on the phylogenetic diversity (PD) of hantaviruses reported in the Americas in hosts with the distribution in Mexico. A total 3862 rodents belonging to 82 species have been tested since 1999 to 2017. Overall, 392 individuals representing 43 rodent species were seropositive, and the seroprevalence ranged from 0 to 69.22\%. Seven hantaviruses genotypes have been described in Mexico and three are zoonotic. Four host species of rodents are widely distributed in Mexico harboring the highest PD of viruses. According to the hosts distribution, 16 genotypes could be circulating in Mexico and some of these represent a potential risk for public health. This study proposed multidisciplinary and interinstitutional collaborations to implement systematic surveillance in rodents.},

The database containing information on the effects heat stress has on the productive and reproductive performance of lactating sows was composed by 20 articles published in international journals from 2000 to 2016, totalizing 2222 lactating sows. The duration of lactation was corrected to 21d. In the studies analyzed, the most representative variables were piglet weight at 21 days (kg) and litter weight at 21 days (kg). Daily ambient temperature (T°C) ranged from 15.0° to 32.0 °C. Rectal temperature and respiratory rate were higher in lactating sows maintained in hot conditions compared to those maintained in the thermal comfort range. The nutrient intake by the lactating sows was inversely proportional to the ambient temperature. The piglets weaned of lactating sows were kept in thermal comfort 90.84 heavier percentage point after 21 days of the piglets of lactating sows kept in heat stress environment. Piglet weight gain exhibited a high and negative correlation with ambient temperature. At 1 °C above the thermal comfort range (from 15° to 25°C) leads to a decrease in food intake (kg/d) and milk yield (kg/d), which represents a high and negative correlation with at room temperature, that is, as the ambient temperature increases, there is less consumption of nutrients, resulting in reduced milk production (less mobilization of nutrients to the mammary gland). Increased respiratory rate is an efficient parameter for evaluating the intensity of heat stress in lactating sows.},

For this purpose, we performed a systematic search on PubMed and Scopus databases to retrieve original studies published until August 2016. Thirty-one studies were selected using Prisma strategy, which were then submitted to data extraction and methodological bias analysis. Half of the studies showed that the number of erythrogram decreased in infected animals, indicating anaemia. In 68.2\% of the studies, the total amount of leukogram values increased, suggesting infection. The main methodological limitations were insufficient information for T. cruzi strains identification, inoculation routes and parasitological characterization. Most of the mammalian species analysed showed the same pattern of haematological changes following T. cruzi infection, indicating that haematological parameters might direct the diagnosis of Chagas disease in the initial phase.},

Therefore, we developed a systematic review to analyse the main characteristics of the CNS lesions in non-human hosts infected. From a structured search on the PubMed/Medline and Scopus platforms, 32 studies were retrieved, subjected to data extraction and methodological bias analysis. Our results show that the most frequent alterations in the CNS are the presence of different forms of T. cruzi and intense lymphocytes infiltrates. The encephalon is the main target of T. cruzi, and inflammatory changes in the CNS are more frequent and severe in the acute phase of infection. The parasite's genotype and phenotype are associated with the tropism and severity of the CNS lesions. The methodological limitations found in the studies were divergences in inoculation pathways, under-reporting of animal age and weight, sample calculation strategies and histopathological characterization. Since the changes were dependent on the pathogenicity and virulence of the T. cruzi strains, the genotype and phenotype characterization of the parasite are extremely relevant to predict changes in the CNS and the neurological manifestations associated with Chagas' disease.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) infection is generally diagnosed through parasitological identification of microfilariae (mf) in the blood. Although historically the most commonly used technique for counting mf is the thick blood smear based on 20 µl blood (TBS20), various other techniques and blood volumes have been applied. It is therefore a challenge to compare mf prevalence estimates from different LF-survey data. Our objective was to standardise microfilaraemia (mf) prevalence estimates to TBS20 as the reference diagnostic technique. METHODS: We first performed a systematic review to identify studies reporting on comparative mf prevalence data as measured by more than one diagnostic test, including TBS20, on the same study population. Associations between mf prevalences based on different diagnostic techniques were quantified in terms of odds ratios (OR, with TBS20 blood as reference), using a meta-regression model. RESULTS: We identified 606 articles matching our search strategy and included 14 in our analyses. The OR of the mf prevalences as measured by the more sensitive counting chamber technique (≥ 50 µl blood) was 2.90 (95\% confidence interval (CI): 1.60-5.28). For membrane filtration (1 ml blood) the OR was 2.39 (95\% CI: 1.62-3.53), Knott's technique it was 1.54 (95\% CI: 0.72-3.29), and for TBS in ≥ 40 µl blood it was 1.37 (95\% CI: 0.81-2.30). CONCLUSIONS: We provided transformation factors to standardise mf prevalence estimates as detected by different diagnostic techniques to mf prevalence estimates as measured by TBS20. This will facilitate the use and comparison of more datasets in meta-analyses and geographic mapping initiatives across countries and over time.},

	abstract = {Canine and human bladder cancer present similar anatomical, morphological, and molecular characteristics, and dogs can be considered a model for human bladder cancer. However, the veterinary literature lacks information regarding cross-validation analysis between human and canine large-scale data. Therefore, this research aimed to perform a meta-analysis of the canine literature on bladder cancer, identifying genes and proteins previously evaluated in these studies. In addition, we also performed a cross-validation of the canine transcriptome data and the human data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify potential markers for both species. The meta-analysis was performed using the following indexing terms: "bladder" AND "carcinoma" AND "dog" in different international databases, and 385 manuscripts were identified in our initial search. Then, several inclusion criteria were applied, and only 25 studies met these criteria. Among these studies, five presented transcriptome data, and 20 evaluated only isolated genes or proteins. Regarding the studies involving isolated protein analysis, the HER-2 protein was the most studied (3/20), followed by TAG-72 (2/20), COX-2 (2/20), survivin (2/20), and CK7 (2/20), and the remaining nine studies evaluated one isolated protein each. Regarding the cross-validation analysis of human and canine transcriptome data, we identified 35 dysregulated genes, including ERBB2, TP53, EGFR, and E2F2. Our results demonstrate that the canine literature on bladder cancer previously focused on the evaluation of isolated markers with no association with patient survival. This limitation may be related to the lack of a homogenous protocol for treating patients and the lack of follow-up during treatment. In addition, the lack of information regarding tumor muscle invasion can be considered an important limitation when comparing human and canine bladder tumors. Our in silico analysis involving canine and human transcriptome data provided several genes with the potential to be markers for both human and canine bladder tumors, and these genes should be considered for future studies on canine bladder cancer.},

It is attracted by artificial light from urban and rural buildings, raising the risk of transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi. Despite the wide body of published information on P. geniculatus, many knowledge gaps exist about its biology and epidemiological potential. For this reason, we analysed the literature for P. geniculatus in Scopus, PubMed, Scielo, Google Scholar and the BibTriv3.0 databases to update existing knowledge and provide better information on its geographic distribution, life cycle, genetic diversity, evidence of intrusion and domiciliation, vector-related circulating discrete taxonomic units, possible role in oral T. cruzi transmission, and the effect of climate change on its biology and epidemiology.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lyme borreliosis, a tick-borne disease, is endemic to some parts of North America and is an emerging disease in other parts of the world. Vaccination is an increasingly common, although controversial, method used in the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs; the reported efficacies of Borrelia burgdorferi vaccines in dogs are highly variable, ranging from 50\% to 100\%. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of vaccines for prevention of Lyme disease in dogs in North America. METHODS: Experimental and observational study designs were eligible for inclusion. The outcome of interest was the reduction of incidence of clinical illness after exposure to B. burgdorferi. Electronic databases searched were MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Centre for Agricultural Biosciences Abstracts. Clinical signs were extracted as dichotomous outcomes: lameness, anorexia, pyrexia, depression, and lymphadenopathy. Study quality was assessed using tools from the Cochrane collaboration. RESULTS: In total, 3 observational studies and 13 challenge trials were included. None of the challenge trials assessed lymphadenopathy, but for each of the remaining 4 clinical signs, a meta-analysis was performed. Compared to unvaccinated dogs, vaccinated dogs had a reduced odds of developing lameness, depression, pyrexia, and anorexia (odds ratio: 0.15-0.23). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Based on the quantitative synthesis of results from challenge studies, vaccinated dogs are less likely to develop clinical signs after exposure to B. burgdorferi compared to unvaccinated dogs. These results should be interpreted with caution, however, as several shortcomings related to quality and study design were identified. Future studies should focus on larger sample sizes in field conditions.},

	abstract = {Honey has a history of medicinal use that predates written records. In recent decades, there has been renewed interest in the use of honey in human medicine, particularly for the treatment of burns and other wounds. Several recent systematic reviews in the human literature have demonstrated the efficacy of honey in the treatment of a number of conditions, including burns, wounds and oral mucositis. The goal of this scoping review was to describe the nature and extent of the current body of evidence addressing the medicinal use of natural honey and/or its derivatives in animals. Although the focus of this review was the veterinary literature, all animal species except insects and humans were eligible, including animals used for biomedical research. Electronic databases searched were MEDLINE, CAB Abstracts, AGRICOLA, Web of Science Core Collection, and Web of Science SciELO Citation Index. A total of 397 articles reporting 436 primary research studies were included in this review. The majority of the articles were biomedical research articles (n = 350); fewer veterinary research articles were identified (n = 47). Apart from one systematic review, all biomedical studies were challenge trials. Most veterinary studies were case reports/series (n = 23), followed by challenge trials (n = 18) and controlled trials (n = 8). The animal species examined within veterinary articles consisted primarily of dogs, horses, cats and cattle, whereas the majority of biomedical research articles examined rats and mice. Wound healing was the most common indication examined; other indications examined included the prevention or treatment of gastric ulcers, bacterial and parasitic infections, toxic exposures, metabolic conditions (e.g., diabetes) and neoplasia. The majority of interventions consisted of non-medical grade honey (n = 412/436), followed by medical-grade honey (n = 29/436) and derivatives of natural honey (n = 9/436). With much of the current veterinary literature consisting of case reports and case series, high-quality primary veterinary research in the form of controlled trials or challenge trials is needed to advance this field, as well as to provide sound data for evidence-based assessments of the efficacy of honey in clinical veterinary practise.},

	abstract = {Emerging viral infections represent a public health risk pointed out by the spreading of pathogens with potential zoonotic risk. Moreover, the risk of zoonosis has probably been underestimated in occupational settings. A literature review between 2007 and 2018 was performed to identify evidences concerning the epidemiological associations between some emerging viruses and occupational diseases. Observational studies and case-reports were selected and analyzed. West Nile Virus (WNV) disease, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) disease and Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection were included in the review for their potential zoonotic transmission. The most important risk factor for acquiring WNV infection and CCHF infection is the exposure to infected mosquitoes and ticks, respectively; therefore, outdoor workers are at risk of infection. HEV is responsible for epidemics and endemics of acute hepatitis in humans, that can become infected through waterborne, foodborne and zoonotic transmission routes. A total of 10, 34 and 45 eligible studies for WNV, CCHF virus (CCFHV) and HEV, respectively, were analyzed by year, country, study design, risk group and outcomes. The occupational risk groups mainly included farm and agricultural workers, veterinarians, slaughterers, animal handlers, healthcare workers and soldiers. These findings support the need to develop effective interventions to prevent transmission of emerging viruses.},

The goal of this scoping study was to ascertain trends in the publication of systematic reviews and meta-analyses examining animal health, animal performance, and on-farm food safety. Online databases were searched for reviews published between 1993 and 2018 that focused on relevant outcomes in domestic livestock, companion animals, or wildlife species. In total 1787 titles and abstracts underwent data characterization. Dairy cattle, fish, and pigs were the most common target commodity groups. Few articles investigated both health and performance outcomes (only health: n = 418; only performance: n = 701; both health and performance: n = 103). Most of the reviews (67.6\%, n = 1208/1787) described a meta-analysis but did not state in the title or abstract that a systematic review was also conducted, which is potentially problematic. Adherence to reporting guidelines is recommended for all systematic reviews and meta-analyses. For research areas with many reviews, an evidence repository is recommended. For less well-reviewed areas, additional investigation may be necessary to identify the reasons for the lack of synthesis research.},

Thirty-eight relevant reviews were identified. Quality assessment was based on the AMSTAR 2 framework for the critical appraisal of systematic reviews. The quality of most of the reviews captured was classified as critically low (84.2\%, n = 32/38), and only a small percentage of the evaluated reviews did not contain critical weaknesses (7.9\%, n = 3/38). Particularly, a small number of reviews reported the development of an a priori protocol (15.8\%, n = 6/38), and few reviews stated that key review steps were conducted in duplicate (study selection/screening: 26.3\%, n = 10/38; data extraction: 15.8\%, n = 6/38).

Our aim was to create evidence synthesis about the effects of electrical stimulation of DRG in the context of pain from in vitro and in vivo animal models, analyze methodology and quality of studies in the field. METHODS: For conducting systematic review we searched three data bases: MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science. The quality of included studies was assessed with the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation risk of bias tool for animal studies. The study was registered in the Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies data base. RESULTS: We included six in vitro and eight in vivo animal studies. All included in vitro studies combined neurostimulation with substances or drugs and reported an improvement in pain-related parameters due to neurostimulation. Among in vivo studies, six used pulsed radiofrequency, while two used electrical field stimulation. All in vivo studies reported improvement in pain-related behavior following stimulation. Meta-analysis was not possible because of heterogeneity and missing data. The quality of included studies was suboptimal since all had an unclear risk of bias in multiple domains. CONCLUSIONS: Limited data from in vitro and in vivo animal studies indicate that electrical stimulation of DRG has a positive therapeutic effect in the context of pain-related outcomes. Further studies with a standardized methodological approach and outcomes will provide useful information about electrical stimulation of DRG in animal models.},

We report on the first use of meta-analysis and a systematic review to analyze the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) in companion animals. Databases such as MedLib, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched. The information was extracted by two independent reviewers and the results were reviewed by a third. Two reviewers independently assessed the study protocol using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist and the study quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal checklist for prevalence data. OpenMeta analyst and comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) were used for the meta-analysis. The random effect model was used, and publication bias was assessed using the Eggers test and funnel plot. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed, and the sources were analyzed using the leave-one-out meta-analysis, subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Twenty-two studies met the eligibility criteria, but because some studies reported the prevalence of VRE in more than one companion animal, they were considered as individual studies, and 35 studies were therefore added to the final meta-analysis. Sampling period of the included studies was from 1995-2018. Of the 4288 isolates tested in the included studies, 1241 were VRE. The pooled prevalence of VRE in companion animals was estimated at 14.6\% (95\% CI; 8.7-23.5\%; I(2) = 97.10\%; p {\textless} 0.001). Between-study variability was high (t(2) = 2.859; heterogeneity I(2) = 97.10\% with heterogeneity chi-square (Q) = 1173.346, degrees of freedom (df) = 34, and p {\textless} 0.001). The funnel plot showed bias, which was confirmed by Eggers test (t-value = 3.97165; p = 0.00036), and estimates from the leave-one-out forest plot did not affect the pooled prevalence. Pooled prevalence of VRE in dogs and cats were 18.2\% (CI = 9.4-32.5\%) and 12.3\%, CI = 3.8-33.1\%), respectively. More studies were reported in Europe than in any other continent, with most studies using feces as the sample type and disc diffusion as the detection method.

	abstract = {A number of prion diseases affect humans, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; most of these are due to genetic mutations in the affected individual and occur sporadically, but some result from transmission of prion proteins from external sources. Of the known animal prion diseases, only bovine spongiform encephalopathy prions have been shown to be transmissible from animals to humans under non-experimental conditions. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a prion disease that affects cervids (e.g., deer and elk) in North America and isolated populations in Korea and Europe. Systematic review methodology was used to identify, select, critically appraise and analyse data from relevant research. Studies were evaluated for adherence to good conduct based on their study design following the Cochrane collaboration's approach to grading the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations (GRADE). Twenty-three studies were included after screening 800 citations from the literature search and evaluating 78 full papers. Studies examined the transmissibility of CWD prions to humans using epidemiological study design, in vitro and in vivo experiments. Five epidemiological studies, two studies on macaques and seven studies on humanized transgenic mice provided no evidence to support the possibility of transmission of CWD prions to humans. Ongoing surveillance in the United States and Canada has not documented CWD transmission to humans. However, two studies on squirrel monkeys provided evidence that transmission of CWD prions resulting in prion disease is possible in these monkeys under experimental conditions and seven in vitro experiments provided evidence that CWD prions can convert human prion protein to a misfolded state. Therefore, future discovery of CWD transmission to humans cannot be entirely ruled out on the basis of current studies, particularly in the light of possible decades-long incubation periods for CWD prions in humans. It would be prudent to continue CWD research and epidemiologic surveillance, exercise caution when handling potentially contaminated material and explore CWD management opportunities.},

Lack of sufficient research and endemic potential of the disease is posing serious threats to public health. The aim of this review was to explore the current status of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) related research and to identify knowledge gaps and the areas that are yet to be explored. An interpretative scoping review methodology was followed to systematically characterize the most recent literature. Literature survey was conducted using electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar. This comprehensive research yielded more than 300 records, but we excluded 100 articles based on our inclusion criteria and duplicates removal. All articles (n=85) that have been published currently were discussed in this scoping review. From a total of 303 documents retrieved, 85 met the criteria. All the documents (case studies, review articles, systematic reviews, meta-analysis, case control studies, cohort studies, randomised control trials, and longitudinal studies) were included in the study. The articles mainly cover different areas such as epidemiology, prevalence, diagnosis, pathogenesis, clinical outcomes, molecular basis, phylogenetics, transmission and treatment of CCHF. Treatment and prevention related knowledge is limited; therefore, future research should focus the development of therapeutics to mitigate the increasing risk of CCHF. Priority future goal should be studies on the molecular basis and treatment of CCHFV infection because several knowledge gaps have been identified in these areas.},

DESIGN: A comprehensive literature search and meta-analysis were conducted in which 22 studies (13 child, 9 adult) met inclusion criteria. Both intervention versus control and intervention pre-post effect sizes were computed using a random effects model. RESULTS: The overall intervention versus control effect size was large and significant (d = 1.65, 95\% CI = 0.46-2.832). Similarly, the pre-post effect size was large and significant (d = 2.19, 95\% CI = 0.74-3.64). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis indicate that AAI can yield large effects across a number of medically relevant outcomes. There is, however, substantial methodological variation across studies and more randomized clinical trials with stronger methodological controls are needed to establish the effectiveness of AAI compared to other interventions.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.envint.2017.12.032},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: An increasing number of reports suggest early life exposures result in adverse effects in offspring who were never directly exposed; this phenomenon is termed "transgenerational inheritance." Given concern for public health implications for potential effects of exposures transmitted to subsequent generations, it is critical to determine how widespread and robust this phenomenon is and to identify the range of exposures and possible outcomes. OBJECTIVES: This scoping report examines the evidence for transgenerational inheritance associated with exposure to a wide range of stressors in humans and animals to identify areas of consistency, uncertainty, data gaps, and to evaluate general risk of bias issues for the transgenerational study design. METHODS: A protocol was developed to collect and categorize the literature into a systematic evidence map for transgenerational inheritance by health effects, exposures, and evidence streams following the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) approach for conducting literature-based health assessments. RESULTS: A PubMed search yielded 63,758 unique records from which 257 relevant studies were identified and categorized into a systematic evidence map by evidence streams (46 human and 211 animal), broad health effect categories, and exposures. Data extracted from the individual studies are available in the Health Assessment Workspace Collaborative (HAWC) program. There are relatively few bodies of evidence where multiple studies evaluated the same exposure and the same or similar outcomes. Studies evaluated for risk of bias generally had multiple issues in design or conduct. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence mapping illustrated that risk of bias, few studies, and heterogeneity in exposures and endpoints examined present serious limitations to available bodies of evidence for assessing transgenerational effects. Targeted research is suggested to addressed inconsistencies and risk of bias issues identified, and thereby establish more robust bodies of evidence to critically assess transgenerational effects - particularly by adding data on exposure-outcome pairs where there is some evidence (i.e., reproductive, metabolic, and neurological effects).},

	abstract = {Severe hyperthermia, for example, classical heatstroke or exertional heatstroke from heatwaves or exercise respectively, or from drug ingestion or other non-infective pyrogens, is associated with a high mortality and morbidity, which may be chronic or permanent. Abolition of lipopolysaccharide, from gram-negative intestinal bacteria translocating into the systemic circulation via an intestinal wall rendered permeable from the hyperthermia, reduces the adverse effects, suggesting that antibiotics against the intestinal bacteria may have a similar effect. A systematic review searching Embase, MEDLINE and PubMed from the earliest date available until 2019 was conducted, according to PRISMA guidelines. Two papers were found which fit the criteria. In one, non-absorbable oral antibiotics were administered prior to the onset of heat stress, which reduced the cardiovascular dysfunction and rise in endotoxaemia, but animals succumbed at a lower temperature. In the second, non-absorbable oral antibiotics, in combination with a laxative and enema, given prior to the onset of heat stress, improved mortality; antibiotics administered after the heat stress did not, but the antibiotics used may have limited action against intestinal bacteria. Only two papers were found; both suggest an improvement in organ dysfunction or mortality after an episode of heat stress. No papers were found that investigate the sole use of antibiotics effective against intestinal bacteria given after the onset of heat stress, although biological plausibility suggest they warrant further research.},

Nonetheless, these data are highly fragmented, and a tool is required to integrate existing data and to provide a basis for data-driven decision making for IFM's safety. Therefore, meta-analysis and meta-regression were conducted to estimate the prevalence of foodborne pathogens in IFM and to determine factors influencing the estimated values. Using Africa as a case, searches were systematically made for published data and relevant grey literature. Data from 18 studies in 15 countries were analyzed. Staphylococcus aureus (37\%), pathogenic Escherichia coli (16\%), Listeria monocytogenes (6\%), and Salmonella spp. (3\%) were the most prevalent pathogens with a pooled prevalence estimate of 12\%. Heterogeneity among prevalence estimates was attributed to sampling point and microbial group but could be moderated by publication year, country cluster, and methods for microbial confirmation. The pooled prevalence estimates increased over time as more studies became available, whereby the odds were higher in studies from 2010 onwards than studies before 2010. From the analyses, S. aureus presented the greatest safety concern in African IFM. Future microbiological studies should take into consideration different IFM sampling points and advanced analytical methods to identify pathogens.},

	abstract = {Rabies is one of the major public health problems in China, and the mortality rate of rabies remains the highest among all notifiable infectious diseases. A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) vaccination rate and risk factors for human rabies in mainland China. The PubMed, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Science and Technology Periodical and Wanfang databases were searched for articles on rabies vaccination status (published between 2007 and 2017). In total, 10 174 human rabies cases from 136 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Approximately 97.2\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 95.1-98.7\%) of rabies cases occurred in rural areas and 72.6\% (95\% CI 70.0-75.1\%) occurred in farmers. Overall, the vaccination rate in the reported human rabies cases was 15.4\% (95\% CI 13.7-17.4\%). However, among vaccinated individuals, 85.5\% (95\% CI 79.8\%-83.4\%) did not complete the vaccination regimen. In a subgroup analysis, the PEP vaccination rate in the eastern region (18.8\%, 95\% CI 15.9-22.1\%) was higher than that in the western region (13.3\%, 95\% CI 11.1-15.8\%) and this rate decreased after 2007. Approximately 68.9\% (95\% CI 63.6-73.8\%) of rabies cases experienced category-III exposures, but their PEP vaccination rate was 27.0\% (95\% CI 14.4-44.9\%) and only 6.1\% (95\% CI 4.4-8.4\%) received rabies immunoglobulin. Together, these results suggested that the PEP vaccination rate among human rabies cases was low in mainland China. Therefore, standardised treatment and vaccination programs of dog bites need to be further strengthened, particularly in rural areas.},

We conducted a systematic review of 24 animal studies including 424 animals to evaluate the efficacy of AS-IV for diabetic nephropathy (DN); all current possible mechanisms were summarized. A search strategy was applied to eight databases from inception to June 2020. The CAMARADES 10-item quality checklist and Rev-Man 5.3 software were used to analyze the risks of bias of each study and data regarding outcome measures, respectively. The mean study quality score was 5.4 points (range 3-8 points). Meta-analyses data and comparisons between groups showed that AS-IV significantly slowed the progression of pathological signs in the kidney including glomeruli and tubules, increasing creatinine clearance rate, decreasing blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, 24-h urinary neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase, 24-h urinary albumin, 24-h urinary microalbumin and HbA1c. There were no significant differences between experimental and control groups with respect to mortality or levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. In terms of the possible mechanisms of treatment of DN, AS-IV acts through antifibrotic, antioxidant, and antiapoptotic mechanisms, thereby alleviating endoplasmic reticulum stress, inhibiting mitochondrial fission, and increasing autophagic activity. Taken together, our findings suggest that AS-IV is a multifaceted renoprotective candidate drug for DN.},

Standard mean difference along with 95\% confidence intervals was calculated to assess the strength of association through the random-effects model. Six published articles containing 1378 cattle samples were included in our meta-analysis. We found UASMS2 was not related to carcass weight, dressing percentage and loin muscle area in the recessive genetic model, but there was a significant association between UASMS2 and average daily weight gain, dry matter intake, body weight, marbling score, and backfat thickness. This meta-analysis indicated that UASMS2 was associated with growth and meat quality traits of cattle, implying that this SNP can be used reliably in beef cattle breeding.

Pooled analysis showed that the negative rates of serum anti-S. japonicum antibody were 45.36\% [95\% confidential interval (CI): (43.96\%, 46.76\%)] and 20.83\% [95\% CI: (19.69\%, 21.97\%)] detected by ELISA and IHA within 6 months post praziquantel treatment, 62.95\% [95\% CI: (61.59\%, 64.31\%)] and 55.61\% [95\% CI: (54.21\%, 57.01\%)] within 6 to 12 months after treatment and 85.92\% [95\% CI: (84.94\%, 86.90\%)] and 86.90\% [95\% CI: (85.95\%, 87.85\%)] over 12 months after treatment, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The negative rate of the serum anti-S. japonicum antibody by IHA and ELISA increased with the time of post-treatment with praziquantel. The overall negative rates of anti-S. japonicum antibody detected by IHA and ELISA are low within 12 months post praziquantel treatment. However, a high negative rate of anti-S. japonicum antibody is detected if there is no new contact with infested water after 12 months of praziquantel treatment.},

We aimed to conduct a systematic review on the studies using the TUS to modulate the brain functions and associated behavioral changes in both animals and humans. Methods: A literature search for published studies in the past 10 years was conducted. Two authors independently reviewed the relevant articles. Data were extracted and qualitatively summarized. Quality of studies was assessed by the SYRCLE's risk of bias tool for preclinical studies or the PEDro scale for clinical studies. Results: A total of 24 animal studies (506 animals) and 11 human studies (213 subjects) were included. Findings based on most animal studies demonstrated the excitatory or suppressive modulatory effects of ultrasonic stimulations on motor cortex, somatosensory cortex, thalamus, prefrontal cortex, auditory, and visual areas. Brain modulatory effects also were found among healthy human subjects in seven studies and two clinical studies suggested TUS may result in potential benefits on patients with disorder of consciousness or chronic pain. The safety concerns of TUS seem to be minor based on the human studies. Conclusions: TUS appears to be a viable technique in modulating the brain functions; however, research on TUS is still in its early stages, especially in human studies. Parameters need to be optimized before launching systematic investigations in humans.},

	abstract = {Neuropathic pain is defined as a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system, currently remaining a challenging condition to treat. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplantation is emerging as a promising strategy to alleviate the neuropathic pain conditions induced by peripheral nerve injury. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the efficacy and safety of MSCs transplantation in neuropathic pain induced by peripheral nerve injury in controlled animal studies, and thus to yield evidence-based decision making. Following the PRISMA guidelines, PubMed, Cochrane Central Library, Embase, and CINAHL were searched for preclinical controlled animal studies from the inception to April 16, 2020. Seventeen studies are included in this review. Substantial heterogeneity is observed regarding the animal's species, models of neuropathic pain, regimen of MSCs transplantation, and outcome of measures across the included studies. Both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia could be significantly attenuated by transplanted MSCs. The MSCs-elicited analgesic effect is independent of the type of MSCs, time of administration, and route of delivery, and is efficiently enhanced by genetic transfection with fibroblast growth factor, proenkephalin, and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. The migration of MSCs after intrathecal or intravenous injection has been shown to be directed toward the surface of dorsal spinal cord or dorsal root ganglions on the ipsilateral side of injury. No adverse effects have been reported. The accumulating evidence demonstrates the therapeutic effect of MSCs-based cell therapy on prevention and alleviation of the neuropathic pain induced by peripheral nerve injury in rat or mouse models. The robust preclinical studies are deserved to optimize the regimen of MSCs transplantation and to promote the translation of the MSCs-based therapy into clinical studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Animal models are well established for studying the effects of alkaloids in preventing myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, few studies have investigated the therapeutic effects of alkaloids in humans. This meta-analysis and systematic review assessed the efficacy of alkaloids in attenuating infarct size in rats with myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. METHODS: An integrated literature search including the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases was performed to identify studies that evaluated the therapeutic effects of alkaloids on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats. The main outcome was infarct size, and SYRCLE's risk of bias tool was used to assess the quality of the studies. RESULTS: 22 studies were brought into the meta-analysis. Compared with the effects of vehicle, alkaloids significantly reduced infarct size (standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.45; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = -0.64 to - 0.26). In subgroup analyses, isoquinoline alkaloids (SMD = -0.43; 95\%CI = -0.70 to - 0.16) significantly reduced infarct size versus the control. CONCLUSION: Isoquinoline alkaloids can potentially alleviate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. This meta-analysis and systematic review supply a reference for research programs aiming to develop alkaloid-based clinical drugs. This trial is registered with CRD42019135489.},

Currently, many studies regarding T. gondii infection in sheep have been published worldwide. However, there is no meta-analysis of sheep infection in China. In this study, five databases were used to retrieve articles related to T. gondii in China. A total of 59 studies from 1987 to June 30, 2020, have been included. We estimated that the combined prevalence of T. gondii in the selected period was 8.5\% (3197/28,099). In the analysis of publication year, the lowest positive rate after 2010 was 7.4\% (1883/17,313). Geographically, the highest prevalence of T. gondii in sheep was recorded in Southwest China 19.2\% (490/2080). Analysis according to age showed that the prevalence of infection in sheep older than 12 months was significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) higher than that in younger animals. The prevalence of T. gondii in sheep farmed by farmers was 7.2\% (566/6336), which was higher than 5.3\% (660/3121) of large-scale farming, suggesting a role for the feeding and husbandry. We also analyzed the impact of different geographic and climatic factors on the prevalence of T. gondii infection in sheep. The results showed that the prevalence was higher in low altitude, warm, humid, and high rainfall areas. We suggest that appropriate control programs should be formulated according to the differences in reproduction patterns and geographical conditions in different regions to reduce the prevalence of T. gondii among sheep in China.},

Many studies on Cryptosporidium infection in pigs have been reported worldwide. However, the meta-analysis of Cryptosporidium infection in pigs in China has not been published. This study retrieved articles related to Cryptosporidium in pigs in China by using four databases: Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), PubMed, VIP Chinese journal database and Wanfang Data. We retrieved 40 studies related to Cryptosporidium infection in China, and those articles were harvested from the inception to 1 January 2020. We estimated that the overall prevalence of pigs with Cryptosporidium in the selected period was 12.2\% (4,349/30,404). In the sampling year subgroup, the prevalence rate after 2010 was the lowest at 8.7\% (2,087/18,100). In Northern China, the Cryptosporidium prevalence was 47.9\% (34/71). By contrast, the prevalence of Cryptosporidium in Southwestern China was only 6.9\% (778/6,445). The infection rate of Cryptosporidium in diarrhoea pigs of 15.6\% (74/384) was higher than that in non-diarrhoea pigs at 10.8\% (378/2,840). Among the four age groups, the prevalence of weaning pigs of 16.2\% (530/3,243) was the highest, and the difference was significant (p {\textless} .05). The prevalence of Cryptosporidium in extensive farming was 25.7\% (660/3,121), which was significantly higher than in intensive farming 8.7\% (566/6,336), and the prevalence of infection was related to the farming modes (p {\textless} .05). We also analysed the impact of different geographic factor subgroups (longitude, latitude, precipitation, temperature, humidity, climate and altitude) on the prevalence of pigs. The results showed that cryptosporidiosis was widespread in pigs in China. We suggest that appropriate control schemes should be developed according to the differences in breeding patterns and geographic conditions in different regions, and effective management measures should be developed to reduce the spread between pigs.},

We conducted a systemic review regarding virus-induced pathogenesis, vaccine development, and diagnosis of H7N9 AIV infection in humans. We followed PRISMA guidelines and searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar to identify relevant articles published between January 2013 and December 2018. Pathogenesis data indicated that H7N9 AIV belongs to low pathogenic avian influenza, which is mostly asymptomatic in avian species; however, H7N9 induces high mortality in humans. Sporadic human infections have recently been reported, caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses detected in poultry. H7N9 AIVs resistant to adamantine and oseltamivir cause severe human infection by rapidly inducing progressive acute community-acquired pneumonia, multiorgan dysfunction, and cytokine dysregulation; however, mechanisms via which the virus induces severe syndromes remain unclear. An H7N9 AIV vaccine is lacking; designs under evaluation include synthesized peptide, baculovirus-insect system, and virus-like particle vaccines. Molecular diagnosis of H7N9 AIVs is suggested over conventional assays, for biosafety reasons. Several advanced or modified diagnostic assays are under investigation and development. We summarized virus-induced pathogenesis, vaccine development, and current diagnostic assays in H7N9 AIVs.},

Here, we present the first meta-analysis and integrated assessment of gaseous emissions and mitigation potentials for a typical beef cattle feedlot system, including methane (CH(4)), nitrous oxide (N(2)O), and NH(3) losses from enteric fermentation and manure management based on data from 104 studies. A total of 14 integrated emission factors (EF) and the mitigation efficiencies (ME) of 17 available options were provided. The estimated GHG and NH(3) emissions from the baseline feedlot system were 2786 ± 108 kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO(2)-eq) per animal unit (AU) per year and 49.1 ± 1.5 kg NH(3) AU(-1) year(-1), respectively. Enteric CH(4) fermentation and manure on the feedlot contributed 67.5\% and 80.8\% of the total system GHG and NH(3) emissions, respectively. The highest ME values were found for lipid additives for enteric CH(4) fermentation and urease inhibitor additives (UI) for NH(3) emissions from manure on the feedlot, being -14.9\% ( p {\textless} 0.05) and -59.5\% ( p {\textless} 0.001), respectively. The recommended mitigation combinations of a low-crude-protein (CP) diet and a UI additive for manure on the feedlot could reduce the GHG of the system by 4.9\% and NH(3) by 50.9\%. The results of this study have important implications for developing sustainable beef cattle feedlot systems from the viewpoint of GHG and NH(3) mitigation.},

Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the available preclinical evidence and possible mechanisms of baicalein for animal models of PD. Ultimately, 20 studies were identified by searching 7 databases from inception to December 2019. Review Manager 5.3 was applied for data analysis. Meta-analyses showed baicalein can significantly improve neurobehavioral function in animal models with PD, including spontaneous motor activity test (n = 5), pole test (n = 2), rotarod test (n = 9), apomorphine-induced rotations test (n = 4), grid test (n = 2), and tremor test (n = 2). Compared with controls, the results of the meta-analysis showed baicalein exerted a significant effect in increasing the frequency of spontaneous activity, prolongating the total time for climbing down the pole, decreasing the number of rotations, prolongating the descent latency, reducing the amplitude, and the frequency in animal models with PD. The possible mechanisms of baicalein for PD are regulating neurotransmitters, adjusting enzyme activity, antioxidation, anti-inflammatory, inhibiting protein aggregation, restorating mitochondrial dysfunction, inhibiting apoptosis, and autophagy. In conclusion, these findings preliminarily demonstrated that baicalein exerts potential neuroprotective effects through multiple signaling pathways in animal models of PD.},

	abstract = {Broiler and layer productions are important ammonia (NH$_{\textrm{3}}$) emission sources in the livestock industry. Here, we present the first meta-analysis and integrated assessment of NH$_{\textrm{3}}$ emissions and mitigation potentials for typical broiler litter manure management system (MMS) and layer manure belt MMS based on data from 96 studies. A total of 10 integrated NH$_{\textrm{3}}$ emission factors (EFs) and the NH$_{\textrm{3}}$ mitigation efficiencies (MEs) of 14 available options were provided. The estimated NH$_{\textrm{3}}$ emissions from the baseline scenarios of the broiler litter MMS and the layer manure belt MMS were 84.1 +or- 5.9 kg AU$^{\textrm{-1}}$ yr$^{\textrm{-1}}$ and 53.5 +or- 15.8 kg AU$^{\textrm{-1}}$ yr$^{\textrm{-1}}$, respectively. The NH$_{\textrm{3}}$ mitigation for the broiler litter MMS should be focused on the in-house stage, while the mitigation in the layer manure belt MMS should be focused on the outdoor and land application stages. The recommended NH$_{\textrm{3}}$ mitigation options for the in-house stage, the outdoor stage and the land application stage were acid scrubber (-92.5\%), compost biofilter (-71.9\%) and changing the manure surface application to incorporation (-83.0\%), respectively. The recommended mitigation combinations of low crude protein (LCP) diet, acid scrubber, compost biofilter and manure incorporation achieved the highest NH$_{\textrm{3}}$ mitigation efficiency from both broiler litter MMS and layer manure belt MMS, by 89.3\% and 84.8\%, respectively. The results of this study have important implications for developing sustainable poultry production systems from the viewpoint of NH$_{\textrm{3}}$ mitigation. The environment issues such as the other reactive nitrogen emissions and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions should also be considered in the future.},

Experimental and field studies from 1940 to 2019 for broiler chickens (1-70 days old, 40 g - 3.2 kg), laying hens (4-15 months old, 1.1-2.0 kg), and turkeys (1 day-14 months old, 60 g -12.7 kg) were searched systematically using PubMed, Google Scholar, ProQuest, and ScienceDirect for data collection in 2019 and 2020. Relevant data were extracted from the literature with mean and standard deviation (SD) being calculated and compiled in tables of relative organ weights (\% of body weight) and relative blood flows (\% of cardiac output). Trends of organ or tissue weight growth during different life stages were calculated when sufficient data were available. These compiled data sets facilitate future PBPK model development and applications, especially in estimating chemical residue concentrations in edible tissues to calculate food safety withdrawal intervals for poultry.},

Its effect on reproductive performance, however, is inconsistent due to conflicting data in the scientific literature. A meta-analysis of published data, therefore, was performed to determine whether altrenogest affects gilt and sow reproductive performance. Altrenogest administration to pigs enhanced the number of piglets born alive per litter (NBA), total number born per litter (TNB), estrous rate within 10 days after treatment (ER(10)) and pregnancy rate (PR) as well as the farrowing rate (FR) of gilts. The NBA and TNB of primiparous sows fed altrenogest were improved although FR was less. In multiparous sows, altrenogest treatment did not result in any improvement for any of the five analyzed variables. Additionally, 14-day treatment regimens for gilts and {\textgreater}8-days for primiparous sows improved reproductive performance and extent of estrous synchrony. The effects of altrenogest on reproductive performance of swine were parity and treatment duration dependent.},

This study aimed to identify human-relevant correlates between PFOA exposure and the male rodent reproductive system. We performed a systematic literature review of the relevant literature of PubMed, Cochrane Library databases, Web of Science and Embase from the establishment to April 2020. Studies included the effects of PFOA on the reproductive system of male rodents. The meta-analysis was performed on the basis of the following points: level of testosterone and estradiol in serum, development of reproductive organs, pathological changes of reproduction organs and parameters of semen. A series of 16 studies was enrolled in this study. The standard mean difference (SMD) for PFOA-related reproductive toxicity was summarised as -0.39 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71, -0.07). The lower serum testosterone levels, decreased absolute testicular and epididymal weights, higher serum estradiol levels, elevated relative testicular and seminal vesicle weights and increased incidence of Leydig cell adenoma and percentage of abnormal sperm were observed in the exposed group compared with the control group. However, no statistical difference was found in the day of preputial separation of pups and percentage of motile sperm. In conclusion, PFOA exposure heightens the reproductive system damage in male rodents. However, many studies included in the review did not identify mechanisms by which PFOA induces changes to the male reproductive system, which is an area for additional study.},

We aimed to establish the prevalence of Cryptosporidium, misrosporidia, and Isospora in HIV-infected people using a systematic review and meta-analysis, which is central to developing public policy and clinical services. METHODS: We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, Embase, Chinese Web of Knowledge, Wanfang, and Chongqing VIP databases for studies reporting Cryptosporidium, microsporidia, or Isospora infection in HIV-infected people. We extracted the numbers of people with HIV and protozoa infection, and estimated the pooled prevalence of parasite infection by a random effects model. RESULTS: Our research identified 131 studies that reported Cryptosporidium, microsporidia, and Isospora infection in HIV-infected people. We estimated the pooled prevalence to be 14.0\% (3283/43,218; 95\% CI: 13.0-15.0\%) for Cryptosporidium, 11.8\% (1090/18,006; 95\% CI: 10.1-13.4\%) for microsporidia, and 2.5\% (788/105,922; 95\% CI: 2.1-2.9\%) for Isospora. A low prevalence of microsporidia and Isospora infection was found in high-income countries, and a high prevalence of Cryptosporidium and Isospora infection was found in sub-Saharan Africa. We also detected a high prevalence of Cryptosporidium, microsporidia, and Isospora infection in patients with diarrhea. Sensitivity analysis showed that three studies significantly affect the prevalence of Isospora, which was adjusted to 5.0\% (469/8570; 95\% CI: 4.1-5.9\%) by excluding these studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that HIV-infected people have a high prevalence of Cryptosporidium, microsporidia, and Isospora infection in low-income countries and patients with diarrhea, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, reinforcing the importance of routine surveillance for opportunistic intestinal protozoa in HIV-infected people.},

	abstract = {Management of burn patients is challenging, and requires a lot of knowledge and experience gained through research. However, experimental study on humans is not morally and ethically accepted. Porcine is the most frequently used experimental model because pig skin is anatomically and physiologically similar to human skin. We included systematic reviews, meta analyses, and experimental studies of burns using porcine models. We excluded studies conducted more than 10 years ago and which included only thermal injuries. Burn injury made to the porcine model had to be second or third degree. Searches of Ovid MEDLINE, Pubmed, Burns Journal and Cochrane Library revealed 21 relevant studies. Three methods used to create full thickness burn wounds were found: aluminium, brass, and immersion in hot water. The aluminium bar was heated to 200°C and placed on the pig's skin for 20 seconds. For deep dermal burns, there are different methods: modified glass bottle and aluminium bar. The bottle is filled with sterile water and heated to the desired temperature (92°C), then placed on the pig's skin for 15 seconds. To measure burn wound depth, almost all the studies used histopathological evaluation. There was no standardised method to create burn wounds in porcine models. Nevertheless, for deep dermal burn wounds, we can use the modified glass bottle method and for full thickness burn wounds, we can use aluminium or brass. There are no previous studies discussing how to make burn porcine models, nor any studies in this review that focused on creating the burn wound alone. Further studies are needed to achieve better results in creating burn wounds in porcine models.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Variation in the human microbiome has been linked with a variety of physiological functions, including immune regulation and metabolism and biosynthesis of vitamins, hormones, and neurotransmitters. Evidence for extraskeletal effects of vitamin D has been accruing and it has been suggested that the effect of vitamin D on health is partially mediated through the microbiome. We aimed to critically evaluate the evidence linking vitamin D and the gastrointestinal microbiome. METHODS: We systematically searched the Embase, Web of Science, PubMed and CINAHL databases, including peer-reviewed publications that reported an association between a measure of vitamin D and the gastrointestinal microbiome in humans or experimental animals. RESULTS: We included 10 mouse and 14 human studies. Mouse studies compared mice fed diets containing different levels of vitamin D (usually high versus low), or vitamin D receptor knockout or Cyp27B1 knockout with wild-type mice. Five mouse studies reported an increase in Bacteroidetes (or taxa within that phylum) in the low vitamin D diet or gene knockout group. Human studies were predominantly observational; all but two of the included studies found some association between vitamin D and the gut microbiome, but the nature of differences observed varied across studies. CONCLUSIONS: Despite substantial heterogeneity, we found evidence to support the hypothesis that vitamin D influences the composition of the gastrointestinal microbiome. However, the research is limited, having been conducted either in mice or in mostly small, selected human populations. Future research in larger population-based studies is needed to fully understand the extent to which vitamin D modulates the microbiome.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that infects approximately 30\% of the population of the United States, with worldwide distribution. The chronic (latent) infection, mediated by the bradyzoite parasite life stage, has attracted attention due to possible links to host behavioral alteration and psychomotor effects. Mice are a common model organism for studying the chronic stage, as they are natural hosts of infection. Notably, published studies demonstrate vast ranges of measured cyst burden within the murine brain tissue. The inconsistency of measured cyst burden within and between experiments makes interpretation of statistical significance difficult, potentially confounding studies of experimental anti-parasitic approaches. This review analyzes variation in measured cyst burden in a wide array of experimental mouse infections across published literature. Factors such as parasite infection strain, mouse strain, mode of infection, and infectious dose were all examined. The lowest variation in measured cyst burden occurred with the commonly available Balb/c and CBA mice undergoing infection by the ME49 strain of T. gondii. A summary of cyst variation and average cyst counts in T. gondii mouse models is presented, which may be useful for designing future experiments.},

Here, to investigate sources of this heterogeneity, we perform meta-analyses of published studies on the relationship between carotenoid-based feather coloration and measures of individual quality. To create color displays, animals use either carotenoids unchanged from dietary components or carotenoids that they biochemically convert before deposition. We hypothesize that converted carotenoids better reflect individual quality because of the physiological links between cellular function and carotenoid metabolism. We show that feather coloration is an honest signal of some, but not all, measures of quality. Where these relationships exist, we show that converted, but not dietary, carotenoid coloration drives the relationship. Our results have broad implications for understanding the evolutionary role of carotenoid coloration and the physiological mechanisms that maintain signal honesty of animal ornamental traits.},

Relevant studies that meet standard inclusion criteria were identified and extracted from China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang and Chinese Scientific Journal (VIP) databases. A total of 9 studies with 539 subjects were included. A meta-analysis was performed with STATA15.0 to estimate the combined standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI). Heterogeneity test of articles was examined by Q-test, and the results showed that P values of feed conversion ratio, average daily gain (ADG), and average daily intake were all less than 0.05, suggesting a strong heterogeneity among the selected literature. Therefore, the random effect model is selected to calculate the SMD of the three indexes. The combined SMDs (95\% CI) of feed:gain, ADG, and average daily feed intake (ADFI) were -0.39 (-1.03, 0.25), 0.26 (-0.29, 0.81), and -1.45 (-3.09, 0.20), respectively, and the P values were all less than 0.05. This study shows that the absolute differences in the growth performance (feed:gain, ADG, and ADFI) of broilers fed with either organic or inorganic Se supplements at the same dose were quite small. The P values of Egger's test were 0.770, 0.089, and 0.426, respectively, for the above indexes, showing no significant publication bias. Sensitivity analysis ensured the stability and reliability of the results. In summary, the effects of organic and inorganic Se in feed on the growth performance of broilers are statistically equal.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii is a widely distributed protozoan parasite that can infect a variety of warm-blooded animals including humans and goats. This is the first meta-analysis to assess the overall seroprevalence and potential risk factors of T. gondii infection among goats in China. Databases including the VIP Chinese Journal Databases (VIP), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, WanFang, ScienceDirect, and PubMed were searched comprehensively for relevant studies published from 2010 to date. A random-effects model was used to calculate pooled seroprevalence estimates with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) and data were analyzed from 13 provinces in China. The pooled T. gondii seroprevalence in goats was estimated as 9.9\%. Goats T. gondii had the highest seroprevalence in Southwestern China (13.3\%) and the lowest in Northeastern China (7.3\%). The seroprevalence in the sub-group before 2012 (8.0\%) was lower than that in 2012-2015 (15.2\%) and 2016 or later (9.2\%). Goats aged {\textgreater} 12-months had a higher seroprevalence (11.7\%) than 12-months (10.7\%). The seroprevalence in female goats was 12.5\% and 12.2\% in male goats. In season subgroups, the seroprevalence was lowest in autumn (6.1\%). Naturally grazed goats had a seroprevalence of 8.1\% of infection and 7.8\% in intensively fed goats. We also evaluated the effects of geographical and climate variables on the pooled seroprevalence of T. gondii in goats in China. The results indicated that toxoplasmosis is widely distributed in goats in China. In the context of ensuring animal welfare, we suggest the continued promotion of the transition from natural grazing to intensive agriculture to strengthen disease prevention. Prevention would be better carried out in areas suitable for the survival and reproduction of T. gondii. Breeders need to regularly disinfect the feeding areas and pens or other areas of goat activity thoroughly to reduce the impact of environmental factors responses on the infection of goats to T. gondii.},

Relevant studies were comprehensively collected from ScienceDirect, Springer-Link, PubMed, VIP Chinese Journal Databases (VIP), WanFang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases. The random-effect model was used to calculate pooled prevalence with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) and analyzed data were from 20 countries. The pooled T. gondii prevalence in foxes was estimated to be 39.6\%. T. gondii has the highest prevalence in North America (51.2\%), and lowest in Asia (8.3\%). The prevalence in the sub-group after 2006 (44.7\%) was lower than 2006 or before (48.5\%). The prevalence in female foxes was 46.1\%, which was higher than that in male foxes (19.7\%). In species subgroup, red fox has the highest prevalence (46.8\%). Wild foxes have a higher rate of infection (40.8\%) than captive foxes (8.4\%). Genotype Ⅱ of T. gondii is the most prevalent in foxes. We also evaluated the effects of geographical and climate variables on pooled prevalence of T. gondii in foxes. Our research indicated that toxoplasmosis widely existed in the world. The investigation of T. gondii infection in wild animals can provide an estimate of environmental pollution and T. gondii circulation in the ecosystem. It is essential for us to prevent and control T. gondii infection in foxes in order to reduce the risk of human infection.},

Various surgical interventions have been described, but effective technique is currently considered to be a matter of personal clinician preference. The aim of this rapid review was to evaluate existing peer-reviewed evidence of effectiveness for surgical techniques and their subsequent effects on quantitative and clinical lacrimal outcomes for PNG. We performed a structured bibliographic search of CAB Abstracts, PubMed, and Medline using terms relevant to dogs, nictitans gland, and surgery on 13 September 2017. Included studies were assessed for study design, reporting characteristics, surgical techniques, and surgical and lacrimal outcomes. Fifteen of three hundred fifteen identified studies were eligible for inclusion. Seven different replacement techniques were identified, along with gland excision. All studies were observational or descriptive, with the exception of a single crossover trial. Outcomes reporting was heterogeneous and provided limited detail on lacrimal outcomes or on breed propensity for recurrence. Insufficient data precluded comparison of techniques for either surgical failure rates or lacrimal outcomes, although proportional meta-analysis yielded an overall failure rate of 3\% (95\% CI 1⁻7\%) for the Morgan's pocket procedure. Improved reporting of veterinary surgical studies will improve evidence appraisal and synthesis, as well as reduce potential sources of bias.},

Methodological quality of the studies was assessed using a modified McMaster critical appraisal tool. RESULTS: Ten studies met the inclusion criteria and overall, positive trends were identified in behavioural, psychological and physical outcome measures following the participation in an EAT. However, due to methodological constraints, caution is required when interpreting these findings. CONCLUSION: While EAT may offer some positive benefits for children with ADHD, further methodologically robust research is required before definitive recommendations can be made.},

With the exception of studies on cold-stressed laying hens, the results of studies of Cr supplementation of chickens, whether broilers or laying hens, were found to be too inconsistent for any firm conclusions to be drawn other than that Cr supplementation generally leads to accumulation of Cr in tissues. Few potential trends in terms or beneficial or deleterious effects from Cr supplementation were found regardless of strain of chicken, Cr source, Cr dose, duration of supplementation, or variable examined. Hence, in summary, no recommendation for the use of Cr as a supplement for the diet of chickens can be made at this time.},

Studies were appraised for quality using the SYstematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) risk of bias tool. In spite of an acceptable number of studies being located, few studies examined the same pairwise comparisons. Additionally, there was considerable heterogeneity in study design and outcomes, with many studies being at a high risk of bias. Consequently, results were synthesised using the Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) reporting guidelines. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was utilised for assessment of certainty in the evidence. Due to the heterogeneity and GRADE findings, it was concluded that there was not enough high-quality evidence to make any recommendations on the optimal method of blood sampling.

The MGS has been employed mainly in the evaluation of acute pain, particularly in the pain and neuroscience research fields. There has, however, been use of the technique in a wide range of fields, and based on limited study it does appear to have utility for pain assessment across a spectrum of animal models. Use of the method allows the detection of pain of a longer duration, up to a month post initial insult.

	abstract = {The reported incidence of clinical hepatitis E cases is rising in some non-endemic countries, with concurrent concerns regarding potential hepatitis E virus (HEV) contamination of the blood supply. Therefore, the characterization of major potential sources of human HEV exposure is important to inform risk assessment and public health policy. A systematic review was conducted, including a comprehensive search in six electronic bibliographic databases, verified by hand-searching reference lists of HEV reviews, and a grey literature search, of the broad research question 'what is the evidence of the association between predictors of human HEV exposure, and HEV IgG seropositivity, in non-endemic countries?' Using forms designed a priori, captured studies were appraised at first-level screening, second-level characterization, and third-level data extraction and risk of bias assessment. Meta-analysis yielded summary estimates of association between potential predictors and odds of HEV seropositivity. Meta-analysis and meta-regression of the odds of HEV seroprevalence in specific groups characterized potential sources of HEV exposure. From 4,163 captured citations, 245 relevant studies underwent data extraction, investigating HEV seroprevalence or predictors in both healthy subjects and targeted patient groups. Across these groups, increasing age was a predictor of HEV IgG seropositivity. Both human immunodeficiency virus patients and haemodialysis patients had significantly increased odds of HEV seropositivity relative to the general population. Working with pigs, in forestry, or in hospitals, was significantly associated with increased odds of HEV seropositivity, as were consumption of meat, pork or game meat, or hunting. Chronological time was not associated with HEV seropositivity within our data sets. Further study of the distribution of potential dietary or behavioural predictors between high and lower prevalence areas within non-endemic countries could improve our understanding of the relative importance of specific HEV transmission pathways.},

	abstract = {Effective infection control (IC) provides a safe environment for staff, clients and animals of veterinary practices by reducing the risk of nosocomial and zoonotic infections, which are associated with increased hospital stays, costs, morbidity and mortality. An equally important issue arising from nosocomial infection is the loss of trust between the client and the veterinary practice that has potential negative impacts on the veterinary practice in terms of economic risk and the well-being of staff. Furthermore, an emerging and significant threat, in this context, is antimicrobial resistance. The aim of this systematic review was to critically review published reports that documented current IC practices and evaluated interventions to improve IC practices. A systematic literature search using ten databases to identify papers published over a 20-year period (February 1996 to February 2016) was conducted for studies that met the inclusion criteria. Included studies were assessed using the PRISMA and STROBE-Vet statements. A total of 14 of 1,615 identified studies met our inclusion criteria. Infection control practices included hand hygiene, sharps handling, environmental cleaning, personal protective equipment and personnel vaccination. Descriptive studies were the predominant research design for assessing IC compliance. Only three studies were interventions. Compliance with IC protocols was poor and only marginally increased with multimodal educational campaigns. There was significant variation in the implementation of IC by veterinary staff. Workplaces that had IC policies, management support and a staff member supporting their implementation were more likely to embrace good IC. Infection control data in veterinary practices were inconsistently reported and collected. Clearly defining IC and determining prevalence of these practices within the veterinary field is important given the limited research in this area. Further, developing and implementing educational campaigns for this sector is needed.},

	abstract = {Concerns over elephant welfare in UK zoos have implications for their future in captivity. To monitor improvements made to elephant welfare in UK zoos, non-invasive, valid and reliable indicators of welfare are needed. Using a rapid review strategy and critical appraisal tool, we aimed to appraise evidence from peer-reviewed literature on potential welfare indicators for captive elephants. Scopus, Web of Knowledge and Ovid were searched in January 2014 using terms relevant to captive elephants and welfare assessment. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and remaining articles were critically appraised against a specially designed welfare indicator appraisal tool. Thirty-seven unique indicators of welfare were extracted from 30 peer-reviewed papers which met the inclusion criteria. Behavioural measures of welfare (n=21) were more common than either physical (n=11) or physiological (n=5) measures. Stereotypies were the most frequently used behavioural measure, glucocorticoids were the most frequently used physiological measure and body condition scores were the most frequently used physical measure. There was most support for the following indicators of improved welfare state: reduced stereotypies, reduced glucocorticoids and improved body condition scores. Additional measures which require further validation but had strong associations with the most supported measures, and thus have potential use in welfare assessment, were: increased lying rest and positive social interactions. Further validation of the described measures is needed, but this information forms a crucial part of the knowledge required to efficiently monitor and improve the welfare of elephants in captivity.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Conducting effective and culturally sensitive dog health education programs in Aboriginal communities requires an understanding of appropriate adult education and community development principles. Finding relevant material can be difficult, given that many of the available resources are in the 'grey literature'. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To critically review publications addressing the principles governing dog health education in remote Aboriginal communities. METHODS: A critical review was performed by searching English language peer-reviewed and grey literature databases for papers published between 2010 and 2018. Besides a small number of peer-reviewed papers, there was an extensive list of reports, educational material, guidelines and posters and pamphlets that illustrated the principles. Only a small amount of this grey literature was selected for the review. Selection was based on the publication illustrating a specific principle of dog health education. The material was organised around educational themes highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of these publications. RESULTS: Findings suggested that although relevant literature is scattered, there are clear processes for conducting culturally appropriate and effective dog health programs in Australian Indigenous communities. Two major principles were identified: acknowledging the effect on education of the ambiguity around the status of dogs in Aboriginal communities, and embedding programs within a social determinant of health framework or community development approach. These two principles provide guidance on negotiating educational sessions, the preparation of culturally appropriate materials, teaching sessions and what learning styles to foster and the use of a health promotion approach. CONCLUSIONS: Some contradictions exist within the literature, particularly around the use of images, and consistent with the first principle, a hesitancy to engage with Aboriginal people around the issue of dog health.},

	doi = {10.3168/jds.2017-14092},
	abstract = {Disbudding is a common management procedure performed on dairy farms and, when done without pain mitigation, is viewed as a key welfare issue. Use of pain control has increased in recent years, but full adoption of anesthesia and analgesia by veterinarians or dairy producers has not been achieved. This may in part be due to the lack of a consistent recommendations of treatment protocols between studies examining pain control methods for disbudding. The objective of this systematic review was to examine the effects of these pain control practices for the most common method of disbudding, cautery, on outcomes associated with disbudding pain in calves. The outcomes were plasma cortisol concentrations, pressure sensitivity of the horn bud area, and validated pain behaviors (ear flick, head shake, head rub, foot stamp, and vocalization). Intervention studies describing cautery disbudding in calves 12 wk of age or younger were eligible, provided they compared local anesthesia, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), or local anesthesia and NSAID to 1 or more of local anesthesia, NSAID, or no pain control. The search strategy used the Agricola, Medline (via OvidSP), and Web of Science databases, as well as the Searchable Proceedings of Animal Conferences (S-PAC), ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Database, and Open Access Theses and Dissertations. Meta-analysis was performed for all outcomes measured at similar time points with more than 2 studies. Local anesthetic was associated with reduced plasma cortisol until 2 h postdisbudding; however, a rise in cortisol was observed in the meta-analysis of studies reporting at 4 h postdisbudding. Heterogeneity was present in several of the analyses for this comparison. The addition of NSAID to local anesthetic showed reduction in plasma cortisol at 4 h, and a reduction in pressure sensitivity and pain behaviors in some analyses between 3 and 6 h postdisbudding. Heterogeneity was present in some meta-analyses, including several using pain behavior outcomes. This may reflect the variation in measurement time periods for behavioral measures between studies, as well as differences among NSAID treatments. Overall, a protective effect of local anesthetic was seen for the acute pain of cautery disbudding, and the delayed rise in cortisol was mitigated by the addition of an NSAID, which also reduced other signs of pain, including pressure sensitivity and pain behaviors. Based on these findings, we recommend use of local anesthetic and an NSAID as best practices for pain mitigation for cautery disbudding of calves 12 wk of age or less. The magnitude and duration of the effect of NSAID treatment was not possible to deduce from the literature because wide variation existed between studies. We recommend consideration of more standardized outcome measurements, especially for pain behaviors. Adherence to reporting guidelines by authors would help ensure more transparent and complete information is available to end users.},

Controlled trials in lactating dairy cattle with natural disease exposure were eligible if they compared an antimicrobial treatment to a non-treated control, placebo, or a different antimicrobial, for the treatment of clinical mastitis, and assessed clinical or bacteriologic cure. Potential for bias was assessed using a modified Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. From 14775 initially identified records, 54 trials were assessed as eligible. Networks were established for bacteriologic cure by bacterial species group, and clinical cure. Disparate networks among bacteriologic cures precluded meta-analysis. Network meta-analysis was conducted for trials assessing clinical cure, but lack of precision of point estimates resulted in wide credibility intervals for all treatments, with no definitive conclusions regarding relative efficacy. Consideration of network geometry can inform future research to increase the utility of current and previous work. Replication of intervention arms and consideration of connection to existing networks would improve the future ability to determine relative efficacy. Challenges in the evaluation of bias in primary research stemmed from a lack of reporting. Consideration of reporting guidelines would also improve the utility of future research.},

	abstract = {Q fever caused by the gram negative bacteria, Coxiella burnetii, is an occupational hazard for those who live and work in rural settings and those who are in contact with animals, especially abattoir and slaughterhouse workers. Australia is the only country to register a vaccine to prevent Q fever (Q-vaxR, Seqirus, Australia) that is used in high risk populations. Seroprevalence studies conducted to determine the burden of Q fever (C. burnetii infection) in different settings have demonstrated high levels of heterogeneity with estimates of the percent positive ranging from 30\% to 70\%. There is a need for a more systematic evaluation of the findings of these studies in order to provide summary estimates of the seroprevalence in different settings. We searched for published articles using PubMed, MEDLINE-EMBASE, and Scopus databases using search terms obtained from an initial review of published reports of recent Q fever outbreaks. Data on the seroprevalence of C. burnetii infection (Q fever) was extracted from the selected studies and a random effects meta-analysis was performed with stratification by outbreak status, year, country and serological techniques used. Results were visualised with a forest plot with 95\% CI and measures of heterogeneity (I$^{\textrm{2}}$) for the random effects model. A total of 19 articles that met the search criteria were included. The reported seroprevalence rate ranged from 4.7\% to 91.7\% among abattoir and slaughterhouse workers. No inter-group heterogeneity was observed (p=0.956), supporting the pooling of all studies into one pooled measure. The pooled estimate of seropositivity for C. burnetii infection in people working in abattoirs and slaughterhouses was 26\% (95\% CI: 18-35\%) regardless of the evidence of an "outbreak", the time of year or country. Seropositivity for C burnetii was independent of a person's age and years of occupational experience. Within abattoirs and slaughterhouses, slaughtering of cattle, sheep and goats are the most important risk factors associated with seropositivity and for those who showed over symptoms upon infection. We recommend that vaccination programmes are directed towards people employed in the meat processing industry to mitigate the significant health and economic impacts of Q fever.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Osteosynthesis-associated infection is a challenging complication post fracture fixation, burdening the patients and the orthopaedic surgeons alike. A clinically relevant animal model is critical in devising new therapeutic strategies. Our aim was to perform a systematic review to evaluate existing preclinical models and identify their applications in aspects of animal selection, bacterial induction, fracture fixation and complications. METHODS: A systematic literature research was conducted in PubMed and Embase up to February 2020. A total of 31 studies were included. Information on the animal, bacterial induction, fracture fixation, healing result and complications were extracted. RESULTS: Animals selected included murine (23), rabbit (6), ewe (1) and goat (1). Larger animals had enabled the use of human-sized implant, however small animals were more economical and easier in handling. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) was the most frequently chosen bacteria for induction. Bacterial inoculation dose ranged from 10(2-8) ​CFU. Consistent and replicable infections were observed from 10(4) ​CFU in general. Methods of inoculation included injections of bacterial suspension (20), placement of foreign objects (8) and pretreatment of implants with established biofilm (3). Intramedullary implants (13), plates and screws (18) were used in most models. Radiological (29) and histological evaluations (24) in osseous healing were performed. Complications such as instability of fracture fixation (7), unexpected surgical death (5), sepsis (1) and persistent lameness (1) were encountered. CONCLUSION: The most common animal model is the S. aureus infected open fracture internally fixated. Replicable infections were mainly from 10(4) ​CFU of bacteria. However, with the increase in antibiotic resistance, future directions should explore polymicrobial and antibiotic resistant strains, as these will no doubt play a major role in bone infection. Currently, there is also a lack of osteoporotic bone infection models and the pathophysiology is unexplored, which would be important with our aging population. THE TRANSLATIONAL POTENTIAL OF THIS ARTICLE: This systematic review provides an updated overview and compares the currently available animal models of osteosynthesis-associated infections. A discussion on future research directions and suggestion of animal model settings were made, which is expected to advance the research in this field.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently given to patients with acute pancreatitis (AP) for controlling pain, but their efficacy in treating AP, particularly in reducing systemic complications, remains unclear. AIM: The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of NSAIDs in treating AP and its systematic complications. METHODS: Two independent reviewers screened articles from MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane and scored the quality of each study according to the CAMARADES 10-item quality checklist or the Jadad scale. Five endpoints were chosen to evaluate the effect of NSAIDs in animal studies: amylase and lipase levels, proinflammatory cytokines, oxidative damage, histopathological changes, and mortality rate. Meanwhile, in clinical studies, endpoints, such as proinflammatory cytokines, pain relief, systematic complications, mortality, and adverse events were used. RESULTS: A total of 36 studies out of 17,845 were identified and included. Of these 36 studies, only 5 were clinical trials involving 580 patients, and the remaining 31 were animal studies with 1623 rats or mice. 24 studies focused on the treatment of AP with NSAIDs and 12 on AP-associated systematic complications. Both preclinical and clinical studies showed that NSAIDs may have beneficial effects against AP-related injuries. 9 of the 14 preclinical studies stated that NSAIDs reduced the serum amylase level significantly, and 6 of 7 showed that NSAIDs lowered the lipase level markedly. 17 experimental studies all demonstrated that NSAIDs reduced the inflammation. Histopathological examinations indicated that NSAIDs significantly improved the histopathological damages. Similarly, clinical evidence showed that NSAIDs are effective in suppressing proinflammatory cytokines, relieving pain, ameliorating systematic complications and reducing mortality. In the included 5 clinical studies, serious adverse events associated with NSAIDs were rarely reported. CONCLUSION: This systematic review shows that NSAIDs are a potential treatment for AP-related injuries based on the current preclinical and clinical evidences.},

Inter-study heterogeneity was explored using stratified analyses of study design, geographic region, or whether studies adjusted for the confounders age, sex, body mass index, smoking, and education level. We extracted data from 16 studies on milk (5,193 subjects) and 10 studies on dairy products (20,434 subjects). The total study population included 220,952 individuals. Dairy product intake and bladder cancer risk were significantly associated, and milk intake and bladder cancer risk more so. Stratified analysis revealed that the trend was more pronounced in case-control studies, and in studies with impact factor {\textless}3 and in Asia. The relationship was confirmed after adjusting for sex and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale score of 7 and 8. Our study shows an inverse association between milk consumption and bladder cancer risk.},

This systematic review aimed to evaluate whether early life (the first 1,000 days) natural exposure to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and ruminant trans fatty acids (R-TFA) could affect the AD risk. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception through September 10, 2017 for relevant full-text articles in English. Observational studies were selected if they examined the effects of early life PUFA or R-TFA on AD (eczema, asthma, wheeze, and allergic rhinitis) or sensitization. The quality of studies was examined by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the best evidence synthesis (BES) was applied. We included 26 observational studies, and 8 of them showed high quality. BES showed a moderate evidence for the protective effect of vaccenic acid (VA, an R-TFA) on eczema, while insufficient or no evidence was found in other associations. Meta-analysis showed that higher n-6/n-3 ratio and linoleic acid were associated with higher risk of eczema (pooled odds ratio [OR] = 1.06, 95\% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.00 -1.13; 1.08, 95\% CI: 1.01 -1.15). However, VA was inversely associated with eczema pooled OR = 0.42, 95\% CI: 0.25 -0.72). Early life natural exposure to VA showed evident benefit on decreasing the risk of eczema, while PUFA and other R-TFA showed limited effects on AD. More robust studies especially for R-TFA are required.},

	abstract = {Although mangiferin has a number of documented beneficial effects, there are no systematic reviews or meta-analyses of its effects in diabetic animal models. To investigate the effects of oral administration of mangiferin on blood glucose levels, body weight, and total cholesterol and triglycerides levels in diabetic animal models, a meta-analysis was conducted and the underlying mechanisms were reviewed. Studies from 6 databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), and Wanfang Med) were searched from inception to April 2020. After article screening, a total of 19 articles were included in this meta-analysis. The meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 and STATA 14.0 software. The overall pooled estimate of standardized mean difference (SMD) of mangiferin's effect on blood glucose was -1.27 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: -1.71, -0.82, P {\textless} .00001). Body weight increased in lean diabetic animals with an SMD of 1.41 (95\% CI: 0.57, 2.25; P = .001), while it decreased in obese diabetic animals with an SMD of -0.92 (95\% CI: -1.69, -0.14; P = .02). Mangiferin intake reduced serum total cholesterol and triglycerides levels with SMDs of -1.02 (95\% CI: -1.43, -0.61; P {\textless} .001) and -1.24 (95\% CI: -1.70, -0.79; P {\textless} .001), respectively. The meta-analysis suggests that oral intake of mangiferin has a significant antidiabetic effect in animal models, and the systematic review suggested that this function might be attributed to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties, as well as to its function of improving glycolipid metabolism and enhancing insulin signaling.},

	abstract = {Large-scale phenotyping of animal behaviour traits is time consuming and has led to increased demand for technologies that can automate these procedures. Automated tracking of animals has been successful in controlled laboratory settings, but recording from animals in large groups in highly variable farm settings presents challenges. The aim of this review is to provide a systematic overview of the advances that have occurred in automated, high throughput image detection of farm animal behavioural traits with welfare and production implications. Peer-reviewed publications written in English were reviewed systematically following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. After identification, screening, and assessment for eligibility, 108 publications met these specifications and were included for qualitative synthesis. Data collected from the papers included camera specifications, housing conditions, group size, algorithm details, procedures, and results. Most studies utilized standard digital colour video cameras for data collection, with increasing use of 3D cameras in papers published after 2013. Papers including pigs (across production stages) were the most common (n = 63). The most common behaviours recorded included activity level, area occupancy, aggression, gait scores, resource use, and posture. Our review revealed many overlaps in methods applied to analysing behaviour, and most studies started from scratch instead of building upon previous work. Training and validation sample sizes were generally small (mean±s.d. groups = 3.8±5.8) and in data collection and testing took place in relatively controlled environments. To advance our ability to automatically phenotype behaviour, future research should build upon existing knowledge and validate technology under commercial settings and publications should explicitly describe recording conditions in detail to allow studies to be reproduced.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Racing performance is often used as a measurable outcome variable in research studies investigating clinical diagnoses or interventions. However, the use of many different performance measures largely precludes conduct of meaningful comparative studies and, to date, those being used have not been collated. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the veterinary scientific literature for the use of racing performance as a measurable outcome variable in clinical studies of racehorses, collate and identify those most popular, and identify their advantages and disadvantages. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature search. METHODS: The search criteria "((racing AND performance) AND (horses OR equidae))" were adapted for both MEDLINE and CAB Abstracts databases. Data were collected in standardised recording forms for binary, categorical and quantitative measures, and the use of performance indices. RESULTS: In total, 217 studies that described racing performance were identified, contributing 117 different performance measures. No one performance measure was used in all studies, despite 90.3\% using more than one variable. Data regarding race starts and earnings were used most commonly, with 88.0\% and 54.4\% of studies including at least one measure of starts and earnings, respectively. Seventeen variables were used 10 times or more, with the top five comprising: 'return to racing', 'number of starts', 'days to first start', 'earnings per period of time' and 'earnings per start'. MAIN LIMITATIONS: The search strategies may not have identified all relevant papers, introducing bias to the review. CONCLUSIONS: Performance indices have been developed to improve assessment of interventions; however, they are not widely adopted in the scientific literature. Use of the two most commonly identified measures, whether the horse returned to racing and number of starts over a defined period of time, would best facilitate future systematic reviews and meta-analyses in advance of the development of a gold-standard measure of race performance outcome.},

The analysis of the results shows that the diet used in the studies has a protein content of between 17 and 22\% for the control animals, and of between 0 and 9\% for the animals submitted to perinatal protein malnutrition. The main morphofunctional changes observed in the cardiovascular system are related to high blood pressure, increased apoptosis of cardiomyocytes, and reduction in the absolute size of the heart, among other ultrastructural and molecular changes.},

	doi = {10.1093/humupd/dmz017},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: A defining feature of sexual reproduction is the transmission of genomic information from both parents to the offspring. There is now compelling evidence that the inheritance of such genetic information is accompanied by additional epigenetic marks, or stable heritable information that is not accounted for by variations in DNA sequence. The reversible nature of epigenetic marks coupled with multiple rounds of epigenetic reprogramming that erase the majority of existing patterns have made the investigation of this phenomenon challenging. However, continual advances in molecular methods are allowing closer examination of the dynamic alterations to histone composition and DNA methylation patterns that accompany development and, in particular, how these modifications can occur in an individual's germline and be transmitted to the following generation. While the underlying mechanisms that permit this form of transgenerational inheritance remain unclear, it is increasingly apparent that a combination of genetic and epigenetic modifications plays major roles in determining the phenotypes of individuals and their offspring. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Information pertaining to transgenerational inheritance was systematically reviewed focusing primarily on mammalian cells to the exclusion of inheritance in plants, due to inherent differences in the means by which information is transmitted between generations. The effects of environmental factors and biological processes on both epigenetic and genetic information were reviewed to determine their contribution to modulating inheritable phenotypes. SEARCH METHODS: Articles indexed in PubMed were searched using keywords related to transgenerational inheritance, epigenetic modifications, paternal and maternal inheritable traits and environmental and biological factors influencing transgenerational modifications. We sought to clarify the role of epigenetic reprogramming events during the life cycle of mammals and provide a comprehensive review of how the genomic and epigenomic make-up of progenitors may determine the phenotype of its descendants. OUTCOMES: We found strong evidence supporting the role of DNA methylation patterns, histone modifications and even non-protein-coding RNA in altering the epigenetic composition of individuals and producing stable epigenetic effects that were transmitted from parents to offspring, in both humans and rodent species. Multiple genomic domains and several histone modification sites were found to resist demethylation and endure genome-wide reprogramming events. Epigenetic modifications integrated into the genome of individuals were shown to modulate gene expression and activity at enhancer and promoter domains, while genetic mutations were shown to alter sequence availability for methylation and histone binding. Fundamentally, alterations to the nuclear composition of the germline in response to environmental factors, ageing, diet and toxicant exposure have the potential to become hereditably transmitted. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: The environment influences the health and well-being of progeny by working through the germline to introduce spontaneous genetic mutations as well as a variety of epigenetic changes, including alterations in DNA methylation status and the post-translational modification of histones. In evolutionary terms, these changes create the phenotypic diversity that fuels the fires of natural selection. However, rather than being adaptive, such variation may also generate a plethora of pathological disease states ranging from dominant genetic disorders to neurological conditions, including spontaneous schizophrenia and autism.},

	abstract = {To review and assess the efficacy of laser photobiomodulation for cartilage defect in animal models of knee osteoarthritis (KOA). Medline, Web of Science, and EMBASE were searched. Studies were considered if the global quality score of cartilage were parallelly reported between laser and untreated control groups. The methodological quality of each study was assessed using a modified 10-item checklist. The effect size was estimated by standardized mean difference (SMD) and pooled based on the random-effects model. Stratified analysis and regression analysis were conducted to partition potential heterogeneity. An adjusted significant level of 0.01 was acceptable. Five hundred eight initial search recordings were identified, of which 14 studies (including 274 animals) were included for quantitative analysis. The global quality scores mostly weighted by the structural integrity and chondrocyte distribution were measured by different four scales including Histologic Histochemical Grading System (HHGS), Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI), Pineda, and Huang. There were considerable variances on laser parameters and irradiation time among those included studies. Overall, a moderate level of methodological qualities was determined. The synthesis results indicated that the SMD effect size was significantly larger in HHGS (z = 2.61, P = 0.01) and Huang (z = 4.90, P {\textless} 0.01) groups. Stratified by irradiance, SMD of low ({\textless} 1 W/cm(2)) but not high (≥ 1 W/cm(2)) level estimated significant difference (z = 5.62, P {\textless} 0.01). Meta-regression identified a significant association for SMDs and irradiation time (P {\textless} 0.01). Yet, Egger's test detected small study effect (P {\textless} 0.01). No individual study with significant variance was found in homogeneity tests. The results demonstrated the positive effect of laser photobiomodulation for cartilage defect in animal models of KOA under proper irradiance and adequate irradiation time.},

Thus, the purpose of the present study is to evaluate the preclinical animal studies of MSCs injection for KOA and to determine the evidence for a role for MSCs in further clinical trials. METHODS: A systematic search of KOA animal studies published through Aug 2017 was conducted using the PubMed, Embase and Web of science. Criteria for eligibility were animal studies assessing the therapeutic effects of MSCs intra-articular injection to animals with KOA. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed by the SYRCLE tool for assessing risk of bias in animal intervention studies. Descriptive synthesis was performed. Evidence quality was evaluated based on the Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (CERQual) tool. RESULTS: Twenty-three KOA animal studies were eligible for inclusion. According to the SYRCLE's tool, all included studies had high risk of bias. Between-study heterogeneity was substantial. The included studies varied in terms of species, modeling methods, MSCs origin, treatment timing, injections frequency, transplantation type and dose of MSCs. The following outcomes, gross morphology, histological analysis, immunohistochemical analysis, radiological evaluation or behavior analysis, were reported in the primary studies. For all outcomes, the evidence quality was low or very low. CONCLUSIONS: We do not have absolute confidence to recommend use MSCs injection for KOA clinical trials. Based on the internal and external validity of current animal studies, high quality experimental studies and efforts for effective translation from preclinical studies to clinical trials are still required.},

	abstract = {Fermented feed (FF) is recommended due to its high nutritional value and digestibility, but the effects on pig growth performance are inconsistent. This meta-analysis was conducted to quantify the effects of FF on pig growth performance. We systematically searched in PubMed and Web of Science for studies (published between January 1st, 2000 and December 20th, 2018) comparing the effects of FF supplementation with basal diet on pig growth performance. The main outcomes were average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and gain: feed ratio (G/F). Random-effects model was used to compute the weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI). The robustness of the pooled estimates was determined using sensitivity and subgroup analyses. Fermented materials included in the subgroup analysis were classified as ingredients (protein and energy sources) and additives (plant materials added at low levels). Of 1371 identified articles, 25 were eligible and were included in the meta-analysis (n=2391 pigs). Compared with the basal diet, FF supplementation improved ADG and G/F of weaned piglets (ADG: WMD=20.869 g/day, 95\% CI: 15.007-26.731, P{\textless}0.001; G/F: WMD=0.023, 95\% CI: 0.013 to 0.032, P{\textless}0.001), growing pigs (ADG: WMD=23.938 g/day, 95\% CI: 15.342-32.533, P{\textless}0.001; G/F: WMD=0.014, 95\% CI: 0.006 to 0.022, P=0.001), and finishing pigs (ADG: WMD=40.151 g/day, 95\% CI: 6.118-74.183, P=0.021; G/F: WMD=0.022, 95\% CI: 0.005 to 0.038, P=0.009), but had no effect on ADFI (P{\textgreater}0.05). The subgroup analyses revealed that fermented feed ingredients could boost the growth performance of weaned piglets and growing pigs. The fermented feed additives promoted growth at all stages. FF supplementation can enhance pig growth performance of which the enhancement in feed efficiency is due to the improvement in nutritional value and availability rather than feed intake.},

This study aimed to (i) quantitatively evaluate the effects of fermentation on nutritional components of feed stuffs; (ii) quantitatively evaluate the effects of FF on pig growth performance, digestibility, and meat quality; and (iii) explore the dose-effect relationship. From PubMed and Web of Science (searched range from January 1, 2000 to April 4, 2019), we collected 3,271 articles, of which 30 articles (3,562 pigs) were included in our meta-analysis. Our analysis revealed that fermentation significantly increased the CP content in feed (P {\textless} 0.05). For weaned piglets and growing pigs, FF significantly improved ADG, G:F, DM digestibility, N digestibility, and energy digestibility (P {\textless} 0.05). However, compared with the basal diet, FF had no significant effects on growth performance and nutrient digestibility in finishing pigs (P {\textgreater} 0.05). In the subgroup analyses, fermented ingredients increased the growth performance of weaned piglets and growing pigs, and fermented additives promoted the growth of pigs at all stages. The dose-effect analysis confirmed that the optimal doses of fermented ingredients and additives were 8\% and 0.15\%, respectively. Furthermore, FF had beneficial impacts on meat quality through increased lightness, redness, marbling and flavor and reduced drip loss (P {\textless} 0.05).

DATA SOURCES: Using "spinal cord injury", "resveratrol" and "animal experiment" as the main search terms, all studies on the treatment of spinal cord injury in rats by resveratrol were searched for in PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Science Direct, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, VIP, and SinoMed databases by computer. The search was conducted from their inception date to April 2017. No language restriction was used in the literature search. DATA SELECTION: The methodological quality of each study was assessed by the initial Stroke Therapy Academic Industry Roundtable recommendations. Two reviewers independently selected studies according to the title, abstract and full text. The risk of bias in the included studies was also evaluated. Meta-analyses were performed with Review Manager 5.3 software. OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurological function was assessed by the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale score, inclined plane score and Gale's motor function score. Molecular-biological analysis of antioxidative effects was conducted to determine superoxide dismutase levels, malondialdehyde levels, nitric oxide synthase activity, nitric oxide levels, xanthine oxidase and glutathione levels in spinal cord tissues. RESULTS: The methodological quality of the 12 included studies was poor. The results of meta-analysis showed that compared with the control group, resveratrol significantly increased the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scale scores after spinal cord injury (n = 300, mean difference (MD) = 3.85, 95\% confidence interval (CI) [2.10, 5.59], P {\textless} 0.0001). Compared with the control group, superoxide dismutase levels were significantly elevated (n = 138, standardized mean difference (SMD) = 5.22, 95\% CI [2.98, 7.45], P {\textless} 0.00001), but malondialdehyde levels were significantly diminished (n = 84, SMD = -3.64, 95\% CI [-5.84, -1.43], P = 0.001) in the spinal cord of the resveratrol treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: Resveratrol promoted neurological recovery and exerted antioxidative effects in rat models of spinal cord injury. The limited quality of the included studies reduces the application of this meta-analysis. Therefore, more high-quality studies are needed to provide more rigorous and objective evidence for the pre-clinical treatment of spinal cord injury.},

The objective of this study was to systematically review the evidence and investigate how thedifferences in schedules influence titres over time. METHODS: Four databaseswere searched from inception to January 2020 for rabies PrEP and PEP studies. Adose-response meta-analysis was utilised to pool geometric mean titres (GMT) over time. Subgroup analyses by route of administration, age group, and schedule were conducted. RESULTS: 80 studies met the inclusion criteria and contributed with 191 datasets and 12,413 participants. Both intradermal (ID) and intramuscular (IM) PrEP/PEP produce adequate GMTs. Significantly lower GMT levels were achieved in older ({\textgreater}50yrs) compared to younger ({\textless}50yrs) participants. Short 1-week schedules were as effective as longer schedules that can take between 3 and 12 weeks to complete. CONCLUSIONS: Several effective ID and IM schedules were identified, the selection of a schedule should take into account the patient's needs, costs, availability to return for subsequent doses, and the time required to complete the schedule.

This review aims to examine the potential molecular mechanisms through which GH-related signaling modulates sensory hypersensitivity in rodents, the clinical pharmacology of GH, and the clinical evidence of GH treatment for several common pain syndromes. METHODS: A search was conducted using the PUBMED/MEDLINE database, Scopus, and the Cochrane library for all reports published in English on GH in pain management from inception through May 2018. A critical review was performed on the mechanisms of GH-related signaling and the pharmacology of GH. The levels of clinical evidence and implications for recommendations of all of the included studies were graded. RESULTS: The search yielded 379 articles, of which 201 articles were deemed irrelevant by reading the titles. There were 53 reports deemed relevant after reading abstracts. All of these 53 articles were retrieved for the analysis and discussion. CONCLUSIONS: Dysfunction of the GH/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)/ghrelin axis was linked to hyperalgesia and several common clinical pain syndromes. Low levels of GH and IGF-1 were linked to pain hypersensitivity, whereas ghrelin appeared to provide analgesic effects. Pretreatment of GH reversed mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in an animal model of inflammatory pain. Clinical trials support GH treatment in a subgroup of patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (level of evidence: 1B+) or chronic lower back pain syndrome (level of evidence: 2C+).},

SEARCH METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Springer, and Cochrane databases were searched from January 2000 to October 2018 for relevant articles. SELECTION CRITERIA: Only published studies focusing on the relationship between BBR and various cancers in vivo were qualified. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each study, and any disagreement was resolved by discussion or by involving a third assessor. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies from 2000 to 2018, focusing on various cancer types, including breast cancer, liver cancer, colorectal cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lung cancer, gastric cancer, neuroepithelial cancer, endometrial carcinoma, esophageal cancer, tongue cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, and sarcoma were included. Overall, BBR reduced tumor volume (SMD =3.72, 95\% CI: 2.89, 4.56, Z = 8.73, p {\textless} 0.00001) and tumor weight (SMD =2.35, 95\% CI: 1.51, 3.19, Z = 5.50, p {\textless} 0.00001) in a linear The dose-response relationship (Pearson r = - 0.6717, p {\textless} 0.0001 in tumor volume analysis; Pearson r = - 0.7704, p {\textless} 0.0005 in tumor weight analysis). BBR inhibited angiogenesis in tumor tissues (SMD = 4.29, 95\% CI: 2.14, 6.44, Z = 3.92, p {\textless} 0.00001), but it had no significant effect on the body weight of experimental animals (SMD = 0.11, 95\% CI: - 0.70, 0.92, Z = 0.27, p = 0.78). Publication bias was not detected. CONCLUSION: BBR exerted anti-tumor effects in a variety of tumors in vivo, especially breast cancer and lung cancer, and the evidence was still insufficient in colorectal cancer and gastric cancer.},

	abstract = {Livestock products, such as dairy and beef, are increasingly regarded as resource intensive and concerns are raised about animal welfare and environmental sustainability. As a result, consumer awareness of these issues has led to an increasing demand for products with high quality credence attributes (CAs) that cannot be directly experienced or identified. A number of empirical studies have attempted to estimate consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for CAs, which represents the additional value placed on the benefits that they derive from those products. However, there are significant differences in these WTP estimates, mainly because both consumers' perceptions of CAs and the conditions of the studies vary. We conduct a meta-analysis to examine consumers' WTP for different CAs of livestock products based on a systematic review of relevant studies. Meta-regression models are used to control for the heterogeneity of WTP estimates and investigate factors that affect the estimation of WTP. Overall 555 estimates derived from 94 papers reporting WTP are included in this study. Meta-regression results establish the presence of systematic WTP variation associated with types of products, CAs, and locations, though also indicate that WTP is subject to systematic variation associated with study methodology.},

METHODS: Relevant articles were identified in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases using a search time up to January 2019. Generalized least-squares trend estimations and restricted cubic spline regression models were used for analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-eight articles were included in the analysis. When comparing the highest with the lowest category of meat intake, the summary relative risk of T2D was 1.33 (95\% CI: 1.16-1.52) for total meat, 1.22 (95\% CI: 1.16-1.28) for red meat, 1.25 (95\% CI: 1.13-1.37) for processed meat, 1.00 (95\% CI: 0.93-1.07) for poultry and 1.01 (95\% CI: 0.93-1.10) for fish. In the dose-response analysis, each additional 100g/day of total and red meat, and 50g/day of processed meat, were found to be associated with a 36\% (95\% CI: 1.23-1.49), 31\% (95\% CI: 1.19-1.45) and 46\% (95\% CI: 1.26-1.69) increased risk of T2D, respectively. In addition, there was evidence of a non-linear dose-response association between processed meat and T2D (P=0.004), with the risk increasing by 30\% with increasing intakes up to 30g/day. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis has shown a linear dose-response relationship between total meat, red meat and processed meat intakes and T2D risk. In addition, a non-linear relationship of intake of processed meat with risk of T2D was detected.},

	abstract = {Light intensity is an important aspect for broiler production. However, previous results do not provide a solid scientific basis for quantifying the response of broilers to light intensity. This study performed a meta-analysis to model the response of broilers to 0.1-200 lux of light intensity. Meta-analysis was used to integrate smaller studies and increase the statistical power over that of any single study and explore new hypotheses. The results indicated that light intensity {\textless}5 lux caused welfare concern (P {\textless} 0.05) and light intensity {\textless}1 lux induced productivity loss of broiler (P {\textless} 0.05), whereas greater level of light intensity {\textgreater}10 lux led to increased mortality (P {\textless} 0.01) and decreased uniformity (P {\textless} 0.05). Meta-regression showed that 30-200 lux light intensity was negatively related to BW (P = 0.047) and feed intake change (P = 0.054), whereas a quadratic relationship was observed between feed conversion ratio change and 50-180 lux light intensity (R2 = 0.95). In addition, the majority of carcass characteristics (abdominal fat weight and wing weight) and metabolic indicators (K+, Ca2+, and T3) were affected by light intensity {\textgreater}5 lux. To conclude, this meta-analysis based on published data quantitatively identified that 5 lux of light intensity during grow-out period should be the minimum level to maintain a well productivity and welfare of broiler chickens.},

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) was widely used in the treatment of LE and has been shown to relieve the pain and functional impairment (loss of grip strength) caused by tennis elbow. However, the evidence with regard to whether ESWT has better clinical efficacy over other method is not clear. The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of ESWT with other techniques in the treatment of LE. METHODS: Literature searches of PubMed, OVID, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched up to 30(th) June, 2019. Only RCTs comparing ESWT with other methods for LE were included. Data collection and extraction, quality assessment, and data analyses were performed according to the Cochrane standards. RESULTS: A total of 13 articles with 1035 patients were included. Of which, 501 underwent ESWT and 534 underwent other methods. The result of meta-analysis showed that pooled VAS (P = 0.0004) and grip strength (P {\textless} 0.00001) were better in the ESWT group. CONCLUSION: Based on the existing clinical evidence, extracorporeal shock wave therapy can effectively relieve the pain and functional impairment (loss of grip strength) caused by tennis elbow, with better overall safety than several other methods. However, owing to the limited quality and quantity of the included studies, more high-quality RCTs are needed to support the trend towards better functional outcomes with ESWT.},

RESULTS: We included 12 studies, involving 488,986 participants (52.3\% female, mean age 56.1 years), in our systematic review. The mean follow-up duration was 8.7 ± 6.3 years. Pet ownership had no association with adjusted all-cause mortality (odds ratio, OR = 1.01, 95\% confidence interval, CI [0.94, 1.08], I2 = 76\%), adjusted CV mortality (OR = 0.87, 95\% CI [0.75, 1.00], I2 = 72\%), or risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (OR = 0.87, 95\% CI [0.72, 1.05], I2 = 73\%), myocardial infarction (MI) (OR = 0.99, 95\% CI [0.97, 1.01], I2 = 0\%), or stroke (OR = 0.99, 95\% CI [0.98, 1.01], I2 = 0\%). However, subgroup analysis showed that pet ownership was associated with a lower adjusted CV mortality in the general population (OR = 0.93, 95\% CI [0.86, 0.99], I2 = 27\%) than in CVD patients. In patients with established CVD, pet ownership was associated with a lower adjusted CVD risk (OR = 0.71, 95\% CI [0.60, 0.84], I2 = 0\%). CONCLUSION: Pet ownership is not associated with adjusted all-cause or CV mortality, or risk of CVD, MI, or stroke, but it is associated with a lower adjusted CV mortality in the general population and a lower CVD risk in patients with established CVD.},

This review seeks to analyze the results of published studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of malaria RDTs in detecting Pk, Pm, and Po monoinfections. Method. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CENTRAL databases were systematically searched to identify studies that reported the performance of RDTs in detecting Pk, Pm, and Po monoinfections. Result. Among 40 studies included in the review, 3 reported on Pk, 8 on Pm, 5 on Po, 1 on Pk and Pm, and 23 on Pm and Po infections. In the meta-analysis, estimates of sensitivities of RDTs in detecting Pk infections ranged 2\%-48\%. Test performances for Pm and Po infections were less accurate and highly heterogeneous, mainly because of the small number of samples tested. Conclusion. Limited data available suggest that malaria RDTs show suboptimal performance for detecting Pk, Pm, and Po infections. New improved RDTs and appropriately designed cross-sectional studies to demonstrate the usefulness of RDTs in the detection of neglected Plasmodium species are urgently needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinically, severe burns remain one of the most challenging issues, but an ideal treatment is yet absent. Our purpose is to compare the efficacy of stem cell therapy in a preclinical model of burn wound healing. METHODS: Research reports on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for burn wound healing were retrieved from 5 databases: PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The primary outcomes reported in this article include the un-healing rate of the wound area, the closure rate, and the wound area. Secondary outcomes included CD-31, vascular density, interleukin (IL)-10, thickness of eschar tissue, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and white blood cell count. Finally, a subgroup analysis was conducted to explore heterogeneity that potentially impacted the primary outcomes. A fixed-effects model with a 95\% confidence interval (CI) was performed when no significant heterogeneity existed. Otherwise, a random-effects model was used. All data analysis was conducted by using Engauge Digitizer 10.8 and R software. RESULTS: Twenty eligible articles were finally included in the analysis. Stem cell therapy greatly improved the closure rate (2.00, 95\% CI 0.52 to 3.48, p = 0.008) and compromised the wound area (- 2.36; 95\% CI - 4.90 to 0.18; p = 0.069) rather than the un-healing rate of the wound area (- 11.10, 95\% CI - 32.97 to 10.78, p = 0.320). Though p was 0.069, there was a trend toward shrinkage of the burn wound area after stem cell therapy. Vascular density (4.69; 95\% CI 0.06 to 9.31; p = 0.047) and thickness of eschar tissue (6.56, 95\% CI 1.15 to 11.98, p = 0.017) were also discovered to be significantly improved in the burn site of stem cell-treated animals. Moreover, we observed that animals in the stem cell group had an increased white blood cell count (0.84, 95\% CI 0.01 to 1.66, p = 0.047) 5 days post treatment. Other indicators, such as VEGF (p = 0.381), CD-31 (p = 0.335) and IL-10 (p = 0.567), were not significantly impacted. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited data from preclinical trials, this meta-analysis suggests that stem cell therapy is curative in decreasing the burn wound area and provides some insights into future clinical studies of stem cell therapy for burns.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of MK-801 and its effect on lesion volume in rat models of acute brain injury. DATA SOURCES: Key terms were "stroke", "brain diseases", "brain injuries", "brain hemorrhage, traumatic", "acute brain injury", "dizocilpine maleate", "dizocilpine", "MK-801", "MK801", "rat", "rats", "rattus" and "murine". PubMed, Cochrane library, EMBASE, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang database, the VIP Journal Integration Platform (VJIP) and SinoMed databases were searched from their inception dates to March 2018. DATA SELECTION: Studies were selected if they reported the effects of MK-801 in experimental acute brain injury. Two investigators independently conducted literature screening, data extraction, and methodological quality assessments. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes included lesion volume and brain edema. The secondary outcomes included behavioral assessments with the Bederson neurological grading system and the water maze test 24 hours after brain injury. RESULTS: A total of 52 studies with 2530 samples were included in the systematic review. Seventeen of these studies had a high methodological quality. Overall, the lesion volume (34 studies, n = 966, MD = -58.31, 95\% CI: -66.55 to -50.07; P {\textless} 0.00001) and degree of cerebral edema (5 studies, n = 75, MD = -1.21, 95\% CI: -1.50 to -0.91; P {\textless} 0.00001) were significantly decreased in the MK-801 group compared with the control group. MK-801 improved spatial cognition assessed with the water maze test (2 studies, n = 60, MD = -10.88, 95\% CI: -20.75 to -1.00; P = 0.03) and neurological function 24 hours after brain injury (11 studies, n = 335, MD = -1.04, 95\% CI: -1.47 to -0.60; P {\textless} 0.00001). Subgroup analysis suggested an association of reduction in lesion volume with various injury models (34 studies, n = 966, MD = -58.31, 95\% CI: -66.55 to -50.07; P = 0.004). Further network analysis showed that 0-1 mg/kg MK-801 may be the optimal dose for treatment in the middle cerebral artery occlusion animal model. CONCLUSION: MK-801 effectively reduces brain lesion volume and the degree of cerebral edema in rat models of experimental acute brain injury, providing a good neuroprotective effect. Additionally, MK-801 has a good safety profile, and its mechanism of action is well known. Thus, MK-801 may be suitable for future clinical trials and applications.},

	abstract = {Canines are proven reservoir hosts of Leishmania infantum, the causative agent of human zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis, and therefore domestic dogs play a central role in transmitting the disease to humans. Studies on the effect of insecticide-impregnated dog collars for controlling canine visceral leishmaniasis (CanL) have been increasing; however, meta-analysis has not been conducted. This study assessed the effectiveness of insecticide-impregnated dog collars for preventing CanL. We searched (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Ovid Medline(R), and Cochrane library), from inception until 2 May 2020. Two authors independently performed articles screening and data extraction. We applied the RoB 2.0 tool to evaluate the risk of bias in randomized trials, while the ROBINS-I tool was used for non-randomized trials. I-squared statistics(I2) and funnel plot and Egger's test, respectively, were used to assesses heterogeneity between studies and publication bias. Relative Risk (RR) and 95\% Confidence Interval (CI) were calculated using the random-effects model in Stata 14 software. Out of 242 citations identified, 14 studies comprising 3786 collared dogs and 3428 uncollared dogs were eligible for meta-analysis. The use of deltamethrin-impregnated dog collars(DMC) showed an overall effectiveness of 54\% (95\%CI: 35-65\%, I2 = 63.2\%, P = 0.002) in decreasing incidence of CanL, while 10\% imidacloprid and 4.5\% flumethrin collars provided an overall effectiveness of 90\% (95\%CI: 80-96\%, I2 = 0.0\%, P = 0.376). DMC efficacy stratified by follow-up duration was estimated to be 58\% (RR = 0.42, 95\%CI: 0.20-0.87), 54\% (RR = 0.46, 95\%CI: 0.31-0.68), 53\% (RR = 0.47, 95\%CI: 0.29-0.82) for follow-up periods of 5 to 6 months, 1 year and 2 years, respectively. The current evidence indicates that using insecticide-impregnated dog collars can reduce the risk of CanL caused by L. infantum. Therefore, insecticide-impregnated dog collars could be a viable alternative for inclusion as a public health measure for controlling CanL.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is one of the common neurological illnesses which affects millions of individuals globally. Although the majority of epileptic patients have a good response for the currently available antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), about 30-40\% of epileptic patients are developing resistance. In addition to low safety profiles of most of existing AEDs, there is no AED available for curative or disease-modifying actions for epilepsy so far. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review is intended to evaluate the effect of metformin in acute and chronic animal models of an epileptic seizure. METHODS: We searched PubMed, SCOPUS, Sciences Direct, and grey literature in order to explore articles published in English from January 2010 to November 2018, using key terms "epilepsy," "seizure," "metformin," "oral hypoglycemic agents," and "oral antidiabetic drugs". The qualities of all the included articles were assessed according to the Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies (CAMARADES). RESULTS: Out of six hundred fifty original articles retrieved, eleven of them fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included for final qualitative analysis. In these studies, metformin showed to control seizure attacks by attenuating seizure generation, delaying the onset of epilepsy, reducing hippocampal neuronal loss, and averting cognitive impairments in both acute and chronic models of an epileptic seizure. The possible mechanisms for its antiseizure or antiepileptic action might be due to activation of AMPK, antiapoptotic, antineuroinflammatory, and antioxidant properties, which possibly modify disease progression through affecting epileptogenesis. CONCLUSION: This review revealed the benefits of metformin in alleviating symptoms of epileptic seizure and modifying different cellular and molecular changes that affect the natural history of the disease in addition to its good safety profile.},

Major emission activities were identified and synthesised into a cradle-to-cooked-edible-meat lifecycle system. 270 emission factors were identified from publications and taken as baselines. 67\% baseline evaluation boundaries stopped at farm-gate, only 3\% at home/restaurants. Baseline emission gaps were identified by comparing baseline evaluation systems against the synthesised system. Emission factors for major activities were identified from publications and mean values were used to fill emission gaps in order to obtain the cradle-to-cooked-edible-meat emission factors, which were then grouped to obtain a mean cradle-to-cooked-edible-meat emission factor for each meat type. Mean emission factors (kg CO$_{\textrm{2}}$-eq/kg) for adjusted cradle-to-cooked-edible-meats were: Bovine 61.3 (n=124), Ovine 61.2 (n=38), Pig 15.8 (n=56) and Poultry 9.4 (n=52), which are significantly higher than the adjusted means for carcass at regional-distribution-centre: Bovine 23.9 (n=118), Ovine 23.3 (n=9), Pig 5.0 (n=51) and Poultry 3.6 (n=45); or the adjusted means for saleable meat at retail: Bovine 32.3 (n=122), Ovine 31.2 (n=36), Pig 7.9 (54), and Poultry 4.2 (n=50). This study confirmed current meat emission evaluations reflect only a fraction of dietary impacts. Emission factors for cooked-edible-meat could be three times the amount of meat commodities at farm-gate. Emission factors vary significantly within and between meat types.},

	abstract = {Background: Strongyloidiasis is a gastrointestinal infection caused by the parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercoralis. It is estimated to infect up to 370 million people globally and is predominately found in tropical and subtropical areas of socioeconomic disadvantage. Main body: This systematic literature review identified studies published in the last ten years on the risk factors, diagnosis, prevalence and/or clinical outcomes of strongyloidiasis in Ethiopia. The prevalence of S. stercoralis ranged from 0.2 to 11.1\% in adults, 0.3\% to 20.7\% in children, 1.5\% to 17.3\% in HIV positive adults and 5\% in HIV positive children. The identified studies primarily used microscopy based techniques that potentially underestimated the prevalence four fold compared with serology and PCR. Strongyloidiasis in children presents a particularly significant issue in Ethiopia as children often presented with anemia, which is associated with impaired mental and cognitive development. The most significant risk factor for strongyloidiasis was HIV status and although other risk factors were identified for helminth infections, none were statistically significant for S. stercoralis specifically. Several studies detected S. stercoralis in dogs and non-biting cyclorrhaphan flies. However, future research is needed to explore the role of these reservoirs in disease transmission. Conclusions: This review demonstrated that strongyloidiasis is an overlooked and neglected disease in Ethiopia. There is a need for a systematic approach using a combination of molecular and serology based diagnostic methods to ascertain the true incidence and burden of strongyloidiasis in Ethiopia. Further research is also needed to break the cycle of transmission by identifying environmental reservoirs, risk factors and exploring the potential for zoonotic transfer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biomonitoring studies indicate a trend towards increased human exposure to diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), a replacement for dibutyl phthalate (DBP). Recent reviews have found DIBP to be a male reproductive toxicant, but have not evaluated other hazards of DIBP exposure. OBJECTIVE: To inform chemical risk assessment, we performed a systematic review to identify and characterize outcomes within six broad hazard categories (male reproductive, female reproductive, developmental, liver, kidney, and cancer) following exposure of nonhuman mammalian animals to DIBP or the primary metabolite, monoisobutyl phthalate (MIBP). METHODS: A literature search was conducted in four online scientific databases [PubMed, Web of Science, Toxline, and Toxic Substances Control Act Test Submissions 2.0 (TSCATS2)], and augmented by review of regulatory sources as well as forward and backward searches. Studies were identified for inclusion based on defined PECO (Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome) criteria. Studies were evaluated using criteria defined a priori for reporting quality, risk of bias, and sensitivity using a domain-based approach. Evidence was synthesized by outcome and life stage of exposure, and strength of evidence was summarized into categories of robust, moderate, slight, indeterminate, or compelling evidence of no effect, using a structured framework. RESULTS: Nineteen toxicological studies in rats or mice met the inclusion criteria. There was robust evidence that DIBP causes male reproductive toxicity. Male rats and mice exposed to DIBP during gestation had decreased testosterone and adverse effects on sperm or testicular histology, with additional phthalate syndrome effects observed in male rats. There was also evidence of androgen-dependent and -independent male reproductive effects in rats and mice following peripubertal or young adult exposure to DIBP or MIBP, but confidence was reduced because of concerns over risk of bias and sensitivity in the available studies. There was also robust evidence that DIBP causes developmental toxicity; specifically, increased post-implantation loss and decreased pre- and postnatal growth. For other hazards, evidence was limited by the small number of studies, experimental designs that were suboptimal for evaluating outcomes, and study evaluation concerns such as incomplete reporting of methods and results. There was slight evidence for female reproductive toxicity and effects on liver, and indeterminate evidence for effects on kidney and cancer. CONCLUSION: Results support DIBP as a children's health concern and indicate that male reproductive and developmental toxicities are hazards of DIBP exposure, with some evidence for female reproductive and liver toxicity. Data gaps include the need for more studies on male reproductive effects following postnatal and adult exposure, and studies to characterize potential hormonal mechanisms in females.},

The role that animal hosts play in disease transmission is still understudied and researchers wish to find suitable animal models for fundamental research and drug discovery. In this systematic review, we aimed to compile and discuss all articles that describe experimental or natural infections with SARS-CoV-2, from the initial discovery of the virus in December 2019 through to October 2020. We systematically searched four databases (Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct and Web of Science). The following data were extracted from the included studies: type of infection (natural or experimental), age, sample numbers, dose, route of inoculation, viral replication, detection method, clinical symptoms and transmission. Fifty-four studies were included, of which 34 were conducted on animal reservoirs (naturally or experimentally infected), and 20 involved models for testing vaccines and therapeutics. Our search revealed that Rousettus aegyptiacus (fruit bats), pangolins, felines, mink, ferrets and rabbits were all susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, while dogs were weakly susceptible and pigs, poultry, and tree shrews were not. In addition, virus replication in mice, mink, hamsters and ferrets resembled subclinical human infection, so these animals might serve as useful models for future studies to evaluate vaccines or antiviral agents and to study host-pathogen interactions. Our review comprehensively summarized current evidence on SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals and their usefulness as models for studying vaccines and antiviral drugs. Our findings may direct future studies for vaccine development, antiviral drugs and therapeutic agents to manage SARS-CoV-2-caused diseases.},

Analyses show that combination therapy in comparison with the scaffold group alone (SMD 2.00, 95\% CI 1.53-2.46, p {\textless} 0.0001), the MSCs alone (SMD 1.58, 95\% CI 0.84-2.31, p {\textless} 0.0001), and the nontreated group (SMD 3.52, 95\% CI 2.84-4.20, p {\textless} 0.0001) significantly improved motor function recovery. Co-administration of MSCs + scaffolds only in the acute phase of injury (during the first 3 days after injury) leads to a significant recovery compared to scaffold alone (SMD 2.18, p {\textless} 0.0001). In addition, the cotransplantation of scaffolds with bone marrow-derived MSCs (SMD 1.99, p {\textless} 0.0001) and umbilical cord-derived MSCs (SMD 1.50, p = 0.001) also improved motor function following SCI. CONCLUSIONS: The findings showed that scaffolds + MSCs is more effective than scaffolds and MSCs alone in improving motor function following SCI in animal models, when used in the acute phase of injury.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There is still controversy about the effect of early hypothermia on the outcome of spinal cord injury (SCI). The aim of this review article is to investigate the effect of local or general hypothermia on improving the locomotion after traumatic SCI. METHODS: Electronic databases (Medline and Embase) were searched from inception until May 7, 2018. Two independent reviewers screened and summarized the relevant experimental studies on hypothermia efficacy in traumatic SCI. The data were analyzed and the findings were presented as pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI). RESULTS: 20 papers containing 30 separate experiments were included in meta-analysis. The onset of hypothermia varied between 0 and 240 minutes after SCI. Administration of hypothermia has a positive effect on locomotion following SCI (SMD=0.56 95\% CI: 0.18-0.95, p=0.004). Subgroup analysis showed that general hypothermia improves locomotion recovery (SMD =0.89, 95\% CI: 0.42 to 1.36; p {\textless}0.0001), while local hypothermia does not have a significant effect on motor recovery (SMD=0.20, 95 \% CI: -0.36-0.76, p=0.478). In addition, general hypothermia was found to affect motor recovery only if its duration was between 2 and 8 hours (SMD=0.89; p{\textless}0.0001) and the target temperature for induction of hypothermia was between 32 and 35° C (SMD=0.83; p{\textless}0.0001). CONCLUSION: We found that general hypothermia improves locomotion after SCI in rats. Duration of induction and the target temperature are two essential considerations for general therapeutic hypothermia.},

	abstract = {Zoonotic bacterial infections are a health hazard for people who are in regular contact with livestock at the farm level. Improved biosecurity can limit zoonotic pathogen transmission within farms. The aim of this review was to summarize the effectiveness of farm-level biosecurity interventions in reducing bacterial transmission from animals to people who lived, worked in or visited farms. A systematic literature review was conducted using Embase, Ovid Medline and Agris databases, which were searched on 7(th) of July 2019, limited to English language papers but with no time exclusion criteria. A narrative synthesis was undertaken utilizing the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination approach, reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Risk of bias within and across the included studies was performed using established checklists. Out of 869 studies retrieved through database searches, 11 studies were selected. In addition, three studies were found through study reference lists. Fourteen studies were therefore included in this review. Biosecurity interventions were grouped into five categories: hand washing, sanitization and hygienic measures (six studies); personal protective equipment (five studies); vaccination (two studies); other interventions (e.g. air ventilation flap) (four studies); and routine farm activities (two studies). Across studies that investigated odds of human colonization or infection (three studies), odds were seen to both be increased and decreased through use of tested biosecurity measures. Large confidence intervals that often crossed the threshold of an odds ratio equal to 1 were found. Most of the studies' overall risk of bias was 'medium risk' (11 studies), with selection bias domains generally being scored 'medium risk.' Biosecurity interventions are potentially beneficial in reducing bacterial transmission from animals to humans. However, more high-quality evidence is needed to increase certainty in which interventions, in which contexts, are most effective from the human health perspective.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) is a highly prevalent symptom, which afflicts vast majority of patients who suffer from cancer. The current treatment options failed to achieve satisfactory effect and the side effects were prominent. Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of animal demonstrate the benefit of acupuncture for CIBP. We sought to determine if the pooled data from available RCTs supports the use of acupuncture for CIBP. METHODS: A literature search for randomized controlled trials was conducted in six electronic databases from inception to May 31, 2019. Meta-analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.3 software; the publication bias was assessed by Stata 12.0 software. We used random effects model for pooling data because heterogeneity is absolute among studies to some extent. RESULTS: Twenty-four trials were included in the review, of which 12 trials provided detailed data for meta-analyses. Preliminary evidence indicates that compared to wait list/sham group, acupuncture was effective on increasing paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and paw withdrawal latency (PWL). Compared to medicine, acupuncture was less effective on PWT, but as effective as medicine on PWL. Acupuncture can reinforce medicine's effect on PWT and PWL. Compared to the control group, acupuncture was superior to increase body weight (BW), decrease spinal cord glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Furthermore, some studies showed acupuncture delay or partially reverse morphine tolerance. Three studies found acupuncture has no effect on PWT, but 2 of them found acupuncture could enhance small dose of Celebrex's effect on CIBP. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture was superior to wait list/sham acupuncture on increasing PWT and has no less effect on increasing PWL compared to medicine; acupuncture improved the efficacy of drugs, increased the CIBP animals' body weight, and decreased their spinal cord GFAP and IL-1β. High-quality studies are necessary to confirm the results.},

	abstract = {The Wilms tumor-1 (WT1) protein is an important regulator of malignant hematopoiesis and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recently special attention has been paid to the relationship of the WT1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs16754 with AML risk and outcome, but the conflicting results made it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. In the present study, we systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis of existing evidence. We searched Embase, Pubmed, Web of Science, Medline, Cochrane Library, Wanfang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases using predefined search methodology for relevant studies. We pooled odd ratio (OR) with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) to evaluate the association between SNP rs16754 and AML risk. In addition, we analyzed hazard ratio (HR) with 95\% CI for overall survive, relapse-free survival, and disease-free survival. Q-statistic was used to assess the homogeneity and Egger test was used to evaluate publication bias. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria for analysis. The results of fixed-effect meta-analyses revealed no association between SNP rs16754 and AML risk (AA + GA vs GG: OR = 0.92, 95\% CI: 0.71-1.19, P = .518; AA vs GA + GG: OR = 1.23, 95\% CI: 0.86-1.76, P = .262; AA vs GG: OR = 1.05, 95\% CI: 0.68-1.63, P = .820; AG vs AA: OR = 0.77, 95\% CI: 0.53-1.13, P = .186; AG vs GG: OR = 0.89, 95\% CI: 0.68-1.16, P = .376). In subgroup analysis by race, age, and disease type, we did not find any significant association. However, the presence of rs16754 GA/GG genotype was associated with improved overall survive (HR = 0.48, 95\% CI: 0.26-0.91, P = .024) and relapse-free survival (HR = 0.82, 95\% CI: 0.68-1.00, P = .048) compared with the rs16754 AA. In summary, the WT1 SNP rs16754 was not associated with AML risk, but it had a significant impact on clinical outcome in AML patients.},

The optimal timing of introduction of food allergens, including cow's milk (CM), is not known. This study aims to systematically review the evidence describing the effects of timing of CM or cow's milk formula (CMF) introduction to the infant diet on the development of atopic diseases during childhood. Pubmed, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, and CNKI were searched through May 30, 2019. Study screening and data extraction by two reviewers followed the PRISMA statement. Data were extracted independently in duplicate, and meta-analyses were performed by pooling unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio (OR) separately. Heterogeneity was explored using I(2) and publication bias by funnel plots and Begg's tests. In total, 45 studies from 20 countries were included. Meta-analyses using adjusted data showed that no associations were observed between early introduction of CM or CMF and the risk of asthma ({\textless} 4 vs. ≥ 4 months: OR 1.16, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.89, 1.51), wheeze ({\textless} 6 vs. ≥ 6 months: OR 1.15, 95\% CI 0.85, 1.56), and eczema or atopic dermatitis ({\textless} 6 vs. ≥ 6 months: OR 0.96, 95\% CI 0.65, 1.41). Overall, quite little high-quality evidence was identified to allow for definitive conclusions on the association between early CM or CMF introduction and risk of allergic diseases. Our meta-analysis on this topic highlights the specific gaps in information for public recommendations regarding CM or CMF feeding practice in an early stage of life, particularly before 3 months of age.},

This study aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence of HEV among the general population, occupational population and swine in mainland China and its risk factors based on a systematic review and meta-analysis. Systematic search from EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and several Chinese databases, such as Wanfang (WF) Data, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP) and SINOMED, was searched from inception up to 25 April 2018. The overall seroprevalence of HEV and its corresponding 95\% confidence interval (CI) as well as the correlation coefficients between different groups were estimated using stata 12.0 and r-3.4.1 software. Potential sources of heterogeneity were explored using subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Twenty-eight studies with 57,274 participants (including human and swine) were included. The seroprevalence of anti-HEV immunoglobulin G (IgG) among the general population, occupational population and swine was 27.3\% (95\% CI: 22.4-32.2), 47.4\% (95\% CI: 40.1-54.8) and 66.4\% (95\% CI: 61.7-71.1), respectively. The overall prevalence of IgM among the general population was 1.8\% (95\% CI: 0.7-2.9). The odds ratio for the occupational population, as compared to the general population, was 2.63. The highest anti-HEV IgG prevalence (59\%) was observed in East China, whereas the lowest (34.8\%) was noted in Northeast and North China. In the occupational population, the highest prevalence (77.0\%) was observed among swine vendors. Seven studies included 30,392 participants (humans and swine); the correlation coefficient for the prevalence of anti-HEV IgG between the professional population and adult pigs was 0.88. Sensitivity analyses showed that the stability of results was not considered significant. This research found that HEV is common in China, and contact with pork or other pig products may be an important mode of HEV transmission.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Despite recent advances in depression treatment, many patients still do not respond to serial conventional therapies and are considered "treatment resistant." Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has therapeutic potential in this context. This comprehensive review of recent studies of DBS for depression in animal models identifies potential biomarkers for improving therapeutic efficacy and predictability of conventional DBS to aid future development of closed-loop control of DBS system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search was performed in Pubmed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Review using relevant keywords. In overall, 56 animal studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Outcomes were divided into biochemical/physiological, electrophysiological, and behavioral categories. Promising biomarkers include biochemical assays (in particular, microdialysis and electrochemical measurements), which provide real-time results in awake animals. Electrophysiological tests, showing changes at both the target site and downstream structures also revealed characteristic changes at several anatomic targets (such as the medial prefrontal cortex and locus coeruleus). However, the substantial range of models and DBS targets limits the ability to draw generalizable conclusions in animal behavioral models. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, DBS is a promising therapeutic modality for treatment-resistant depression. Different outcomes have been used to assess its efficacy in animal studies. From the review, electrophysiological and biochemical markers appear to offer the greatest potential as biomarkers for depression. However, to develop closed-loop DBS for depression, additional preclinical and clinical studies with a focus on identifying reliable, safe, and effective biomarkers are warranted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dog-assisted therapy (DAT) is a non-pharmacological intervention based on the interaction between patients and dogs, which has been proposed to help adults with dementia. However, evidence to support it is lacking. Thus, we aim to evaluate the effects of DAT on this population and to assess the certainty of the evidence of the RCTs estimates. METHODS: A systematic search was performed. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental (QE) controlled studies published up to March 2018, which evaluated the beneficial and deleterious effects of DAT in adults with dementia. Mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) and their 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) were calculated and random effects meta-analyses were performed. Certainty of evidence was assessed for RCTs estimates using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The study protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018090434). RESULTS: Ten studies (six RCTs and four QE controlled studies) were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analysis of RCTs showed no effect of DAT in daily life activities (SMD: 0.16; 95\% CI: -0.80 to 1.12), depression (SMD: -0.45; 95\% CI: -2.81 to 1.91), agitation (SDM: -1.12; 95\% CI: -2.67 to 0.43), quality of life (SDM: 0.16; 95\% CI: -0.41 to 0.73), and cognitive impairment (SDM: -0.52; 95\% CI: -1.33 to 0.30), but it found a beneficial effect in apathy (1 study, n = 37, MD: 1.81; 95\% CI: 1.26 to 2.36). All outcomes had a very low certainty of evidence according to GRADE methodology. CONCLUSIONS: RCTs evidence of very low certainty suggests that, in adults with dementia, DAT has no effect in daily life activities, depression, agitation, quality of life, and cognitive impairment, although one small study found an apparent beneficial effect in apathy. More well-designed and correctly reported studies are needed in order to provide a conclusion. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CRD42018090434 (PROSPERO).},

	abstract = {The prenatal development of cattle has influence on productive performance throughout postnatal life. The number of muscle and fat cells that the animal will have throughout its life is determined in the foetal stage and is influenced by nutrition of the pregnant cow. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of different energy levels (total digestible nutrient, TDN) and crude protein (CP) supplied to pregnant cows on foetal weight at 4 (FW4) and 8 months (FW8) and calf birth weight (CBW). Four studies and six trials involving 170 animals were assessed for FW4; four studies, four trials and 156 animals for FW8 and 48 studies, 125 trials and 9053 animals for CBW. High heterogeneity across studies was presented in FW4 (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=94.4\%), FW8 (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=91.08\%) and CBW (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=96.9\%). Dietary TDN and CP levels did not influence FW4. The FW8 was reduced by 2.24 kg when cows were fed 100\% of their CP and TDN requirements (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=0\%), relative to those fed 70\% of their requirements during the first and second trimesters. The CBW was reduced by 0.45 kg (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=96.9\%) when cows were fed 130\% of their CP requirements relative to other dietary CP levels. When cows were fed 140\% of their TDN requirements, CBW decreased by 2.71 kg (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=98.3\%) relative to other TDN levels. Dietary energy or CP levels fed above the requirements to pregnant cows restrict foetal development and CBW.},

	abstract = {A systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis (MA) were performed to evaluate the effects of different energy levels (metabolizable energy, ME) and crude protein (CP), supplied to pregnant cows, on weight of their progenies at 60 (BW60), 100 (BW100), 180 (BW180) and 205 (BW205) days of age, average daily gain (ADG), and weight, age, loin eye area (LEA), marbling and fat thickness (FT) at slaughter. The SR was performed on two electronic databases. The MA for random effects was performed for each response variable separately. The BW60 was reduced (P{\textless}0.001; I2 = 78.9\%) when cows consumed CP and ME above the required levels during the third trimester of pregnancy (3TRI). The BW205 was lower (P{\textless}0.001; I2 = 92.6\%) when cows consumed ME above the recommended levels in the second trimester of pregnancy (2TRI) and 3TRI. Conversely, the ADG was higher when cows consumed CP (P = 0.032; I2 = 96.1\%) and ME (P{\textless}0.001; I2 = 96.1\%) above the required levels. The steers whose mothers consumed CP and ME above the required levels during the 3TRI were slaughtered 5.5 days earlier (P = 0.015; I2 = 98.5\%) compared to other steers. The marbling was higher (P{\textless}0.001; I2 = 91.7\%) in calves born to mothers consuming CP and ME above the recommended levels, regardless of the gestation phase. The FT was higher (P{\textless}0.001; I2 = 0\%) in the offspring of cows that consumed CP and ME above the required levels during the 3TRI. Thus, CP and ME intake, at levels higher than those recommended by the NRC, by pregnant cows in the 3TRI reduces the progeny weight up to 205 days of age. However, this is advantageous during the finishing phase, as it reduces slaughter age and increases the ADG and carcass quality by improving marbling and FT.},

	abstract = {Wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons of the spinal dorsal horn respond to a wide range of innocuous and noxious mechanical stimulation and encode the intensity of mechanical stimuli as changes in firing rate. However, there are inconsistent findings regarding whether WDR neuron stimulus encoding activity is altered in pathological pain states. This inconsistency may arise from differences in the pain models used or in the experimental conditions themselves. In this study, we use a meta-regression approach to examine which variables modulate and determine WDR activity. We pooled data from in vivo electrophysiological studies of WDR activity evoked by von Frey filament stimulation of the hind paw in rats across a number of pathological pain models. We observed that WDR firing rate was better predicted by the calculated pressure of von Frey stimulation rather than applied filament force, as reported in all studies. The pressure-evoked firing rate of WDR neurons was not altered by any experimental pain model except for arthritis and inflammation models, where mechanical stimuli evoked a higher firing rate than controls. Conversely, there was a consistent increase in the spontaneous firing rate of WDR neurons in neuropathic pain, arthritis and inflammation, and chemoneuropathy pain models. Overall, these data indicate that changes in WDR encoding of applied pressure are unlikely to significantly contribute to pathological sensory processing but suggest a possible role for these neurons in spontaneous pain.},

	abstract = {Although exposure to high levels of microbial bioaerosols can be linked to the deterioration of the human respiratory system, precise exposure levels responsible for such effects are still unknown. A previous systematic review concluded that there was not enough information in the studies in humans to derive an exposure-response relationship. Thus, the aim of this systematic review was to derive exposure limits for microbial bioaerosols based on health effects in experimental animal studies. A systematic search was done in MEDLINE (PubMed) for long-term in vivo exposure of the respiratory system via inhalation of a quantified microbial bioaerosol. A total of n = 301 studies were retrieved. Abstract screening using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria was followed by full-text screening and standardized data extraction of study characteristics and measured outcomes. As a result, four suitable studies were identified where mice or guinea pigs were exposed for 4-12 weeks to a previously described mixture of fungal spores or conidia via inhalation. The number of macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes following subchronic exposure has been reported by all included papers and suggested a dose- and time-dependent relationship. Significant inflammation was observed following subacute exposure to Aspergillus fumigatus. However, the outcomes of the studies could not be directly compared due to the large degree of variation and poor description of the exposure conditions. It is our conclusion that more experimental research needs to be done with the specific aim of establishing a No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL) and a Lowest-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (LOAEL) for exposure to microbial bioaerosols in ambient air. Expertise of both exposure and outcome assessment should be brought together to enable standardization of experimental animal studies with properly generated aerosols aiming to derive health-based exposure limits.},

METHODS: Five electronic databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched for studies about CPS among older people. All types of publications were included, with the exception of systematic reviews, meta-analyses, opinion letters, editorials, case reports, conference abstracts and comments. An additional search in Google Scholar and a manual review of the reference lists were performed. RESULTS: Overall, 103 studies were included. Several studies explored the role of CPS in the preservation or improvement of muscle mass among healthy subjects (40 studies) and pre-frail, frail or sarcopenic patients (14), with evidence of beneficial effects. Other studies assessed the effect of CPS on bones (12), cardiovascular disease (8), inflamm-aging (7), chronic pulmonary disease (4), neurocognitive function (4), and vaccines (2), with weak evidence of positive effects. Seven studies in the field of protein metabolism investigated the role of CPS as an important contributor to nutritional needs. Other investigational areas are considered in the last five studies. CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effects of CPS in achieving aged-related nutritional goals, in preserving muscle mass and in recovering after hospitalization may be particularly relevant in the elderly.},

	abstract = {Schistosomiasis control is heavily reliant on the drug praziquantel (PZQ), which is used as preventive chemotherapy as part of national helminth control strategies. Given the heavy reliance on PZQ for mass drug administration, there has been considerable research on the potential of parasites developing resistance to the drug, resulting in decreased drug efficacy. However, there have been comparatively fewer studies of other factors that can potentially alter PZQ efficacy. Here, we investigate whether host PZQ metabolism contributes towards variable cure rates. We evaluate factors that can influence the metabolism of PZQ and the resultant effect on the efficacy of PZQ treatment to determine factors that potentially influence an individual's response to the drug. The literature search was directed at published studies from three online databases: Web of Science, PubMed, and EMBASE. The search terms for the review comprised of ([praziquantel OR PZQ] AND [schistosom* OR bilharzia] AND [pharmaco*]) and included studies evaluating PZQ metabolism. Publications were categorised into pharmacokinetics, drug-drug interactions, pharmacogenetics, and metabolite analysis. Forty publications describing human and experimental studies fitted the inclusion criteria and were subjected to data extraction and analysis. The analyses showed that variable exposure to PZQ was associated with alterations in the liver's capacity to metabolise PZQ and observed drug-drug interactions. Other factors influencing the efficacy of PZQ were brand, formulation, and co-administered food. Although some work has been performed on metabolite identification, there was minimal information on PZQ's metabolic pathway, and no pharmacogenetics studies were identified. The study indicated that in both human and experimental studies alterations in the liver's capacity to metabolise PZQ as well as drug-drug interactions affected systemic levels of PZQ that could result in variable cure rates. The study confirmed previous findings of higher antischistosomal activity of (R)-PZQ enantiomer when administered alone compared to the racemate at the same dose as well as improved efficacy when the drug is administered with food. The study also highlighted the need for more comprehensive studies of the PZQ metabolic pathway and PZQ pharmacogenetic studies in humans.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii infecting virtually all warm-blooded animals, including humans, is an intracellular protozoan parasite. The immunocompromised patients or pregnant women infected by Toxoplasma usually can cause encephalitis or abortion. Deer are also the important intermediate host of the parasite and people can be infected by ingesting the undercooked venison. Therefore, to raise the attention of the researchers and T. gondii infection on people in deer, we conducted the meta-analysis. All potential publications on the T. gondii infection in deer were retrieved by searching the PubMed, ScienceDirect, Springer- Link, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang, and VIP Chinese Journal Databases. Finally, a total of 48 publications were included. The pooled seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in deer was 22.92\% (95\% CI 17.89-28.38) calculated by the random effect model. The seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in deer was the lowest in Asia (12.72\%, 95\% CI 6.29-20.89), and the highest in North America (32.21\%, 95\% CI 20.32-45.39). The highest point estimate of deer T. gondii in detection method subgroup was using MAT (31.28\%, 95\% CI 20.15-43.61). The estimated pooled seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in elk (63.50\%, 95\% CI 50.01-76.01) was higher than other types of deer. Our meta-regression analysis found that the subgroups including region, sampling year, age, climate, and deer species may be the main heterogeneous source in our meta-analysis. It is necessary to monitor the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in deer at all times. Furthermore, people should be taken to precautions when ingesting the venison by cooking it well before serving to prevent the T. gondii infection via eating venison.},

The Animal Research Reporting in In Vivo Experiments guidelines were used to evaluate the quality of selected studies. Following screening, 12 studies were eligible for the review. Studies with average quality coefficients predominated (66.67\%), followed by poor (25\%) and excellent (8.33\%) quality coefficients. Minimum quality scores were assigned to the Animal Research Reporting in In Vivo Experiments guideline items: housing and husbandry (9), allocation (11), outcomes (12), interpretation (18) and generalizability (19). Sprague-Dawley rats were the most frequently used (50\%) species, and most studies had a sample size of more than 30 (58.33\%). A defect dimension of 5 mm was the most common (33.33\%). The biological hydroxyapatite composite scaffold was common (50\%), and the bioactive factors were bone morphogenetic protein-2 (50\%) and recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (50\%). Histomorphometric results showed that bone morphogenetic protein-2 enhanced the capacity to regenerate bone considerably. In addition, scaffolds with bone morphogenetic protein-2 resulted in a significant increase in the blood vessel in the new bone. The findings suggested that data on animal experiments of hydroxyapatite scaffold coated with bone morphogenetic protein-2 in murine calvarial defect models lack homogeneity. Animal experiment should follow the Animal Research Reporting in In Vivo Experiments guidelines to promote the high quality, integrity and reproducibility. This systematic review suggested that bone morphogenetic protein-2 enhanced the capacity to regenerate bone and the angiogenesis in the new bone.},

Meta-analysis of pre-clinical data revealed an overall positive effect on neurobehavioral outcome with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of -0.81 (95\% CI: -1.47, -0.15; p = 0.016) with significant heterogeneity (Q = 41.49, I(2) = 68.7\%; p = 0.000). Further subgroup analysis were performed from methodological differences, especially dose and timing of treatments. Furthermore, melatonin reduced cerebral edema by an SMD of -0.78 (95\% CI: -1.23, -0.34; p = 0.001) with low heterogeneity. In conclusion, melatonin treatment significantly improves both behavioral and pathological outcomes in animal models of ICH. In addition, the results should be interpreted in light of the limitations in experimental design and methodological quality of the studies included in the meta-analysis.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) transplantation is a promising treatment strategy for pulmonary fibrosis. Although encouraging results have been obtained using animal models of bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis, it is evident that transplantation of BMSCs at various time-points after BLM administration has produced different results in terms of treatment efficacy. To shed light on the potential utility of BMSCs for the treatment of lung disease, the present study performed a meta-analysis to estimate the efficacy of BMSCs in animal models of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and compare early transplantation (BMSCs injected on the same day after administration of BLM) with late transplantation (BMSCs injected on the 14th day after administration of BLM). Relevant studies were retrieved from the MEDLINE, PubMed, Chinese Knowledge Infrastructure and WanFang databases using a comprehensive search approach. A total of 6 studies involving 228 model rats were included. Meta-analysis indicated that early BMSC transplantation was able to prevent or reduce BLM-induced alveolitis and pulmonary fibrosis, while late BMSC transplantation was able to reduce alveolitis, but there was no significant evidence regarding improvement of pulmonary fibrosis. Although BMSC therapy was identified to be generally beneficial in rodent models of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, the efficacy of early transplantation appears to be more satisfactory; overall, the efficacy of transplantation of BMSCs at the acute inflammatory phase was more effective compared with that at the chronic fibrosis stage. Of note, regarding alveolitis and pulmonary fibrosis scores after late transplantation of BMSCs, the sensitivity analysis revealed that the scores were less stable; thus, this result must be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, the quality and methodology of the included studies was comparatively low. Therefore, higher-quality and more rigorous studies are required to validate the results of the present meta-analysis in the future.},

With an evidence-based approach, this study investigated and analyzed the performance and degradation properties of biodegradable metals in animal models for bone defect repair to explore their potential clinical translation. Animal studies on bone defect repair with biodegradable metals in comparison with other traditional biomaterials were reviewed. Data was carefully collected after identification of population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design (PICOS), and following the inclusion criteria of biodegradable metals in animal studies. 30 publications on pure Mg, Mg alloys, pure Zn and Zn alloys were finally included after extraction from a collected database of 2543 publications. A qualitative systematic review and a quantitative meta-analysis were performed. Given the heterogeneity in animal model, anatomical site and critical size defect (CSD), biodegradable metals exhibited mixed effects on bone defect repair and degradation in animal studies in comparison with traditional non-degradable metals, biodegradable polymers, bioceramics, and autogenous bone grafts. The results indicated that there were limitations in the experimental design of the included studies, and quality of the evidence presented by the studies was very low. To enhance clinical translation of biodegradable metals, evidence-based research with data validity is needed. Future studies should adopt standardized experimental protocols in investigating the effects of biodegradable metals on bone defect repair with animal models.},

Searches were performed on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang and CNKI databases for animal experiments comparing loading protocols and the long-term stability of micro-screws. Among 1011 detected papers, 16 studies met the eligibility criteria and were selected for analysis. Most studies showed medium methodological quality for evaluation of micro-screws' long-term stability. Five studies reported that loading would not destroy the long-term stability of micro-screws. Three studies indicated that low-intensity immediate loading or a 3-week minimal healing time was acceptable. Two studies reported that the loading magnitude was a controversial issue with regard to the micro-screws' long-term stability. Two studies suggested that counterclockwise loading could decrease the long-term stability of micro-screws. In conclusion, immediate loading below 100g force, healing time greater than 3 weeks, regular loading below 200g force and a clockwise direction of force supported the long-term stability of micro-screws. Further studies relating to the combination of varying loading conditions will be needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the years, mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) have been pre-clinically applied in the treatment of variety kinds of diseases including asthma and chronic lung diseases. Aim of the current study was to systematically review and to conduct meta-analysis on the published studies of MSC treatment in asthma animal models. METHODS: Publications on the MSC and asthma treatment was thoroughly searched in the electronic databases. Statistical analysis was then performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (Version 3). Effect of MSC therapy on asthma model was assessed by Hedges's g with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs). Random effect model was used due to the heterogeneity between the studies. RESULTS: Meta-analysis of the 32 included studies showed that MSC transplantation was significantly in favor of attenuating lung injury and remodeling (Hedges's g = -9.104 ± 0.951 with 95\% CI: -10.969 ∼ -7.240, P {\textless} 0.001) and airway inflammation (Hedges's g = -4.146 ± 0.688 with 95\% CI: -5.495 ∼ -2.797, P {\textless} 0.001). The mechanism of MSC therapy in asthma seems to be regulating the balance of Th1 cytokine and Th2 cytokines (IFN-γ: Hedges's g = 4.779 ± 1.408 with 95\% CI: 1.099-2.725, P {\textless} 0.001; IL-4: Hedges's g = -10.781 ± 1.062 with 95\% CI: -12.863 ∼ -8.699, P {\textless} 0.001; IL-5: Hedges's g = -10.537 ± 1.269 with 95\% CI: -13.025 ∼ -8.050, P {\textless} 0.001; IL-13: Hedges's g = -6.773 ± 0.788 with 95\% CI: -8.318 ∼ -5.229, P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: Findings of the current systemic review suggested a potential role for MSCs in asthma treatment although it is still challenging in clinical practice. The mechanisms of MSCs in pre-clinical asthma treatment may be associated with attenuating airway inflammation through regulating Th1 and Th2 cytokines.},

	abstract = {Brucellosis is one of the most common zoonoses worldwide, causing huge economic losses in the animal industry and posing a serious threat to human health. Although the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) has recommended strategies or measures to control or eradicate brucellosis, only some developed countries have achieved freedom from animal brucellosis. In developing countries, brucellosis remains a serious problem, and the importance of its control has attracted little attention. The strategies and measures are difficult to implement effectively in countries with limited resources because the eradication of brucellosis is an expensive, time-consuming and labor-intensive project. Therefore, more effort is needed to explore the appropriate strategies and measures in developing countries. In this study, we collected the available publications regarding brucellosis control or eradication programs in different countries and areas, and summarized the main strategies and measures, supplementary measures, effects, and lessons learned during their implementation. Results showed that the freedom from animal brucellosis was only achieved in three countries among the 23 included countries and areas after the implementation of the programs, which had lasted several decades. Either alone or together, vaccination and test-and-slaughter programs can effectively reduce brucellosis prevalence. Supplementary measures involve a number of aspects, and their effective implementation is crucial to the success of disease control and cannot be ignored. While disease control or eradication requires extensive resources, some studies have shown that a well-designed and well-implemented disease control or eradication program is economically effective. Experience has revealed that even if significant results have been achieved, the project could not be terminated without careful consideration due to the potential for recurrence.},

Awareness and knowledge of brucellosis among occupational workers is considered an important aspect of brucellosis control in both humans and animals. The aim of this study was to explore the distributions of the pooled awareness level and the knowledge level of the disease worldwide. METHODS: A meta-analysis was carried out to obtain pooled brucellosis awareness levels and knowledge levels of respondents regarding the zoonotic nature of brucellosis, mode of brucellosis transmission, and brucellosis symptoms in animals and humans. The analysis was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses guidelines. RESULTS: A total of seventy-nine original articles reporting the brucellosis awareness levels of in populations from 22 countries were assessed. The total pooled awareness level of brucellosis was 55.5\%, and the pooled awareness levels regarding the zoonotic nature of brucellosis, mode of brucellosis transmission, signs of human brucellosis and signs of animal brucellosis were 37.6\%, 35.9\%, 41.6\%, and 28.4\% respectively. The pooled awareness level was higher than the brucellosis-related knowledge level. Subgroup analyses showed that no obvious differences in brucellosis awareness levels between high-risk populations in Asia and Africa. Health workers (including human health workers and veterinarians) had the greatest overall awareness and knowledge of human brucellosis. The overall awareness levels and knowledge levels of livestock owners (farmers) and herders were higher than those of dairy farmers and abattoir workers. In addition, awareness and knowledge levels were higher among people who were involved in bovine, caprine and ovine animal production or in caprine and ovine animal production than among people who were involved in only bovine animal production. CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient awareness and knowledge of brucellosis were observed in the original studies conducted mainly in Asia and Africa. Interventions to improve public knowledge about brucellosis are urgently needed.},

Data were extracted from articles collected from PubMed, Web of Science, and other databases. The pooled standard mean deviation (SMD) with 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) was used to evaluate the association between the male rodent reproductive system impairment and PBDE exposure. Ten articles were included in the present meta-analysis and systematic review. The summary SMD of reproductive toxicity associated with PBDEs was -0.46 (95\% CI: -0.69, -0.22), and the overall association between DE-71 along with BDE-209 and male reproductive system damage was statistically significant (SMD = -0.7 95\% CI: -1.18, -0.21, p = .041; SMD = -0.41, 95\% CI: -0.77, -0.05, p = .000). The adverse impact of PBDEs on rodent male reproductive system, especially seminal vesicle (SMD = -1.09, 95\% CI: -1.49, -0.49, p = .523) and ventral prostate (SMD = -1.27, 95\% CI: -1.88, -0.65, p = .821), were clearly demonstrated. Moderate (SMD = -0.81, 95\% CI: -1.182, -0.437, p = .197) and high (SMD = -0.41, 95\% CI: -0.76, -0.05, p = .000) dosage may have exerted effect than relatively low (SMD = -0.29, 95\% CI: -0.17, 0.12, p = .136) dosage. In conclusion, our meta-analysis and systematic review suggested PBDE toxicity on the male reproductive system.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii, is one of the most important foodborne zoonotic pathogens, which can infect virtually all warm-blooded animals, including pigs, and causes severe illness in congenitally infected infants and even death in patients with AIDS. Pigs (Sus scrofa) are one of the most important intermediate hosts of T. gondii, and human transmission occurs through consumption of raw or poorly cooked pork. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Chongqing VIP, Wanfang, Chinese Web of Knowledge, PubMed, and ScienceDirect databases for published papers regarding Toxoplasma infection in pigs in China, from inception to Oct 29, 2017. Search strings included whether they reported the samples of more than 30 pigs and provided information that allowed us to establish the prevalence of Toxoplasma infection. Moreover, we excluded repeated studies, reviews, other host studies, as well as studies with inconsistent data, incomplete information, those that only provided prevalence data, and those outside of Mainland China. We extracted the numbers of pigs with Toxoplasma infection from the obtained studies, and calculated the pooled prevalence of Toxoplasma infection in the pigs using a random-effects model. The data of 44 articles (including data on 46,723 pigs) were compliant with the standards. The pooled prevalence of T. gondii infection in pigs in China was 29\% (95\% CI 24-34), with 25\% (95\% CI 18-32) in pigs sampled before 2010 and 28\% (95\% CI 21-36) in pigs sampled in 2010 or later. The pooled prevalence of T. gondii in pigs from Northeast China (20\%, 95\% CI 14-26) was significantly lower than those from other regions (North China: 40\%, 95\% CI 32-47; Northwest China: 32\%, 95\% CI 13-51; East China: 30\%, 95\% CI 20-41; and South China: 35\%, 95\% CI 26-45; Central China: 23\%, 95\% CI 14-31; Southwest China: 33\%, 95\% CI 15-52). The estimated pooled prevalence of T. gondii infection was 36\% (95\% CI 25-47, 8,018/21,892) in pigs tested by ELISA, 24\% (95\% CI 19-28, 4,304/18,608) in pigs examined by IHA, and 19\% (95\% CI 8-31, 1,041/6,223) in pigs detected by other methods. Moreover, 1202 of 7470 piglets were detected as T. gondii-positive, and the prevalence (17\%) was lower than that in fattening pigs (25\%, OR = 1.28), sows (34\%, OR = 2.13), and breeding boars (35\%, OR = 2.46). Our findings suggested that toxoplasmosis is common in pigs in Mainland China. It is necessary to monitor the prevalence of T. gondii in pigs, and powerful and effective regulatory measures should be undertaken to reduce human exposure to T. gondii via the consumption of pork.},

	volume = {7},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several clinical studies have evaluated the use of tralokinumab (CAT-354) administration in patients with moderate to severe asthma; no consensus on tralokinumab efficacy and safety was reached. Thus, further analysis is required on the efficacy and safety of tralokinumab as an asthma biologic. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous injection of tralokinumab in patients with moderate to severe asthma. METHODS: Clinical trials were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov from their inception to November 4, 2018. Only randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with tralokinumab versus placebo treatment in patients with moderate to severe asthma were evaluated. Efficacy and safety outcomes were extracted, and a meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. The Cochrane Collaboration's risk-of-bias assessment tool was used to assess the risk of bias. RESULTS: Five studies describing 6 RCTs (including 2928 adults with moderate to severe asthma) were pooled and analyzed in this study. Absolute FEV(1) was statistically improved in patients receiving tralokinumab at 300 mg every 2 weeks (mean difference [MD], 0.14 L; 95\% CI, 0.08-0.21) and 600 mg every 2 weeks (MD, 0.20 L; 95\% CI, 0.01-0.39), as well as FEV(1)\% changes (MD, 5.82\%, 95\% CI, 3.58-8.06, and MD, 11.8\%, 95\% CI, 0.79-22.81, respectively). Also, absolute forced vital capacity volume changes (MD, 0.11 L; 95\% CI, 0.01-0.21) and percentage changes (MD, 4.44\%; 95\% CI, 0.84-8.04) improved in tralokinumab at 300 mg every 2 weeks. Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire scores were not significantly different, and absolute Asthma Control Questionnaire 6 scores were statistically improved but did not reach the clinically meaningful difference. Tralokinumab treatment did not decrease annualized asthma exacerbation rate in unselected patients with moderate to severe asthma, but it was associated with improved annualized asthma exacerbation rate in patients with severe asthma with high fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels (rate ratio, 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.53-0.97). Tralokinumab was not associated with an increased incidence of serious adverse events, but it did show an increase in mild injection-site reactions (odds ratio, 5.92; 95\% CI, 1.61-21.76). CONCLUSION: This pooled analysis of 6 RCTs suggested that tralokinumab was well tolerated and it modestly improved FEV(1) and forced vital capacity in patients with moderate to severe asthma. It did not render clinically important improvements in asthma-related quality of life, and nor did it reduce asthma exacerbations.},

	abstract = {Objective: This study aims to investigate the effect of fish and omega-3 fatty acids consumption on the risk of VTE. Methods: A comprehensive literature search in the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase (up to September 2020), was conducted to identify the prospective cohort studies concerning the associations of fish and omega-3 fatty acids consumption with the risk of VTE. The pooled relative risk (RR) of VTE for the highest vs. lowest category of fish and omega-3 fatty acids consumption, as well as their corresponding 95\% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Results: A total of seven articles with eight prospective cohort studies were included. Specifically, six studies were related to fish consumption, and the overall multi-variable adjusted RR showed no significant relationship between fish consumption and the risk of VTE (RR = 1.02, 95\% CI: 0.93-1.11; P = 0.709). In the four studies related to omega-3 fatty acids consumption, the overall multi-variable adjusted RR suggested that omega-3 fatty acids consumption was associated with a lower risk of VTE (RR = 0.89, 95\% CI: 0.80-0.98; P = 0.024). Moreover, two studies were related to recurrent VTE, and the overall multi-variable adjusted RR demonstrated a significant inverse association between omega-3 fatty acids consumption and the risk of recurrent VTE (RR = 0.45, 95\% CI: 0.25-0.81; P = 0.008). Conclusion: Although current evidence is still insufficient to demonstrate any relationship between fish consumption and the risk of VTE, omega-3 fatty acids consumption seems to be associated with a lower risk of both VTE and recurrent VTE. Further large well-designed prospective cohort studies are warranted to elaborate the issues examined in this study.},

Infections from human and animal reservoir hosts occur due to the consumption of raw or undercooked fish with C. sinensis metacercariae. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of C. sinensis metacercariae in fish in South-East Asia via systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang and Chongqing VIP databases for studies published between 1976 and 2020 that are related to the prevalence of C. sinensis metacercariae in fish. Studies were screened with keywords based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Seventy-one eligible articles were identified, covering three countries: China, Korea and Vietnam. The pooled prevalence of C. sinensis metacercariae in fish from South-East Asia was 30.5\%, with 35.1\% in China, 29.7\% in Korea and 8.4\% in Vietnam. In subgroup analyses of climate, season, water source and publication date, the highest prevalence was identified in the Dwb climate type (43.3\%), summer (70.2\%), river (34.5\%) and pre-2001 publications (38.9\%), respectively. In comparison, the lowest prevalence was found in the Dfa climate type (14.5\%), winter (19.5\%), lake (8.0\%) and post-2001 publications (23.8\%). Meta-regression results indicated that country (p = .009), the published time (p = .035) and water source subgroups (p = .003) may be the source of heterogeneity. Overall, our study indicates that a high prevalence of C. sinensis infections occurs in fish in China, Korea and Vietnam, illuminating a significant public health concern in these countries.},

Various nanoscale delivery systems have been developed for improving its bioavailability. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of nanoscale delivery systems on improving lutein bioavailability in rodent models. Using EBSCOhost and PubMed, a total of eleven peer-reviewed articles published from 2000 to 2020 were identified. Plasma lutein concentration, pharmacokinetic parameters, including maximum concentration (C(max)), area under curve (AUC), and time to reach the maximum concentration (T(max)), and lutein accumulation in organs were extracted to evaluate the bioavailability of lutein using nanoscale delivery methods as compared with unencapsulated or raw lutein. Various nanoscale delivery systems, including polymer nanoparticles, emulsions, and lutein nanoparticles, significantly improved the bioavailability of lutein, as evidenced by increased plasma lutein concentrations, C(max), or AUC. Additionally, five out of seven studies observed enhanced accumulation of lutein in the liver and the eyes. Polymer nanoparticles and emulsions improve the dispersibility and stability of lutein, thus lutein might be more accessible in the small intestine. Lutein nanoparticles shortened the T(max). Further studies are warranted to evaluate the effectiveness of nanoscale delivery systems on improving the functionalities of lutein.},

Even though commercial antimicrobial interventions in meat industries are overall efficient to eliminate bacterial contamination, the capability of antibiotic resistant bacteria of resisting to antimicrobial interventions, compared to the susceptible bacterial population, was not fully understood. The aim of this study was to compare the impacts of various antimicrobial interventions used for beef processing on antibiotic resistant and susceptible strains of Salmonella and Escherichia coli. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify, evaluate and summarize primary research that provide quantitative information about the efficacy of various antimicrobial interventions in reducing antibiotic resistant and susceptible bacterial contamination of raw beef products. Eleven citations (of 409) were determined to be relevant to address the question (nine citations for Salmonella and two for Escherichia coli) and eligible for data extraction and subsequent meta-analysis. Through the comprehensive search, data for five categories of antimicrobial interventions, including acid, oxidizer, physical, thermal treatments, and others, were summarized. Ratio of the efficacy of eliminating antibiotic resistant to susceptible contamination by a specific intervention was calculated, showing most of efficacy ratios were around 1.0. The results indicate that the efficacy of antimicrobial interventions commonly used during beef processing in reducing bacteria is not affected by their antibiotic resistant profiles.},

Summarized results of relative risk (RR) with corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random effects model. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias were also performed. The final analysis in this report included a total of 9 articles. The summarized RR and 95\%CI from 8 studies for dietary fresh fish intake and glioma risk was 0.823 (95\%CI= 0.698-0.970), with no evidence of significant between-study heterogeneity (I2=43.6\%, P=0.088). Moreover, positive associations were also found both in Caucasian populations and Asia populations. Seven studies were used to assess the relationship between dietary processed fish intake and the risk of glioma. Significantly increased risk of glioma was found for the highest category of dietary processed fish intake [summarized RR= 1.554, 95\%CI= 1.169-2.066, I2= 72.1\%, P= 0.001], especially among Caucasian populations. No publication bias was found. In summary, findings from this meta-analysis concluded that dietary fresh fish intake could reduce the risk of glioma. However, very high processed fish intake had a significant association with increased glioma risk.},

The software Stata12.0 was used for the meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was examined using I(2) statistics, and we conducted subgroup analyses to determine the causes of heterogeneity for escape latency and duration in original platform. RESULTS: Sixteen studies involving 363 animals met the inclusion criteria. The included studies scored between 4 and 8 points, and the mean was 5.44. The results of the meta-analysis indicated remarkable differences with acupuncture on increasing the duration in the former platform quadrant both in EO models (SMD = 1.56, 95\% CI: 1.02 {\textasciitilde} 2.11; p {\textless} 0.00001) and 2-VO models (SMD 4.29, 95\% CI 3.23 {\textasciitilde} 5.35; p {\textless} 0.00001) compared with the control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture may be effective in improving cognitive function in vascular dementia animal models. The mechanisms of acupuncture for vascular dementia are multiple such as anti-apoptosis, antioxidative stress reaction, and metabolism enhancing of glucose and oxygen.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used subject and free words to search PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. The risk-of-bias evaluation tool was used to assess literature quality. Data merging and statistical analyses were carried out using Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 13.0. All indicators were expressed as the mean difference (MD) and 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI). The heterogeneity test was conducted according to I(2) and Q tests. We used Egger's test to evaluate publication bias quantitatively. RESULTS: This was a meta-analysis of intervention trials. Thirty-two studies (1562 patients) were included. The quality of the included studies was acceptable. Compared with consumption of animal protein, plant protein reduced total cholesterol (TC) (MD = - 0.19 mmol/L, 95\% CI - 0.26, - 0.12), triglyceride (MD = - 0.07 mmol/L, 95\% CI - 0.13, - 0.02), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (MD = - 0.19 mmol/L, 95\% CI - 0.26, - 0.13), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD = - 0.05 mmol/L, 95\% CI - 0.09, - 0.01), TC/LDL-C ratio (MD = - 0.17, 95\% CI - 0.32, - 0.02) and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio (MD = - 0.20, 95\% CI - 0.33, - 0.06) significantly and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (MD = 0.03 mmol/L, 95\% CI 0.01, 0.06) levels, but had no effect on BW (MD = - 0.41 kg, 95\% CI - 2.14, 1.33) or BMI (MD = 0.11 kg/m(2), 95\% CI - 0.51, 0.73).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inconsistent results of the association between fish consumption and stroke risk have been indicated in previous epidemiological studies. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to estimate the impact of fish consumption on stroke risk. METHODS: The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched through a computer search. Prospective cohort studies satisfying predetermined inclusion criterion were included. Random-effect model was adopted in this meta-analysis. Analysis of subgroup, sensitivity, publication bias, dose-response, power, and quality of evidence was also conducted. RESULTS: Thirty one publications including 33 independent prospective cohort studies were identified in this meta-analysis. In the primary analysis of the highest versus lowest categories of fish consumption, pooled results indicated that a significant trend toward an inverse association between fish intake and stroke risk (HR = .90, 95\% confidence interval [CI] .85-.96). Further subgroup analyses indicated an inverse association was more pronounced in the group of hemorrhagic stroke (HR=.88, 95\% CI .80-.96), female (HR =.83, 95\% CI .75-.92), and Asia-Pacific (HR = .87, 95\% CI .80-.95). Both the funnel plot and Egger tests suggested no evidence of publication bias. Dose-response analysis showed a linear relationship between fish intake and stroke and the risk of stroke decreased by 2\%-12\% with increasing intake of fish up to 100-700 g/week. According to the NutriGrade scoring system, the level of metaevidence quality was moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Based on current evidence from prospective cohort studies, we concluded that fish consumption was associated with a decreased risk of stroke.},

A meta-analysis of survival rates revealed a significant advantage of RAGE inhibition in comparison with controls (HR 0.67, 95\% CI 0.52-0.86). This effect was most pronounced in polymicrobial infection (HR 0.28, 95\% CI 0.14-0.55), followed by Gram positive (G(+)) bacterial infection (HR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.50-0.97) and Gram negative (G(-)) bacterial infection (HR 0.89, 95\% CI 0.58-1.38). For G(+) bacterial infection, RAGE inhibition decreased bacterial outgrowth and dissemination, inflammatory cell influx, plasma cytokine levels, and pulmonary injury. Conclusions RAGE inhibition appears to have a beneficial impact on the outcome of sepsis in animal models, although there are discrepancies between different types of infection.},

	abstract = {Interleukin (IL)-33 is a member of the IL-1 family of proteins that have multiple roles in organ-specific inflammation. Many studies suggest diagnostic and therapeutic implications of this cytokine. Many studies have reported pro-inflammatory roles for IL-33 in innate immune responses involving the heart and lung. Recent studies also describe pro-inflammatory and regulatory roles for IL-33 in the pathogenesis of brain and liver disorders in addition to regulatory roles for this cytokine in the heart and lung. In this focused systematic review, we will review the literature regarding pro-inflammatory and regulatory effects of IL-33 in the brain and liver. We will also assess the potential risk of bias in the published literature in order to uncover gaps in the knowledge that will be useful for the scientific community. We utilized guidelines set by preferred reporting items for systemic reviews and meta-analyses. The electronic database was PubMed. Eligibility criteria included organ-specific inflammation in mice and humans, organ-specific inflammation in the central nervous and hepatic systems, and IL-33. Outcomes were pro-inflammatory or regulatory effects of IL-33. Risk of bias in individual studies and across studies was addressed by adapting the Cochrane Rob 2.0 tool. We discovered that a source of bias across the studies was a lack of randomization in human studies. Additionally, because the majority of studies were performed in mice, this could be perceived as a potential risk of bias. Regarding the central nervous system, roles for IL-33 in the development and maturation of neuronal circuits were reported; however, exact mechanisms by which this occurred were not elucidated. IL-33 was produced by astrocytes and endothelial cells while IL-33 receptors were expressed by microglia and astrocytes, demonstrating that these cells are first responders for IL-33; however, in the CNS, IL-33 seems to induce Th1 cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α chemokines such as RANTES, MCP-1, MIP-1α, and IP-10, as well as nitric oxide. In the liver, similar risks of bias were determined because of the lack of randomized controlled trials in humans and because the majority of studies were performed in mice. Interestingly, the strain of mouse utilized in the study seemed to affect the role of IL-33 in liver inflammation. Lastly, similar to the brain, IL-33 appeared to have ST2-independent regulatory functions in the liver. Our results reveal plausible gaps in what is known regarding IL-33 in the pathogenesis of brain and liver disorders. We highlight key studies in the lung and heart as examples of advancements that likely occurred because of countless basic and translational studies in this area. More research is needed in these areas in order to assess the diagnostic or therapeutic potential of IL-33 in these disorders.},

This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effects of the addition of suction to simple water-seal on the postoperative outcomes. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched from their inception to 30 August 2017. The risk ratio and the weight mean difference were calculated for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively, each with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). The heterogeneity and risk of bias were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 10 randomized controlled trials enrolling 1601 patients were included. Overall, compared with simple water-seal, the addition of external suction reduced the occurrence of postoperative pneumothorax (risk ratio 0.35, 95\% CI 0.13-0.93; P = 0.04) and other cardiopulmonary complications (risk ratio 0.65, 95\% CI 0.48-0.89; P = 0.008), and increased the duration of chest tube drainage (weight mean difference 0.92 days, 95\% CI 0.04-1.81, P = 0.04). However, the effect difference between the 2 groups was not significant regarding air leak duration, length of hospital stay and the occurrence of prolonged air leak. The stability of these studies was strong. No evidence of publication bias was detected. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of suction to simple water-seal made no difference to air leak duration, hospital stay or the occurrence of prolonged air leak following pulmonary surgery.

The present systematic review sought to further clarify the efficacy and safety of resveratrol in the treatment of sepsis. Studies on resveratrol application in the treatment of sepsis-induced organ injury in animal models were reviewed by searching various Chinese and other language databases (PubMed, Embase, CNKI, WanFang and WeiPu) and by manually searching the references of related articles. The selection and evaluation of the studies was performed by two independent reviewers. A total of 260 related studies were initially identified. Following application of the exclusion factors and inclusion criteria, 11 studies were included. Meta-analysis revealed that resveratrol exerted significant protective effect in sepsis-induced animal models of organ injury, through anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and pro-microcirculatory functions compared with in the placebo group. While nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF-2) are the two major signaling pathways to have been associated with the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects of resveratrol, these factors were not quantified for mean values, therefore not suitable for systematic evaluation. For related factors, the results of meta-analysis were as follows: For tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), the standardized mean difference (SMD) was -13.50 [95\% confidence interval (CI): -22.08, -4.91; P=0.002]; for malondialdehyde (MDA), the SMD was -3.10 (95\% CI: -5.27, -0.93; P=0.005); for mean arterial pressure the SMD was 1.34 (95\% CI: 0.07, 2.62; P=0.04); for interleukin (IL)-6 the SMD was -9.57 (95\% CI: -20.90, 1.75; P=0.10); and for IL-10 the SMD was 0.80 (95\% CI: -0.73, 2.34; P=0.31). It was concluded that resveratrol exerted significant anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects through NF-κB and NRF-2 signaling pathways in animal models of sepsis-induced multiple organ injury, manifesting as significant downregulation of TNF-α and MDA expression and improved microcirculation, therefore ameliorating septic damage to the body, which may ultimately improve survival ratios.},

	abstract = {Background: Brucellosis is one of the most significant zoonosis over the world, threatening both veterinary and human public health. However, few studies were focused on nationwide animal brucellosis and made association with human brucellosis. Methodology and Principal Findings: We conducted a bilingual literature search on Brucella or brucellosis in China on the two largest databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure and PubMed) and conducted a systematic review. A total of 1,383 Chinese and 81 English publications, published between 1958 and 2018 were identified. From them, 357 publications presenting 692 datasets were subjected to the meta-analysis. The overall prevalence rate is 1.70\% (95\% CI: 1.66-1.74), with a declining (until the late 1990s) and rising trend (starting the early 2000s). Interestingly, the animal with highest prevalence rate is canine (8.35\%, 95\% CI: 7.21-9.50), and lowest in cattle (1.22\%, 95\% CI: 1.17-1.28). The prevalence of Brucella in animals was unequally distributed among the 24 examined regions in China. Conclusions: Brucellosis is a reemerging disease for both humans and animals in China. The observed data suggests that dogs and yaks are the leading reservoirs for Brucella, and the provinces with highest prevalence rates in animals are Hubei, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, Fujian, and Guizhou. Accordingly targeted intervention policy should be implemented to break the Brucella transmission chain between animals and humans in China.},

	abstract = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that has few treatment options. Riluzole, a sodium channel blocker used to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, has been initially trialed in human SCI. We performed a systematic review to critically assess the efficacy of riluzole in locomotor recovery and damage extension in SCI rat models, and the potential for clinical translation. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Chinese databases were searched from their inception date to March 2018. Two reviewers independently selected animal studies that evaluated neurological recovery and lesion area following riluzole treatment in SCI rat models, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Pairwise meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, and network meta-analysis were performed to assess the effects of riluzole on SCI. Ten eligible studies were included. Two studies had high methodological quality. Overall, the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores were increased in riluzole-treated animals versus controls, and effect sizes showed a gradual increase from the 1st (five studies, n = 104, mean difference = 1.24, 95\% CI = 0.11 to 2.37, p = 0.03) to 6th week after treatment (five studies, n = 120, mean difference = 2.34, 95\% CI = 1.26 to 3.42, p {\textless} 0.0001). Riluzole was associated with improved outcomes in the inclined plane test and the tissue preservation area. Subgroup analyses suggested an association of locomotor recovery with riluzole dose. Network meta-analysis showed that 5 mg/kg riluzole exhibited greater protection than 2.5 and 8 mg/kg riluzole. Collectively, this review suggests that riluzole has a protective effect on SCI, with good safety and a clear mechanism of action and may be suitable for future clinical trials or applications. However, animal results should be interpreted with caution given the known limitations in animal experimental design and methodological quality.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lupus nephritis is usually manifested by proteinuria, active urinary sediment, hypertension, and renal failure and is a serious complication with more than 50\% occurrence in systemic lupus erythematosus patients. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) present remarkable immunomodulatory ability, and these cells are potential therapeutic agents for autoimmune disorders. In clinical trials, the effectiveness of MSC in the treatment of lupus nephritis is still controversial. A meta-analysis was performed to assess whether MSC can achieve good efficacy in the treatment of lupus nephritis in mice. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed in Cochrane Library, ISI Web of Science, PubMed, and EMBASE from inception to Oct 1, 2019. Two authors independently extracted the data, which were pooled and calculated using RevMan 5.3. RESULTS: A total of 28 studies met the inclusion criteria. MSC treatment resulted in lower levels of ds-DNA (OR = - 29.58, 95\% CI - 29.58, - 17.99; P {\textless} 0.00001), ANA (OR = - 70.93, 95\% CI - 104.55, - 37.32; P {\textless} 0.0001), Scr (OR = - 8.20, 95\% CI - 12.71, - 3.69; P = 0.0004), BUN (OR = - 14.57, 95\% CI - 20.50, - 8.64; P {\textless} 0.00001), proteinuria (OR = - 4.26, 95\% CI - 5.15 to - 3.37; P {\textless} 0.00001), and renal sclerosis score (OR = - 1.92, 95\% CI - 2.66 to - 1.18; P {\textless} 0.00001), and MSC treatment could get higher levels of albumin. To detect the potential, the cytokines were also assessed, and the MSC treatment group had lower levels of IL-2, IL-12, IL-17, and IFN-γ when compared with the control group. However, the difference was not notable for IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TGF-β, MCP-1, TNF-α, Th1, Th17, Foxp3, or Tregs. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that MSC treatment in an animal model for lupus nephritis in the studies included in the meta-analysis resulted in lower levels of ds-DNA, ANA, Scr, BUN, proteinuria, and renal sclerosis score, and MSC treatment could get higher levels of albumin.},

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review in both English and Chinese search engines. We estimated the pooled odds ratios of biosecurity indicators relating to AI infections at market level using a quality effects (QE) meta-analysis model. RESULTS: Biosecurity measures effective at reducing AI market contamination and poultry infection at LBMs include smaller market size, selling single poultry species and separating different species, performing cleaning and disinfection and market closures, ban on overnight storage, and sourcing poultry from local areas. Our meta-analysis indicates that higher risk of exposure to AI infection occurs in workers at retail LBMs, female workers, and those who contact ducks, conduct cleaning, slaughtering, defeathering, or evisceration. CONCLUSIONS: The most effective strategies to reduce AI market contamination identified in this study should target larger LBMs that are located at noncentral city areas and sell and slaughter multispecies of live poultry.

Previous research has suggested its potentially beneficial effects on diabetic nephropathies. However, its effects and protective mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a preclinical systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and potential mechanisms of ASIV in reducing kidney damage in diabetes mellitus (DM) models. Studies were searched from nine databases until January 2020. A random-effects model was used to calculate combined standardised mean difference estimates and 95 \% confidence intervals. Risk of bias of studies was assessed using the Systematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experimentation risk of bias tool 10-item checklist. RevMan 5.3 software was used for statistical analysis. Twenty-three studies involving 562 animals were included in the meta-analysis. Studies quality scores ranged from 2 to 5. The ASIV group induced a marked decrease in serum creatinine (P {\textless} 0.00001), blood urea nitrogen (P {\textless} 0.00001), 24-h urine protein (P {\textless} 0.00001) and pathological score (P {\textless} 0.001) compared with the control group. The determined potential mechanisms of ASIV action were relieving oxidative stress, delaying renal fibrosis, anti-apoptosis and anti-inflammatory action. We conclude that ASIV exerts renal protective effects in animals with DM through multiple signalling pathways.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: With increasing use of pharmaceuticals, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) has become a significant therapeutic challenge to physicians all over the world. Drugs based on Schisandra fruits (SF for short, the fruits of Schisandra chinensis or Schisandra sphenanthera) or synthetic analogues of schisandrin C, are commonly prescribed for treating DILI in China. PURPOSE: This review summarizes the literature regarding the application of SF-derived drugs in patients with DILI and current understanding of mechanisms underlying the protective effects of SF against liver injury. METHODS: Keywords related to drug-induced liver injury and Schisandra fruits were searched in the following databases: Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, LiverTox, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Scientific Journal database (VIP), and Wanfang database. All studies, published in English or Chinese, were included. Clinical study exclusion criteria: if patients received other Chinese herbal medicines in a study, the study will not be included in this review. RESULTS: Clinical studies have shown that SF-derived drugs are effective in inhibiting drug-induced elevation of serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase and total bilirubin. Cellular and animal studies have demonstrated that crude SF extracts, lignan compounds found in SF, and SF-derived drugs are effective in protecting the liver against xenobiotic-induced injury. Regulation of cytochrome P450 enzyme activity, anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation and acceleration of liver regeneration are involved in the hepatoprotective mechanisms of SF. CONCLUSION: SF-derived drugs are effective in ameliorating DILI in China. To verify the clinical efficacy of these drugs, high-quality clinical studies are needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is an increasing of reports describing the efficacy of neuroprotective small molecule in Parkinson's disease (PD) models. Ideally, the choice of pushing drug candidates to clinical trial should be based on an unbiased assessment of all available data. Systematic review uses a methodical approach to minimize the bias in the selection of studies for inclusion, providing a comprehensive understanding of the drug's effects on multiple animal models with different mechanism. To our knowledge, such assessments of baicalein, which is a candidate neuroprotective drug with efficacy in PD, have not been fully conducted. PURPOSE: To provide a comprehensive understanding of baicalein's effects on different animal models with different mechanism by using a methodical approach to minimize the bias in the selection of studies. METHODS: In this study, we used a systematic review method to comprehensively assess the efficacy of baicalein in animal PD models. By using electronic and manual search for the literatures, we identified studies describing the efficacy of baicalein in animal models of PD. RESULTS: We identified 16 studies describing the efficacy of baicalein in animal models of PD. The methodological quality of all preclinical trials is ranged from 2 to 5. 16 studies involved 4 main kinds of PD animal models. They are MPP+-induced, rotenone-induced, 6-OHDA-induced and acrolein-induced PD models, respectively. The protective effects of baicalein were studied mainly focusing on the anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory action. Beyond that, there are 2 articles describing the effects of baicalein on neurotransmitter balance in the basal ganglia, and 2 articles reporting the effects in decreasing synuclein aggregation. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of baicalein in PD experimental animals and analyzed the pharmacological mechanism. The information will be useful for the further development of baicalein into anti-PD agent and provide unbiased evidence for the conduct of clinical trials. In addition, such evaluation based on animal experiments can give us a general introduction to different animal models of PD, either guiding the further model tests, or avoiding the unnecessary replication.},

	abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ligusticum wallichii has been used to treat renal diseases for thousands of years in China. Ligustrazine (Lig) is the active ingredient of Ligusticum wallichii that possesses a variety of biological activities against kidney disease. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this review is to further evaluate whether the supplementation with Lig has an effect on improving renal pathology, renal function indexes and blood glucose levels in animal model of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Potential mechanisms of Lig for DN as well as the existing problems regarding the modeling method and limitations in this area of research were also summarized. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist was used to organize the search of eight databases from inception to June 2019. We used Cochrane Collaboration's 10-item checklist and Rev-Man 5.3 software to analyze the data as well as risk of bias. RESULTS: The study quality scores ranged from 2 to 6 points with an average of 4.471. Compared with the control group, Lig significantly improved pathological changes of kidney including glomeruli and tubules, and induced significant decreases in levels of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, 24-h urinary albumin and HbA1c, as well as increasing creatinine clearance rates. In subgroup analysis, the groups of high-dose STZ (≥60 mg/kg) and longer period of Lig treatment ({\textgreater}8 w) showed better results than those of the control group. No difference was seen between the high ({\textgreater}150 mg/kg, QD) and low (≤150 mg/kg, QD) dose of Lig treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Lig exerts renoprotective functions in an animal model of DN mediated by antioxidant action, inhibition of apoptosis, anti-inflammatory action, reduction of renal fibrosis, reduction of the proliferation of mesangial cells, inhibition of endotheliosis, inhibition of atherosclerosis and promotion of renal autophagy. The positive conclusion should be treated cautiously because of various methodological flaws. Further studies are recommended according to ARRIVE guidelines. The method of modeling with high-dose STZ should be avoided and improved STZ modeling schemes are recommended. Considering the large dosage range of Lig used clinically and in animals, the future studies on the basis of animal renal histology are urgently needed to determine the optimal dosages to delay histological changes. Nevertheless, together, our findings suggest that Lig is a renoprotective candidate drug for treatment of DN.},

	abstract = {China once suffered greatly from schistosomiasis japonica, a major zoonotic disease. Nearly 70 years of multidisciplinary efforts have achieved great progress in disease control, with infections in both humans and bovines significantly reduced to very low levels. However, reaching for the target of complete interruption of transmission at the country level by 2030 still faces great challenges, with areas of ongoing endemicity and/or re-emergence within previously 'eliminated' regions. The objectives of this study were, by using meta-analytical methods, to estimate the overall prevalence of Schistosoma japonicum infections in abundant commensal rodent species in mainland China after the introduction of praziquantel for schistosomiasis treatment in humans and bovines in 1980s. In doing so we thereby aimed to further assess the role of wild rodents as potential reservoirs in ongoing schistosome transmission. Published studies on infection prevalence of S. japonicum in wild rodents in mainland China since 1980 were searched across five electronic bibliographic databases and lists of article references. Eligible studies were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Risks of within and across study biases, and the variations in prevalence estimates attributable to heterogeneities were assessed. The pooled infection prevalence and its 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. We identified a total of 37 relevant articles involving 61 field studies which contained eligible data on 8,795 wild rodents across mainland China. The overall pooled infection prevalence was 3.86\% (95\% CI: 2.16-5.93\%). No significant change in the overall pooled prevalence was observed between 1980-2003 (n = 23 studies) and 2004-current (n = 38 studies). However, whilst the estimated prevalence decreased over time in the marshland and lake regions, there was an apparent increase in prevalence within hilly and mountainous regions. Among seven provinces, a significant prevalence reduction was only seen in Jiangsu where most endemic settings are classified as the marshland and lakes. These estimates changed over season, ranging from 0.58\% in spring to 22.39\% in winter, in association with increases in rodent density. This study systematically analyzed S. japonicum infections in wild rodents from the published literature over the last forty years after the introduction of praziquantel for schistosomiasis treatment in humans and bovines in 1980s. Although numbers of schistosomiasis cases in humans and bovines have been greatly reduced, no such comparable overall change of infection prevalence in rodents was detected. Furthermore, there appeared to be an increase in S. japonicum prevalence in rodents over time within hilly and mountainous regions. Rodents have been projected to become the dominant wildlife in human-driven environments and the main reservoir of zoonotic diseases in general within tropical zones. Our findings thus suggest that it is now necessary to include monitoring and evaluation of potential schistosome infection within rodents, particularly in hilly and mountainous regions, if we are ever to reach the new 2030 elimination goals and to maximize the impact of future public, and indeed One Health, interventions across, regional, national and international scales.},

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide and has complicated underlying pathophysiology. Numerous TBI animal models have been developed over the past decade to effectively mimic the human TBI pathophysiology. These models are of mostly mammalian origin including rodents and non-human primates. However, the mammalian models demanded higher costs and have lower throughput often limiting the progress in TBI research. Thus, this systematic review aims to discuss the potential benefits of non-mammalian TBI models in terms of their face validity in resembling human TBI. Three databases were searched as follows: PubMed, Scopus, and Embase, for original articles relating to non-mammalian TBI models, published between January 2010 and December 2019. A total of 29 articles were selected based on PRISMA model for critical appraisal. Zebrafish, both larvae and adult, was found to be the most utilized non-mammalian TBI model in the current literature, followed by the fruit fly and roundworm. In conclusion, non-mammalian TBI models have advantages over mammalian models especially for rapid, cost-effective, and reproducible screening of effective treatment strategies and provide an opportunity to expedite the advancement of TBI research.},

	abstract = {Background  Bleeding is a feared adverse event during anticoagulant treatment. In patients on vitamin K antagonists, most bleedings occur with the international normalized ratio (INR) in the therapeutic range. Currently, identification of high-risk patients via laboratory methods is not reliable. In this systematic review, we assessed the ability of calibrated automated thrombin generation (CAT-TG) to predict bleeding in patients on anticoagulant treatment. Methods  A systematic search was executed in three databases: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane. Results  Seven studies were included; two were of good methodological quality. One study showed that patients on warfarin with INRs in range (2-3) admitted for hemorrhage ( n  = 28), had lower CAT-TG levels (endogenous thrombin potential [ETP]: 333 ± 89 nM/min) than patients on warfarin admitted for other reasons (ETP: 436 ± 207 nM/min; p  {\textless} 0.001). Another study found no difference in ETP or peak levels between bleeding and nonbleeding patients in PPP or PRP. When measured in whole blood, both levels were significantly lower in patients with bleeding compared with nonbleeding patients (median [interquartile range, IQR] ETP: 182.5 [157.2-2,847 nM/min] vs. median [IQR] ETP: 256.2 [194.9-344.2 nM/min]; p  {\textless} 0.001) and median [IQR] peak: 23.9 [19.6-41.8 nM] vs. median [IQR] peak: 39.1 [24.9-53.2 nM]; p  {\textless} 0.05). From the remaining studies, four suggested that CAT-TG is more sensitive in detecting hemostatic abnormalities than INR and one article found ETP and INR to be equally useful. However, insufficient data were provided to validate these conclusions. Conclusion  Studies investigating the direct association between decreased CAT-TG values and hemorrhagic events are rare. Therefore, the clinical consequences of low CAT-TG values remain to be further investigated.},

	abstract = {The objective of this meta-analytical study was to investigate selected macrominerals, microminerals, and toxic heavy metals in the bovine whole-raw-milk (WRM) samples of published data. An analytical data set was constructed from 72 different studies from 37 countries with two types of production systems: a conventional production system (CPS) and an organic production system (OPS) compared with commercially available or retail-store-available milk (COM). Results of the meta-analytical study showed differences in the concentrations of macrominerals. Concentrations of Ca, Mg, K, and P were greater in the CPS samples, whereas Na was greater in the COM samples ( P {\textless} 0.05). Data also demonstrated that concentrations of microminerals like Cu, I, Fe, Mn, Se, and Zn in the organic WRM were lower ( P {\textless} 0.05) compared with the milk from CPS. The highest concentration of Ni was reported for COM ( P {\textless} 0.05); however, this value was below the minimum-risk level (MRL). Concentrations of heavy metals like As and Ni were greater in CPS milk than those in organic milk ( P {\textless} 0.05). In addition, there were greater concentrations of Cd and Pb in the WRM from CPS versus that from the organic farms. Concentration of Al was lowest in the OPS milk versus Al in the CPS which was 6.5-fold greater than in organic milk. The amount of Hg was below the MRL of 0.01 μmol/L for all production systems. A high variability was observed in the published data regarding the country of origin. Raw milk originating from Europe and North America was characterized by concentrations of macro- and microminerals below the MRLs as compared with that from specific countries, which had some minerals above the MRLs. For example, concentrations of Pb were above the MRL in the milk samples from Brazil, Croatia, Egypt, Mexico, Nigeria, Palestine, Romania, Serbia, and Turkey. Moreover, data from this study indicate that organic dairy farms are characterized by lower concentrations of toxic heavy metals in the WRM compared with those from CPS dairy farms.},

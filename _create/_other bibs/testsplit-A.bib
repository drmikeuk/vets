  abstract	= {BACKGROUND: Robopets are small animal-like robots which
		  have the appearance and behavioural characteristics of
		  pets. OBJECTIVE: To bring together the evidence of the
		  experiences of staff, residents and family members of
		  interacting with robopets and the effects of robopets on
		  the health and well-being of older people living in care
		  homes. DESIGN: Systematic review of qualitative and
		  quantitative research. DATA SOURCES: We searched 13
		  electronic databases from inception to July 2018 and
		  undertook forward and backward citation chasing. METHODS:
		  Eligible studies reported the views and experiences of
		  robopets from residents, family members and staff
		  (qualitative studies using recognised methods of
		  qualitative data collection and analysis) and the effects
		  of robopets on the health and well-being of care home
		  residents (randomised controlled trials, randomised
		  crossover trials and cluster randomised trials). Study
		  selection was undertaken independently by two reviewers. We
		  used the Wallace criteria and the Cochrane Risk of Bias
		  tool to assess the quality of the evidence. We developed a
		  logic model with stakeholders and used this as a framework
		  to guide data extraction and synthesis. Where appropriate,
		  we used meta-analysis to combine effect estimates from
		  quantitative studies. RESULTS: Nineteen studies (10
		  qualitative, 2 mixed methods and 7 randomised trials) met
		  the inclusion criteria. Interactions with robopets were
		  described as having a positive impact on aspects of
		  well-being including loneliness, depression and quality of
		  life by residents and staff, although there was no
		  corresponding statistically significant evidence from
		  meta-analysis for these outcomes. Meta-analysis showed
		  evidence of a reduction in agitation with the robopet
		  "Paro" compared to control (-0.32 [95\% CI -0.61 to -0.04,
		  p = 0.03]). Not everyone had a positive experience of
		  robopets. CONCLUSIONS: Engagement with robopets appears to
		  have beneficial effects on the health and well-being of
		  older adults living in care homes, but not all chose to
		  engage. Whether the benefits can be sustained are yet to be
		  investigated. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Robopets have the
		  potential to benefit people living in care homes, through
		  increasing engagement and interaction. With the robopet
		  acting as a catalyst, this engagement and interaction may
		  afford comfort and help reduce agitation and loneliness.},

  abstract	= {Brucellosis, known as Malta fever or Mediterranean fever,
		  is one of the most common bacterial zoonotic diseases
		  caused by Brucella spp. which can result in serious health
		  issues. The objective of the present study was to
		  systematically review and summarize the studies regarding
		  the prevalence of Brucella spp. in milk and milk products
		  in the Middle East region. Some international databases
		  (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google
		  Scholar) were searched to retrieve relevant reports
		  published between 1 January 2008 and 30th October 2018.
		  After assessing for eligibility, 30 articles containing
		  9281 samples, were included in the current study. The
		  highest number of publications were found in Iran and
		  Turkey (n = 12 and 7, respectively), while Saudi
		  Arabia, Kuwait, and Syria had the lowest number of
		  publications (n = 1). Besides, the highest and lowest
		  prevalence was observed in Kuwait (62\%) and Egypt (15\%),
		  respectively. The highest and lowest overall prevalence of
		  Brucella spp. in milk was found in raw cow milk 36\%
		  (95\%CI: 28-54\%) and raw buffalo milk 13\% (95\%CI:
		  -22-48\%), respectively. The overall prevalence in cheese
		  estimated to be 9\% (95\%CI: -16-35\%). The overall
		  prevalence of Brucella spp. in dairy products in the Middle
		  East was estimated to be 29\% (95\%CI: 23-35\%). The
		  results indicate that more risk management plans are needed
		  to reduce the incidence of Brucella spp. in dairy products
		  in the Middle East, especially in cow milk.},

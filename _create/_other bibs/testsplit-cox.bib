  abstract	= {The aquatic environment is increasingly bombarded by a
		  wide variety of noise pollutants whose range and intensity
		  are increasing with each passing decade. Yet, little is
		  known about how aquatic noise affects marine communities.
		  To determine the implications that changes to the
		  soundscape may have on fishes, a meta-analysis was
		  conducted focusing on the ramifications of noise on fish
		  behavior and physiology. Our meta-analysis identified 42
		  studies that produced 2,354 data points, which in turn
		  indicated that anthropogenic noise negatively affects fish
		  behavior and physiology. The most predominate responses
		  occurred within foraging ability, predation risk, and
		  reproductive success. Additionally, anthropogenic noise was
		  shown to increase the hearing thresholds and cortisol
		  levels of numerous species while tones, biological, and
		  environmental noise were most likely to affect complex
		  movements and swimming abilities. These findings suggest
		  that the majority of fish species are sensitive to changes
		  in the aquatic soundscape, and depending on the noise
		  source, species responses may have extreme and negative
		  fitness consequences. As such, this global synthesis should
		  serve as a warning of the potentially dire consequences
		  facing marine ecosystems if alterations to aquatic
		  soundscapes continue on their current trajectory.},

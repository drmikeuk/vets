	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimisation of trypanosomosis control programs warrants a good knowledge of the main vector of animal and human trypanosomes in sub-Saharan Africa, the tsetse fly. An important aspect of the tsetse fly population is its trypanosome infection prevalence, as it determines the intensity of the transmission of the parasite by the vector. We therefore conducted a systematic review of published studies documenting trypanosome infection prevalence from field surveys or from laboratory experiments under controlled conditions. Publications were screened in the Web of Science, PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Using the four-stage (identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion) process in the PRISMA statement the initial screened total of 605 studies were reduced to 72 studies. The microscopic examination of dissected flies (dissection method) remains the most used method to detect trypanosomes and thus constituted the main focus of this analysis. Meta-regression was performed to identify factors responsible for high trypanosome prevalence in the vectors and a random effects meta-analysis was used to report the sensitivity of molecular and serological tests using the dissection method as gold standard. RESULTS: The overall pooled prevalence was 10.3\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 8.1\%, 12.4\%) and 31.0\% (95\% CI = 20.0\%, 42.0\%) for the field survey and laboratory experiment data respectively. The country and the year of publication were found to be significantly factors associated with the prevalence of trypanosome infection in tsetse flies. The alternative diagnostic tools applied to dissection positive samples were characterised by low sensitivity, and no information on the specificity was available at all. CONCLUSION: Both temporal and spatial variation in trypanosome infection prevalence of field collected tsetse flies exists, but further investigation on real risk factors is needed how this variation can be explained. Improving the sensitivity and determining the specificity of these alternative diagnostic tools should be a priority and will allow to estimate the prevalence of trypanosome infection in tsetse flies in high-throughput.},

	abstract = {The objective of this project was to evaluate the effects of antimicrobials approved for parenteral metaphylactic use in feeder and stocker calves on morbidity and mortality for bovine respiratory disease with the use of a mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis. An initial literature review was conducted in April 2016 through Pubmed, Agricola, and CAB (Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau) for randomized controlled trials for metaphylaxis antimicrobial administered parentally to incoming feedlot or stocker calves within 48 h of arrival. The final list of publications included 29 studies, with a total of 37 trials. There were 8 different metaphylactic antimicrobials. Final event outcomes were categorized into bovine respiratory disease (BRD) morbidity cumulative incidence d 1 to {\textless}/= 60 of the feeding period, BRD morbidity cumulative incidence d 1 to closeout of the feeding period, BRD mortality cumulative incidence d 1 to closeout of the feeding period, and BRD retreatment cumulative incidence morbidity d 1 to closeout of the feeding period. Network meta-analysis combined direct and indirect evidence for all the event outcomes to determine mean odds ratio (OR) with 95\% credibility intervals (CrIs) for all metaphylactic antimicrobial comparisons. The "upper tier" treatment arms for morbidity d 1 to {\textless}/= 60 included tulathromycin, gamithromycin, and tilmicosin. For BRD mortality cumulative incidence d 1 to closeout and BRD retreatment morbidity d 1 to closeout, classifying the treatment arms into tiers was not possible due to overlapping 95\% CrIs. The results of this project accurately identified differences between metaphylactic antimicrobials, and metaphylactic antimicrobial options appear to offer different outcomes on BRD morbidity and mortality odds in feedlot cattle.},

DESIGN: Meta-analysis. SAMPLE POPULATION: Cattle, horses, goats, and sheep experimentally infected PO with Salmonella enterica subsp enterica. PROCEDURES: Online databases were searched for published reports describing results of experimental infection of cattle, horses, goats, and sheep PO with salmonellae. Time to detection of organisms in feces as well as to onset of diarrhea and pyrexia was noted. Analysis of covariance was used to examine relationships among these variables, host species and age, and Salmonella serovar and magnitude of infecting dose. RESULTS: Forty-three studies met the criteria for inclusion. Time to detection of salmonellae in feces ranged from 0.5 to 4 days. Times to onset of diarrhea and pyrexia ranged from 0.33 to 11 days and from 0.27 to 5 days, respectively. Time to onset of diarrhea was related to host age and Salmonella serovar. No other associations were identified. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Time to detection of salmonellae in feces is unreliable for identifying hospital-acquired infections; a 3-day criterion will misidentify hospital- versus community-acquired infections. Relying on clinical indices such as times to onset of diarrhea and pyrexia to trigger fecal sampling for detection of Salmonella infection will increase the risk of environmental contamination and nosocomial spread because animals may begin shedding organisms in feces several days prior.},

While articles about animal model infectivity have been published for G. duodenalis, the studies have used diverse protocols and parameters to evaluate the infectivity of this protozoan parasite. Hence, the objectives of this study were to (1) conduct a meta-analysis of published literature for cyst shedding and diarrhea outcomes in animal models and (2) develop recommendations to help standardize experimental dose response studies. Results showed that, for the outcome of cyst shedding in faeces, the covariates of infective stage (cyst versus trophozoite), Giardia dose, and the interactions between doses and infective stage, as well as dose and species of experimental host, were all significant (P value {\textless}/= 0.05). This study suggests inoculation of the experimental host with cysts rather than trophozoites and administration of higher doses of Giardia will most likely result in cyst shedding. Based on the results of this meta-analysis, the infective stage (cyst versus trophozoite), parasite dose, and the interactions between dose and infective stage, as well as dose and species of experimental host, should be considered when designing experimental dose response studies that will assist in the study of zoonotic neglected tropical diseases globally.},

The objectives of this study were to (1) conduct a meta-analysis of published literature for oocyst shedding and diarrhoea outcomes, and (2) develop recommendations for standardization of experimental dose-response studies. Results showed that for the outcome of oocyst shedding in faeces, the covariates 'experimental species', 'immunosuppression', 'oocyst dose' and 'oocyst dose' x 'age' were all significant (P 0.05). This study suggests that exposing mice, piglets, or ruminants, and using immunosuppressed experimental hosts, is more likely to result in oocyst shedding. For the outcome of diarrhoea in experimentally infected animal species, the key covariates 'experimental species', 'age' and 'immunosuppression' were significant (P 0.2). Therefore, based on the results of this meta-analysis, these variables should be carefully reported and considered when designing experimental dose-response studies. Additionally, detection of possible publication bias highlights the need to publish additional studies that convey statistically non-significant as well as significant results in the future.},

METHOD AND RESULTS: Relevant data were extracted from 159 research papers and findings were grouped into 14 sources of on-farm contamination and 37 contributing factors. A relevancy score was developed to take into account various measures from each study of applicability to GB broilers and strength of findings. Results indicate that major sources of Campylobacter include a depopulation event, another house on-farm, on-farm staff, and other animals on farm. The depopulation schedule (staggered slaughter) and multiple houses on-farm were identified as contributing factors associated with increasing the risk, and those decreasing the risk were use of a hygiene barrier, parent company and certain seasons of rearing. CONCLUSIONS: Although the review was more resource intensive compared to narrative studies, the system allows an increased level of transparency and the ability to investigate patterns and trends.

In Part One we reviewed the studies that compared these parameters between laying hens housed in aviaries and in conventional cages. In Part Two we investigated the relative impact of strain, beak trimming and rearing condition on productivity and mortality in aviaries. The comparative analysis revealed that aviary hens consumed 3.0\% more food than caged hens, and food conversion was 6.7\% higher in aviaries than in cages. On the other hand, the mortality rate and cannibalism rate did not differ significantly between the two housing systems. The analysis of causes of variation in productivity, mortality rate and cannibalism rate in aviaries revealed a strong effect of strain. Beak trimming was associated with a reduced prevalence of cannibalism rates but had no effect on overall mortality. It also reduced egg weight and food consumption. Early access to litter during the rearing period had a positive effect on egg weight; egg mass, food conversion and mortality rate. In conclusion, we found a slightly reduced productivity of aviaries in relation to cages although the mortality rates and the prevalence of cannibalism did not differ between these housing systems. To further improve productivity and reduce mortality of hens housed in aviaries we recommend the choice of suitable strains and the implementation of improved rearing conditions including early access to litter.},

	abstract = {Avian influenza or bird flu is a highly contagious acute viral disease that can occur in epidemics and cross-border forms in poultry and wild birds. The characteristics of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) allow the emergence of new viral variants, some with zoonotic and pandemic potential. AIVs have been identified in Latin America; however, there is a lack of understanding of these viruses at the regional level. We performed a systematic literature review on serological or molecular evidence of AIVs circulation in Latin America. Methods were designed based on the PRISMA and STROME guidelines. Only peer-reviewed studies published between 2000 to 2015 and data was analysed based on country, viral subtype, avian species, and phylogenetic origins. From 271 studies initially found only twenty-six met our inclusion criteria. Evidence of AIVs infection was found in most Latin American countries, with Mexico as the country with the largest number of conducted studies and reported cases during the period analysed, followed by Chile and Argentina. Most of the AIVs were early reported through surveillance systems and at least 14 different subtypes of influenza viruses were reported in birds, and the presence of both low (92.9\%) and high (7.1\%) pathogenic AIVs was shown in Latin America. Of the reported AIVs in Latin America, 43.7\% belong to migratory birds, 28.1\% to local wild birds, and 28.1\% to poultry. The migratory bird population mainly comprises families belonging to the orders Anseriformes and Charadriformes. We highlight the importance of epidemiological surveillance systems and the possible role of different migratory birds in the transmission of AIVs within the Americas. Our findings demonstrate the limited information on AIVs in Latin America and highlight the need of more studies on AIVs at the regional level, particularly those focused on identifying the endemic subtypes in regional wild birds.},

The objective was to compare the effect of trough or pasture FE on ADG, diet OM digestibility (OMD), various carcass characteristics, and the interaction between FE and complementation modalities. Liveweight was adjusted in order to compare results between species. Results showed that trough-fed animals had higher ADG (+17.89\%, P{\textless}0.001), hot carcass yield (HYield, + 2.47\%, P{\textless}0.001) and carcass fat content (+ 24.87\%, P{\textless}0.001) than pasture-fed animals but lower carcass muscle and bone percentages (-1.60\%, P=0.010 and -7.63\%, P=0.003, respectively). Feeding environment had no effect on diet OMD (P=0.818), but the number of observations was low. After integrating added concentrate (addiCO), FE effect persisted on ADG (P=0.024) and carcass fat content (P=0.027) but not on HYield (P=0.078) or muscle and bone percentages (P=0.119 and P=0.581, respectively). After integrating nature of the concentrate (natCO), FE effect persisted on ADG (P{\textless}0.001) and HYield (P=0.004). Integrating percentage of concentrate (PCO) erased FE effect on ADG (P=0.891) and HYield (P=0.128). In contrast, integrating quantity of concentrate (QCO) erased FE effect on ADG (P=0.084) but not on HYield (P=0.006) or on carcass fat and muscle contents (P=0.040 and P=0.040, respectively), although the FE effect on carcass bone content persisted (P=0.550). Animal species and physiological stage had no effect on any of the variables studied (P{\textgreater}0.05), but experiment did (P{\textless}/=0.001). The increase in ADG was positively correlated to HYield in cattle (P=0.002) and small ruminants (P=0.003) and positively linked to carcass fat content (P=0.007) but not carcass muscle content, which actually decreased (P=0.001). Overall, this meta-analysis confirmed previous reports of FE effects and revealed how the differences generally reported result from a confounding effect of FE and nature of the diet. Indeed, in most of the studies used, trough-fed animals were supplemented with concentrate whereas pasture-fed animals were not. This research also highlighted the fact that pasture-fed animals have the potential to achieve the same performances as trough-fed animals when fed a similar diet.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review was to assess the effects of repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids on lung and brain function and on growth restriction in animals. STUDY DESIGN: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for randomized controlled trials that compared repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids versus a single dose, with or without placebo, in pregnant animals. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included. The animals that were studied included sheep, monkeys, rabbits, and mice. There were 8 studies that assessed the effects of repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids on lung function. All the studies reported improvement in lung function after repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids. Seven studies investigated the effects of repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids on brain or nervous system function or growth; all the studies found adverse effects with repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids. Eleven studies looked at the effect of repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids on fetal growth. Nine studies found evidence of fetal growth restriction with repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids. One study assessed long-term behavioral outcomes in mice and found no effect. CONCLUSION: Evidence from randomized controlled trials in animals suggests that repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids may have beneficial effects in terms of lung function but may have adverse effects on brain function and fetal growth. Because of the differences between animals and humans, it is difficult to extrapolate directly the results of these studies to humans. Therefore, randomized controlled trials in humans are needed to assess the effects of repeated courses of antenatal corticosteroids for pregnant women who are at increased risk of preterm birth in terms of important perinatal, neonatal, and maternal outcomes.},

	abstract = {Campylobacter and antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter are frequently isolated from broiler chickens worldwide. In Canada, campylobacteriosis is the third leading cause of enteric disease and the regional emergence of ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter in broiler chickens has raised a public health concern. This study aimed to identify, critically appraise, and synthesize literature on sources of Campylobacter in broilers at the farm level using systematic review methodology. Literature searches were conducted in January 2012 and included electronic searches in four bibliographic databases. Relevant studies in French or English (n = 95) conducted worldwide in any year and all study designs were included. Risk of Bias and GRADE criteria endorsed by the Cochrane collaboration was used to assess the internal validity of the study and overall confidence in the meta-analysis. The categories for on-farm sources were: broiler breeders/vertical transfer (number of studies = 32), animals (n = 57), humans (n = 26), environment (n = 54), and water (n = 63). Only three studies examined the antimicrobial resistance profiles of Campylobacter from these on-farm sources. Subgroups of data by source and outcome were analyzed using random effect meta-analysis. The highest risk for contaminating a new flock appears to be a contaminated barn environment due to insufficient cleaning and disinfection, insufficient downtime, and the presence of an adjacent broiler flock. Effective biosecurity enhancements from physical barriers to restricting human movement on the farm are recommended for consideration to enhance local on-farm food safety programs. Improved sampling procedures and standardized laboratory testing are needed for comparability across studies. Knowledge gaps that should be addressed include farm-level drug use and antimicrobial resistance information, further evaluation of the potential for vertical transfer, and improved genotyping methods to strengthen our understanding of Campylobacter epidemiology in broilers at the farm-level. This systematic review emphasizes the importance of improved industry-level and on-farm risk management strategies to reduce pre-harvest Campylobacter in broilers.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine whether animal studies can reliably be used to determine the usefulness of methylprednisolone (MP) and other treatments for acute spinal cord injury (SCI) in humans. This was achieved by performing a systematic review of animal studies on the effects of MP administration on the functional outcome of acute SCI. Data were extracted from the published articles relating to: outcome; MP dosing regimen; species/strain; number of animals; methodological quality; type of injury induction; use of anaesthesia; functional scale used; and duration of follow-up. Subgroup analyses were performed, based on species or strain, injury method, MP dosing regimen, functional outcome measured, and methodological quality. Sixty-two studies were included, which involved a wide variety of animal species and strains. Overall, beneficial effects of MP administration were obtained in 34\% of the studies, no effects in 58\%, and mixed results in 8\%. The results were inconsistent both among and within species, even when attempts were made to detect any patterns in the results through subgroup analyses. The results of this study demonstrate the barriers to the accurate prediction from animal studies of the effectiveness of MP in the treatment of acute SCI in humans. This underscores the need for the development and implementation of validated testing methods.},

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of parity on the rates of dystocia and stillbirth. A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the impact of first parity (primiparous) and later parities (multiparous) on dystocia and stillbirth in Holstein cattle. A total of 30 and 19 papers were analyzed for evaluation of two traits. Results revealed that primiparous cattle are more susceptible to dystocia [Odds Ratio (OR)=2.68, 95\% Confidence interval (CI) 2.51 to 2.85], stillbirth (OR=2.18, 95\% CI 1.84 to 2.58) as compared with multiparous. These results supported the opinion about the importance of considering primiparous and multiparous as different traits in genetic evaluation and shed light on the importance of improving genetics and environment of heifers to minimize the effect of dystocia and stillbirth in Holstein cattle.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an important but neglected bacterial zoonosis that has been largely overlooked in Africa. In this systematic review, we aimed to summarise and compare current knowledge of: (1) the geographic distribution, prevalence, incidence and diversity of acute human leptospirosis in Africa; and (2) the geographic distribution, host range, prevalence and diversity of Leptospira spp. infection in animal hosts in Africa. METHODS: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched for studies that described (1) acute human leptospirosis and (2) pathogenic Leptospira spp. infection in animals. We performed a literature search using eight international and regional databases for English and non-English articles published between January 1930 to October 2014 that met out pre-defined inclusion criteria and strict case definitions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We identified 97 studies that described acute human leptospirosis (n = 46) or animal Leptospira infection (n = 51) in 26 African countries. The prevalence of acute human leptospirosis ranged from 2 3\% to 19 8\% (n = 11) in hospital patients with febrile illness. Incidence estimates were largely restricted to the Indian Ocean islands (3 to 101 cases per 100,000 per year (n = 6)). Data from Tanzania indicate that human disease incidence is also high in mainland Africa (75 to 102 cases per 100,000 per year). Three major species (Leptospira borgpetersenii, L. interrogans and L. kirschneri) are predominant in reports from Africa and isolates from a diverse range of serogroups have been reported in human and animal infections. Cattle appear to be important hosts of a large number of Leptospira serogroups in Africa, but few data are available to allow comparison of Leptospira infection in linked human and animal populations. We advocate a 'One Health' approach to promote multidisciplinary research efforts to improve understanding of the animal to human transmission of leptospirosis on the African continent.},

	abstract = {There are numerous treatments for correction of dorsal displacement of the soft palate (DDSP). However, the efficacy of these treatments is controversial and there is little consensus on how best to treat this condition. The aims of this study were to systematically review the literature and to assess the evidence on the clinical effects of interventions for dynamic intermittent DDSP. A secondary objective was to assess whether factors relating to study quality affected reported success rates. Twenty-three studies were included, covering a wide number of interventions but also differing widely is terms of study design, sample size, method of diagnosis, outcome measure and the number lost to follow-up. The assessment of adverse effects was severely limited because of lack of reporting. The way in which success is measured appears to have a great effect on the reported results. Research synthesis has been severely limited because of the heterogeneity in the included studies. The low level of evidence makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions as to the efficacy of procedures for DDSP. Hence it is currently not possible to determine which procedure is the most appropriate. This systematic review highlights the difficulties of studying palatal dysfunction and suggests areas where improvements can be made in future studies.},

A total of 85 articles published between 1968 and 2010 were used, totaling 1012 treatments and 13 196 animals. The meta-analysis followed three sequential analyses: graphical, correlation and variance-covariance. The presence of mycotoxins in diets was seen to reduce the feed intake by 18\% and the weight gain in 21\% compared with the control group. Deoxynivalenol and aflatoxins were the mycotoxins with the greatest impact on the feed intake and growth of pigs, reducing by 26\% and 16\% in the feed intake and by 26\% and 22\% in the weight gain. The mycotoxin concentration in diets and the animal age at challenge were the variables that more improved the coefficient of determination in equations for estimating the effect of mycotoxins on weight gain. The mycotoxin effect on growth proved to be greater in younger animals. In addition, the residual analysis showed that the greater part of the variation in weight gain was explained by the variation in feed intake (87\%). The protein and methionine levels in diets could influence the feed intake and the weight gain in challenged animals. The weight gain in challenged pigs showed a positive correlation with the methionine level in diets (0.68). The mycotoxin effect on growth was greater in males compared with the effect on females. The reduction in weight gain was of 15\% in the female group and 19\% in the male group. Mycotoxin presence in pig diets has interfered in the relative weight of the liver, the kidneys and the heart. Mycotoxins have an influence on performance and organ weight in pigs. However, the magnitude of the effects varies with the type and concentration of mycotoxin, sex and the animal age, as well as nutritional factors.},

	abstract = {Monensin is a widely used feed additive with the potential to minimize methane (CH4) emissions from cattle. Several studies have investigated the effects of monensin on CH4, but findings have been inconsistent. The objective of the present study was to conduct meta-analyses to quantitatively summarize the effect of monensin on CH4 production (g/d) and the percentage of dietary gross energy lost as CH4 (Ym) in dairy cows and beef steers. Data from 22 controlled studies were used. Heterogeneity of the monensin effects were estimated using random effect models. Due to significant heterogeneity ({\textgreater}68\%) in both dairy and beef studies, the random effect models were then extended to mixed effect models by including fixed effects of DMI, dietary nutrient contents, monensin dose, and length of monensin treatment period. Monensin reduced Ym from 5.97 to 5.43\% and diets with greater neutral detergent fiber contents (g/kg of dry matter) tended to enhance the monensin effect on CH4 in beef steers. When adjusted for the neutral detergent fiber effect, monensin supplementation [average 32 mg/kg of dry matter intake (DMI)] reduced CH4 emissions from beef steers by 19 +/- 4 g/d. Dietary ether extract content and DMI had a positive and a negative effect on monensin in dairy cows, respectively. When adjusted for these 2 effects in the final mixed-effect model, monensin feeding (average 21 mg/kg of DMI) was associated with a 6 +/- 3 g/d reduction in CH4 emissions in dairy cows. When analyzed across dairy and beef cattle studies, DMI or monensin dose (mg/kg of DMI) tended to decrease or increase the effect of monensin in reducing methane emissions, respectively. Methane mitigation effects of monensin in dairy cows (-12 +/- 6 g/d) and beef steers (-14 +/- 6 g/d) became similar when adjusted for the monensin dose differences between dairy cow and beef steer studies. When adjusted for DMI differences, monensin reduced Ym in dairy cows (-0.23 +/- 0.14) and beef steers (-0.33 +/- 0.16). Monensin treatment period length did not significantly modify the monensin effects in dairy cow or beef steer studies. Overall, monensin had stronger antimethanogenic effects in beef steers than dairy cows, but the effects in dairy cows could potentially be improved by dietary composition modifications and increasing the monensin dose.},

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review. METHODS: An on-line bibliographic search through Medline, PubMed, Veterinary Information Network, and Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau Abstracts was performed during August 2004. Two hundred and forty resources of information were identified. Studies were compared and evaluated with regard to study design (retrospective, prospective, randomization), surgical technique, short- and long-term follow-up, and evidence classification. RESULTS: Twenty-eight resources qualified to assist with evidence classification. No class I or class II studies were present, 5 studies were categorized as a class III and 23 studies were categorized as a class IV. Seventeen studies were retrospectively designed and 11 studies were prospectively designed. Proposed results ranged from a wide variety of subjective findings including clinical impression, radiographic analysis, synovial fluid analysis, gross pathology, and histopathology. Objective results, although infrequent, included force plate analysis and cadaveric biomechanical testing. CONCLUSIONS: At this time, the application of evidence-based medicine in analyzing the current available evidence suggests that there is not a single surgical procedure that has enough data to recommend that it can consistently return dogs to normal function after CCL injury. The requirement for assessing and categorizing the available evidence becomes increasingly important as more data becomes available and the quality of research improves. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: An evidence-based medicine paradigm did not provide sufficient evidence favoring 1 surgical technique for management of canine CCL injury.},

The analysis consisted of the following: study design rating, quality factor rating, quantity rating, consistency rating, relevance to disease risk reduction rating, and cumulative strength of evidence ranking. RESULTS: 4 trials evaluating meloxicam were rated as type I. Three trials evaluating carprofen were rated as type I, and 2 trials were rated as type III. One trial evaluating each of the following agents was rated as type 1: etodolac; P54FP; polysulfated glycosaminoglycan; and a combination of chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, and manganese ascorbate. Two trials evaluating pentosan polysulphate and 2 trails evaluating green-lipped mussels were rated as type I. One trial evaluating hyaluronan was rated as type III. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A high level of comfort exists for meloxicam that the claimed relationship is scientifically valid and that its use is clinically efficacious for the treatment of osteoarthritis in dogs. A moderate level of comfort exists for carprofen; etodolac; pentosan polysulphate; green-lipped mussels; P54FP; polysulfated glycosaminoglycans; and a combination of chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, and manganese ascorbate. An extremely low level of comfort exists for hyaluronan.},

	abstract = {The study was carried out to elaborate response surface models through broiler performance data recovered from literature in order to predict performance and develop economic analysis. Three hundred and twenty eight studies published between 2005 and 2009 were retrieved using the systematic review of literature method. Average weight gain and feed intake data were collected from twelve studies that fulfilled the preestablished inclusion criteria, and response surface models were adjusted with metabolizable energy, environmental temperature, and slaughter age as independent variables. The models for weight gain (R²=0.88) and feed conversion (R²=0.87) were accurate, precise, and not biased. There was no interaction between metabolizable energy and environmental temperature on weight gain and feed intake. The independent variables age and temperature showed interaction for weight gain and feed conversion, whereas the interaction between age and metabolizable energy was detected only for weight gain. It was possible to elaborate economic analysis to determine maximum profit, as a function of the variables included in the model, in different market situations determined by changes in broiler and feed prices. Response surface models are effective to predict broiler chickens performance and allow the development of economic analysis to optimize profitability according to market prices.},

	abstract = {The honey bee Apis mellifera, the test species used in the current environmental risk assessment procedure, is generally considered as extremely sensitive to pesticides when compared to other bee species, although a quantitative approach for comparing the difference in sensitivity among bees has not yet been reported. A systematic review of the relevant literature on the topic followed by a meta-analysis has been performed. Both the contact and oral acute LD50 and the chronic LC50 reported in laboratory studies for as many substances as possible have been extracted from the papers in order to compare the sensitivity to pesticides of honey bees and other bee species (Apiformes). The sensitivity ratio R between the endpoint for the species a (A. mellifera) and the species s (bees other than A. mellifera) was calculated for a total of 150 case studies including 19 bee species. A ratio higher than 1 indicated that the species s was more sensitive to pesticides than honey bees. The meta-analysis showed a high variability of sensitivity among bee species (R from 0.001 to 2085.7), however, in approximately 95 \% of the cases the sensitivity ratio was below 10. The effect of pesticides in domestic and wild bees is dependent on the intrinsic sensitivity of single bee species as well as their specific life cycle, nesting activity and foraging behaviour. Current data indicates a need for more comparative information between honey bees and non-Apis bees as well as separate pesticide risk assessment procedures for non-Apis bees.},

	abstract = {The collective treatment (CT) of an affected herd is commonly advised to control bovine digital dermatitis (DD). Several CT are commercialized, frequently without major evidence supporting their effectiveness. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the published evidence that supports CT in the treatment and prevention of DD lesions in dairy herds. Across the evidence, the main limitations in the studies design were identified and the possible sources of inconsistency were investigated. An extensive literature search of publications through electronic databases and gray literature was conducted between July 2015 and January 2016. Studies that did not include an untreated or placebo control group were excluded from the review. The literature search and screening process identified 13 publications with 24 treatment trial comparisons and 18 prevention trial comparisons. The published evidence included studies mostly considered to have a low or unclear risk of bias. Descriptive analyses were performed according to the prevention and treatment outcomes, and case and success definitions were identified for each study and summarized in odds ratios (OR). Pairwise meta-analyses were conducted according to the prevention and treatment outcomes, comparing directly the intervention used in each study, and ignoring any other differences in the intervention characteristics. The results of the meta-analyses indicated a low degree of heterogeneity across the evidence for the prevention outcome [I2 = 0\%, 95\% CI: 0 to 37.2\%, 95\% prediction interval (PI): 0.72 to 1.74)] and a moderate degree for the treatment outcome (I2 = 25.3\%, 95\% CI: 0 to 63\%, 95\% PI: 0.39 to 3.73). Similarly, appraisal of the graphical L'Abbe plot suggested a considerable degree of heterogeneity across the evidence for the treatment outcome. For both outcomes, the frequent small sample sizes of the trials indicate imprecision across the included studies. Additionally, for the treatment and prevention outcomes, an asymmetric funnel plot suggested possible publication bias. The overall quality of the evidence, for both outcomes (prevention and treatment), was therefore considered to be low, indicating that the true effect of CT may be substantially different from that estimated across the included studies. Consequently, this review and meta-analysis does not support an association between the CT considered in the review and a beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of DD lesions. The effectiveness of CT therefore remains uncertain, and the epidemiological circumstances in which it can be useful must be investigated. These findings highlight the importance of developing high quality, controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of CT for DD control.},

	abstract = {The prenatal period is of critical importance in defining how individuals respond to their environment throughout life. Stress experienced by pregnant females has been shown to have detrimental effects on offspring biology in humans and a variety of other species. It also is becoming increasingly apparent that prenatal events can have important consequences for the behavior, health, and productivity of offspring in farmed species. Pregnant cattle may experience many potentially important stressors, for instance, relating to their social environment, housing system and physical environment, interactions with humans and husbandry procedures, and their state of health. We examined the available literature to provide a review of the implications of prenatal stress for offspring welfare in cattle. The long-term effects of dystocia on cattle offspring also are reviewed. To ensure a transparent and repeatable selection process, a systematic review approach was adopted. The research literature clearly demonstrates that prenatal stress and difficult births in beef and dairy cattle both have implications for offspring welfare and performance. Common husbandry practices, such as transport, were shown to influence offspring biology and the importance of environmental variables, including thermal stress and drought, also were highlighted. Maternal disease during pregnancy was shown to negatively impact offspring welfare. Moreover, dystocia-affected calves suffer increased mortality and morbidity, decreased transfer of passive immunity, and important physiological and behavioral changes. This review also identified considerable gaps in our knowledge and understanding of the effects of prenatal stress in cattle.},

	abstract = {Over time, much knowledge has been accumulated about the active role of the urothelium, principally in rodents and human. Far from being a mere passive barrier, this specialized epithelium can alter the ion and protein composition of the urine, is able to sense and respond to mechanical stimuli such as pressure, and react to mechanical stimuli by epithelial cell communication with the nervous system. Most of the specialized functions of the urothelium are linked to a number of morpho-physiologic properties exhibited by the superficial umbrella cells, including specialized membrane lipids, asymmetric unit membrane particles and a plasmalemma with stiff plaques which function as a barrier to most substances found in urine, thus protecting the underlying tissues. Moreover, the entire mucosa lining the low urinary tract, composed of urothelium and sub-urothelium, forms a functional transduction unit, able to respond to eso- and endogenous physical and chemical stimuli in a manner assuring an adequate functional response. This review will summarize the available information on each area of inquiry from a morpho-functional point of view. Possible considerations pertaining to species of veterinary interest are reviewed as well. The review was prepared consulting the electronic databases PubMed and Cab Abstracts and retrieving all pertinent reports and the relative reference lists, in order to identify any potential additional studies that could be included. Full-length research articles and thematic reviews were considered. Information on the urothelium of some domestic animal species was also included.},

Two independent reviewers completed relevancy screening, data extraction, and synthesis of results using Kirkpatrick and Kirkpatrick's framework. The search retrieved 1,583 articles, and 10 met the final inclusion criteria. We identified no published articles on Web-based communication platforms in veterinary medicine; however, publications summarized from human medicine demonstrated that WBL provides a potentially reliable and valid approach for teaching and assessing communication skills. Student feedback on the use of virtual patients for teaching clinical communication skills has been positive, though evidence has suggested that practice with virtual patients prompted lower relation-building responses. Empirical outcomes indicate that WBL is a viable method for expanding the approach to teaching history taking and possibly to additional tasks of the veterinary medical interview.},

The effect of maternal nutrition can be exerted at all stages of fetal development, from conception until birth. A meta-analysis of maternal nutrition effects on the growth and reproductive development of male sheep offspring was undertaken using sixteen sheep studies. Eleven studies were included for prediction of the growth curves using a logistic growth model, and eleven studies were included for reproductive development and analysed using a mixed model. The meta-analysis suggested that, male sheep offspring undernourished during gestation had a significantly slower growth and lower testosterone levels while there were no statistically significant effects on testis weight, seminiferous tubule diameter or Sertoli cell count. The lack of a statistical effect on seminiferous tubule diameter and Sertoli cell count may be due to the limited number of studies examining the effects of maternal nutrition during pregnancy on male sheep offspring reproductive development. The meta-analysis reported here suggests that additional studies are warranted to more conclusively determine whether maternal nutrition during pregnancy effects male sheep growth and reproductive development.},

	abstract = {Vector-borne diseases are among major health constraints of small ruminant in Ethiopia. While various studies on single vector-borne diseases or presence of vectors have been conducted, no summarized evidence is available on the occurrence of these diseases and the related vectors. This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive summary on major vectors and vector-borne diseases in small ruminants in Ethiopia. Search for published and unpublished literature was conducted between 8th of January and 25th of June 2015. The search was both manual and electronic. The databases used in electronic search were PubMed, Web of Science, CAB Direct and AJOL. For most of the vector-borne diseases, the summary was limited to narrative synthesis due to lack of sufficient data. Meta-analysis was computed for trypanosomosis and dermatophilosis while meta-regression and sensitivity analysis was done only for trypanososmosis due to lack of sufficient reports on dermatophilosis. Owing emphasis to their vector role, ticks and flies were summarized narratively at genera/species level. In line with inclusion criteria, out of 106 initially identified research reports 43 peer-reviewed articles passed the quality assessment. Data on 7 vector-borne diseases were extracted at species and region level from each source. Accordingly, the pooled prevalence estimate of trypanosomosis was 3.7\% with 95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.8, 4.9), while that of dermatophilosis was 3.1\% (95\% CI: 1.6, 6.0). The in-between study variance noted for trypanosomosis was statistically significant (p{\textless}0.05). Among the three covariates considered for meta-regression, only one (species) fitted the final model significantly (p{\textless}0.05) and explained 65.44\% of the between studies variance (R2). The prevalence in sheep (5.5\%) increased nearly by 34\% compared to goats (2.9\%). The parasitic presence in blood was documented for babesiosis (3.7\% in goats); and anaplasmosis (3.9\% in sheep). Serological evidence was retrieved for bluetongue ranging from 34.1\% to 46.67\% in sheep, and coxiellosis was 10.4\% in goats. There was also molecular evidence on the presence of theileriosis in sheep (93\%, n=160) and goats (1.9\%, n=265). Regarding vectors of veterinary importance, 14 species of ticks in five genera, four species of Glossina and 4 genera of biting flies were reported. Despite the evidence on presence of various vectors including ticks, flies, mosquitoes and midges, studies on vector-borne diseases in Ethiopia are surprisingly rare, especially considering risks related to climate change, which is likely to affect distribution of vectors. Thus better evidence on the current situation is urgently needed in order to prevent spread and to model future distribution scenarios.},

	abstract = {Mange mites are economically important ectoparasites of sheep and goats responsible for rejection or downgrading of skins in tanneries or leather industries in Ethiopia. The objective of this systematic review was to compute the pooled prevalence estimate and identify factors influencing mange mite prevalence in sheep and goats at national level based on the available research evidence. Articles on mange mite infestation of small ruminants in Ethiopia were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, Google scholar and African journals on-line. The review was based on 18 cross-sectional studies carried out between 2003 and 2015 in four administrative states of Ethiopia. Accordingly, the pooled prevalence estimate in a random effects meta-analysis was estimated to be 4.4\% (95\% CI 3.0, 6.3) although there were evidence of a substantial amount of between-study variance (I(2)=98.4\%). In subgroup and multivariable meta-regression analyses, animal species, agro-ecology and administrative state were found to have significant effect on the prevalence estimate (P{\textless}0.05) and explained 32.87\% of the explainable proportion of the heterogeneity noted between studies The prevalence was found to be higher in goats in lowland agro-ecology. Region wise the highest estimate was calculated for Amhara (6.4\%) followed by Oromia (4.7\%), Tigray (3.6\%) and Southern Nations, Nationalities and People Region (SNNPR) (3.1\%). Significant difference was noted between Amhara and SNNPR. The study further revealed that mites of the genus Sarcoptes, Demodex and Psoroptes are the most prevalent mites infesting small ruminants in Ethiopia. Valid studies were lacking from five regional states. As some of these regions are known for their large small ruminant population, further studies are warranted to produce better picture of the infestation at a national level. Meanwhile, the need for monitoring the ongoing control intervention is suggested.},

It also attempts to identify study-level variables that could explain the variation in apparent seroprevalence. The literature search was restricted to studies published in English language from January 2000 to December 2013. A template was designed to retrieve the most biologically plausible and consistent variables from the articles. A total of 29 published papers containing 40 animal-level studies were used in the analyses. The single-group summary of Brucella seroprevalence in cattle was estimated to reach 3.3 \% with 95 \% confidence interval (CI) (2.6-4.2 \%). Of all the variables considered, region was the only specific factor identified to explain about 20 \% of between-study variation. Accordingly, the region-based meta-analysis forest plot revealed the highest prevalence in central Ethiopia followed by southern part. The lowest prevalence estimate was observed in the western part of the country. The visual inspection of the funnel plot demonstrated the presence of possible publication bias which might dictate shortage of studies with higher prevalences or variance inflation due to infectiousness of Brucella. In conclusion, the quantitative review showed the seroprevalence to be low but widely distributed. More importantly, the review underscores the need for isolation and characterization of the circulating Brucella spp. to capture the type of Brucella spp. involved and its distribution in cattle in Ethiopia.},

The reported GI nematodes represented eleven genera affecting sheep and goats including: Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus, Teladorsagia/Ostertagia, Strongyloides, Bunostomum, Nematodirus, Chabertia, Trichuris, Cooperia, Skrjabinema and Oesophagostomum. The GI nematodes pooled prevalence estimate in the random effect model was 75.8\% (95\% CI: 69.6, 80.8). The subgroup analysis revealed significant (p{\textless}0.05) differences in the prevalence between different regions and type of diagnostic methods used. 'Postmortem technique' and 'eastern part of the country' were associated with higher GI nematode prevalence and accounted for 68.1\% of the between studies heterogeneity. In light of the high parasitic prevalence in all agro-ecologies, the need for strategic intervention is recommended. Meanwhile, data need to be generated for some of the regions where dependable survey reports are lacking.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis, using information from 45 experiments on growing-finishing pigs published in 39 manuscripts, was carried out to determine the simultaneous effects of the physical environment (space allowance, group size, flooring conditions, temperature, presence of enrichment), pig traits (initial body weight (BW) for each studied time interval, sex, genetics), feeder characteristics (water provision within the feeder, feeder design (individual/collective), feeder places/pig, presence of feeder protection) and feed characteristics (feed allowance (ad libitum/restricted), net energy content, crude protein (CP) content), as well as their potential interactions, on the feeding behaviour and performance of growing-finishing pigs. The detrimental effect of low temperature on performance was particularly evident for restricted-fed pigs (P {\textless} 0.05). At reduced feeder space allowance, a reduction in the percentage of time spent eating was predicted when increasing initial BW, whereas the opposite was predicted for larger feeder space allowances (P {\textless} 0.001). The reduction in visit duration to the feeder in higher BW groups became gradually more important with increasing feeder space allowance (P {\textless} 0.01), whereas the increase in the ingestion rate and average daily feed intake (ADFI) with increasing initial BW became smaller with increasing feeder space (P {\textless} 0.05). The model predicted a reduction in feed conversion ratio (FCR) with increasing group size (P {\textless} 0.05) and floor space allowance (P {\textless} 0.01) and on solid floors with or without bedding (P {\textless} 0.05). In comparison with other feeders, wet/dry feeders were associated with more frequent but shorter feeder visits (P {\textless} 0.05), higher ingestion rates (P {\textless} 0.001) and higher ADFI (P {\textless} 0.10). The use of protection within individual feeders increased the time spent feeding (P {\textless} 0.001), reduced the number of visits per day (P {\textless} 0.01), the ingestion rate (P {\textless} 0.001) and FCR (P {\textless} 0.01) in comparison with other feeder types. Sex modulated the effect of the number of feeder places/pig on FCR (P {\textless} 0.05), with a gradual reduction of FCR in entire males and females when increasing feeder space allowance. Genetics tended to modulate the effect of diets' CP content on FCR (P {\textless} 0.10). Overall, these results may contribute to the improvement of the welfare and performance of growing-finishing pigs by a better knowledge of the influence of the rearing environment and may help optimize the feeding strategies in current production systems.},

Data from 22 experiments reported in 21 scientific publications were collected. The space allowance, expressed on an allometric basis by means of a \_k\_-value (m²/BW⁰[super:.]⁶⁶⁷), the group size (\_n\_) and the floor characteristics (fully and partly slatted \_v.\_ non-slatted floor), as well as their significant two-way interactions were used as fixed effects, and the experiment was used as a random factor to take into account the interexperiment effect. Further regression analyses were performed on the predicted values of observations in order to improve the adjustment of data. A significant quadratic relationship was established between space allowance (\_k\_-value, \_P\_{\textless}0.05; squared \_k\_-value, \_P\_{\textless}0.01) and the percentage of time spent lying. A significant interaction between the \_k\_-value and the floor type was also found (\_P\_{\textless}0.05), showing that the relationship between space allowance and lying behaviour is affected by the presence or absence of slats. Threshold \_k\_-values were obtained using broken-line analyses, being about 0.039 for slatted floors and almost double for non-slatted floors. Compared to other studies, these values suggest that the ability to rest as space availability decreases may be compromised before a reduced performance becomes apparent. Group size did not show a significant effect. Additional information should be added to the model, as further data become available, to adjust the proposed parameters as well as to try to include the effect of other important aspects such as that of ambient temperature.},

	abstract = {To quantify the combined effect of housing conditions and environmental enrichment on the behaviour and performance of pigs, a meta-analysis was performed using information from 45 experiments in 42 published manuscripts. Multiple regression models were applied to evaluate the effects of space allowance per pig (\_k\_-value; m²/BW⁰[super:.]⁶⁶⁷), group size (\_n\_), floor characteristics (solid, partly, or totally slatted floor), bedding (presence or absence), and the number and presentation sequence of point-source objects (no object, one object, two simultaneous objects, two alternated objects, three or more simultaneous objects or three or more alternated objects) on the general activity, enrichment and object-directed exploratory behaviour, social behaviour, and productive performance. A non-linear relationship between space allowance per pig and time spent sitting and lying was found (\_P\_{\textless}0.10 and \_P\_{\textless}0.01 for the \_k\_-value and its quadratic term respectively). Total time spent in exploration increased with space allowance per pig when bedding was present (\_P\_{\textless}0.01), and time spent exploring other pen items decreased with increasing space allowance per pig if no bedding was provided (\_P\_{\textless}0.001). Total time spent in exploration increased with group size (\_P\_{\textless}0.001). The lowest predicted total exploration time (least squares mean+or-standard error) was found in the absence of bedding and point-source objects (13+or-3\%; \_P\_{\textless}0.05), and the highest when bedding (18+or-3\%) or point-source objects (19+or-3\%) were present. Time exploring point-source objects was higher when different objects were provided (\_P\_{\textless}0.001). Suspended (\_P\_{\textless}0.05) and deformable (\_P\_{\textless}0.05) enrichment items increased the time spent manipulating them. Time spent exploring point-source objects was predicted to be higher in the absence of slats and bedding (32+or-6\%; \_P\_{\textless}0.05), and lower when bedding (8+or-9\%) or slats (12+or-4\%) were present. Time engaged in negative social behaviours decreased in the presence of point-source objects (\_P\_{\textless}0.01), and increased with group size in the absence of bedding (\_P\_{\textless}0.001). Time engaged in positive social behaviours tended to decrease in the presence of point-source objects (\_P\_{\textless}0.10), and when space allowance per pig increased in the absence of bedding (\_P\_{\textless}0.10). Slight trends towards lower FCR were predicted when point-source objects (\_P\_{\textless}0.10) and bedding (\_P\_=0.10) were present.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in calves and piglets lead to significant economic losses in livestock husbandry. A high morbidity has been reported for diarrhea (calves {\textless}/= 35\%; piglets {\textless}/= 50\%) and for respiratory diseases (calves {\textless}/= 80\%; piglets {\textless}/= 40\%). Despite a highly diverse etiology and pathophysiology of these diseases, treatment with antimicrobials is often the first-line therapy. Multi-antimicrobial resistance in pathogens results in international accordance to strengthen the research in novel treatment options. Medicinal plants bear a potential as alternative or additional treatment. Based on the versatile effects of their plant specific multi-component-compositions, medicinal plants can potentially act as 'multi-target drugs'. Regarding the plurality of medicinal plants, the aim of this systematic review was to identify potential medicinal plant species for prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases and for modulation of the immune system and inflammation in calves and piglets. RESULTS: Based on nine initial sources including standard textbooks and European ethnoveterinary studies, a total of 223 medicinal plant species related to the treatment of gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases was identified. A defined search strategy was established using the PRISMA statement to evaluate 30 medicinal plant species starting from 20'000 peer-reviewed articles published in the last 20 years (1994-2014). This strategy led to 418 references (257 in vitro, 84 in vivo and 77 clinical trials, thereof 48 clinical trials in veterinary medicine) to evaluate effects of medicinal plants and their efficacy in detail. The findings indicate that the most promising candidates for gastrointestinal diseases are Allium sativum L., Mentha x piperita L. and Salvia officinalis L.; for diseases of the respiratory tract Echinacea purpurea (L.) MOENCH, Thymus vulgaris L. and Althea officinalis L. were found most promising, and Echinacea purpurea (L.) MOENCH, Camellia sinensis (L.) KUNTZE, Glycyrrhiza glabra L. and Origanum vulgare L. were identified as best candidates for modulation of the immune system and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Several medicinal plants bear a potential for novel treatment strategies for young livestock. There is a need for further research focused on gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in calves and piglets, and the findings of this review provide a basis on plant selection for future studies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To critically evaluate and summarize available information on the safety of potassium bromide in dogs. DESIGN: Systematic review. SAMPLE: 111 references reporting safety information relevant to potassium bromide published between 1938 and 2011. PROCEDURES: PubMed searches without date limitations were conducted with the terms "potassium bromide" and "sodium bromide" in December 2009 and October 2011. Additional articles were identified through examination of article reference lists and book chapters on seizures in dogs and pharmacology. RESULTS: Reversible neurologic signs were the most consistently reported toxicoses and were generally associated with adjunctive potassium bromide treatment or high serum bromide concentrations. Dermatologic and respiratory abnormalities were rare in dogs. Insufficient information was available to assess the effects of potassium bromide on behavior or to determine the incidence of vomiting, weight gain, polyphagia, pancreatitis, polyuria, polydipsia, or reproductive abnormalities associated with potassium bromide administration. Evidence suggested that administration of potassium bromide with food may alleviate gastrointestinal irritation and that monitoring for polyphagia, thyroid hormone abnormalities, and high serum bromide concentrations may be beneficial. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggested that potassium bromide is not an appropriate choice for treatment of every dog with seizures and that practitioners should tailor therapeutic regimens and clinical monitoring to each dog. Abrupt dietary changes or fluid therapy may compromise seizure control or increase the likelihood of adverse events. Availability of an appropriately labeled, approved potassium bromide product could provide better assurance for veterinarians and their clients of the quality, safety, and effectiveness of the product for veterinary use.},

	abstract = {Conservation efforts to better understand how wildlife populations respond to environmental change and anthropogenic disturbance has led to a proliferation of research examining physiological indicators of stress response in wildlife. Glucocorticoid stress hormones (GCs), typically cortisol and corticosterone, are among the most frequently measured indicators of the vertebrate stress response. To review the current state of research on stress physiology of free-ranging animals and its application to conservation, we canvassed more than 1000 articles on GC measures in wildlife published since 1969. For 454 studies published since 1990, we assessed the most commonly analysed correlates and disturbances and conducted a meta-analysis on commonly studied species. We noted a prominent divide in the legacies of fish-related analyses and those of higher order vertebrates and the need and opportunity to transfer knowledge between fields. Fish studies most frequently measured physiological indicators, condition, and the relationship between stress and mortality, whereas other vertebrate studies most frequently measured reproduction, condition, and environmental correlates. Correlates that significantly influenced GC levels across all vertebrate groups and are thus important to control for in study design and analyses include density and dispersal of conspecifics, season, reproductive status, and social status. Consistent trends across commonly studied species included positive GC response to capture and handling, reduced GC response related to acclimation, and a lack of correlation between condition and baseline GC levels. Our synthesis within and across diverse taxonomic orders reveals substantial research coverage but a lack of depth in multivariate analyses and a disparity in how correlates are controlled. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of correlates and disturbances that influence GC measures and, as such, has useful applications to assist conservation physiologists in study design, analysis, and interpretation.},

	abstract = {The input of agrochemicals has contributed to alteration of community composition in managed and associated natural systems, including amphibian biodiversity. Pesticides and fertilizers negatively affect many amphibian species and can cause mortality and sublethal effects, such as reduced growth and increased susceptibility to disease. However, the effect of pesticides and fertilizers varies among amphibian species. We used meta-analytic techniques to quantify the lethal and sublethal effects of pesticides and fertilizers on amphibians in an effort to review the published work to date and produce generalized conclusions. We found that pesticides and fertilizers had a negative effect on survival of -0.9027 and growth of -0.0737 across all reported amphibian species. We also observed differences between chemical classes in their impact on amphibians: inorganic fertilizers, organophosphates, chloropyridinyl, phosphonoglycines, carbamates, and triazines negatively affected amphibian survival, while organophosphates and phosphonoglycines negatively affected amphibian growth. Our results suggest that pesticides and fertilizers are an important stressor for amphibians in agriculturally dominated systems. Furthermore, certain chemical classes are more likely to harm amphibians. Best management practices in agroecosystems should incorporate amphibian species-specific response to agrochemicals as well as life stage dependent susceptibility to best conserve amphibian biodiversity in these landscapes.},

We review the animal welfare impacts of the wildlife trade as they were reported in the literature between 2006 and 2011.

Literature focused on mammals and on animals killed on site, for luxury goods or food, and for traditional medicine. Welfare impacts may be underreported, particularly in international, illegal, and wild-caught trade and trade in reptiles. Greater attention should perhaps be paid to the welfare of animals traded alive and in larger numbers (e.g., birds, reptiles, amphibians) and to those-including mammals-potentially subject to greater impacts through live use (e.g., as pets). More evidence-based research is needed. Animal welfare should be integrated with wider issues; collaboration between conservationists and welfarists and the development of health and welfare levers to influence trade offer benefits to both people and wildlife.},

This included 44 seroepidemiologic studies (some examined {\textgreater} 1 pathogen), 12 case reports, 3 outbreak investigations, and 7 self-reported surveys (including 4 related to personal protective equipment use). Of the 44 seroepidemiologic studies, 37 (84\%) identified an increased risk of zoonotic pathogen infection among veterinarians, and 7 (16\%) identified no increased risk or a decreased risk. Surveys also documented that veterinarians often failed to use recommended personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our review indicated that veterinarians had an increased risk of infection with a number of zoonotic pathogens. It also suggested that veterinarians may inadvertently serve as biological sentinels for emerging pathogens and could potentially spread zoonotic pathogens to their families, community members, and the animals for which they provide care. Professional and policy measures should be implemented to reduce the risk that veterinarians will become infected with, or transmit, zoonotic pathogens.},

	abstract = {Parasitism of the gastrointestinal tract of cattle leads to diminished health and productivity of grazing livestock. Anthelmintics are used to decrease parasite loads in cattle for improved weight gain. This critical review and meta-analysis aims to quantify the magnitude of the effect of use of anthelmintic products on production metrics in beef stocker calves. Four databases were searched in March 2013. Eligible studies compared average daily gain (ADG), or weight gain in stocker calves in northern climates of the United States that received anthelmintic treatments compared with placebo or an alternative anthelmintic treatment. Study results were extracted, and where possible, summary effect measures were calculated. Of 512 citations identified by the search, 9 manuscripts with 23 relevant individual studies were selected. Risk of bias was assessed for all studies included in the review and assessed to be unclear for the majority of the studies. There were 23 studies that assessed the magnitude of effect of anthelmintic use on ADG (summary mean difference in ADG=0.05kg (50g), 95\% CI=0.03-0.07kg, p{\textless}0.00001). The magnitude of weight gain associated with anthelmintic use could not be assessed, as measures of precision (standard errors or standard deviations) were not reported in these studies. Overall, the conclusion was made that anthelmintic use is associated with an increased weight gain. However, the approach to reporting employed by authors for this type of study means that many studies could not be included in the meta-analysis and the magnitude of effect not determined.},

Study results were extracted, summary effect measures were calculated, and the quality of the evidence was assessed. From 334 citations identified, 10 were relevant to the review. For heifers, there was limited evidence of moderate quality to assess the impact of vaccination on infection risk (RR, 0.89; P = .16; 95\% CI, 0.76-1.05; 6 randomized and 4 nonrandomized studies; 251 animals) and open risk (RR, 0.80; P = .06; 95\% CI, 0.63-1.01; 6 randomized and 5 nonrandomized studies; 570 animals). The quality of the body of work describing the impact of vaccination on abortion risk was low (summary RR, 0.57; P = .0003; 95\% CI, 0.42-0.78; 3 randomized and 2 nonrandomized studies; 176 animals). The quality of evidence was very low for duration of infection (mean difference, -23.42; P = .003; 95\% CI, -38.36 to -7.85; 2 randomized and 3 nonrandomized studies; 163 animals). Although the summary effect measures suggest a benefit to vaccination, due to publication bias the effect reported here is likely an over estimate of efficacy. For bull-associated outcomes, the evidence base was low or very low quality.},

We have conducted a systematic review of prevalence of subclinical mastitis in dairy cows for the period 1995-2014 using electronic and non-electronic databases. Meta-analysis of 28 studies was done under random effects model using Metaprop package in R software. The pooled estimate of prevalence of subclinical mastitis on cow-basis was obtained using 6344 cows from 25 studies and was found to be 46.35 \% (95 \% CI 39.38; 53.46). Meta-analysis for quarter-wise prevalence of subclinical mastitis was carried out using 18,721 udder quarters of dairy cows from 23 studies, and the pooled estimate of prevalence of subclinical mastitis on quarter-basis was found to be 23.25 \% (95 \% CI 18.15; 29.27). Meta-analysis showed that there is statistically high heterogeneity for the prevalence estimates between published studies. The present study reported that there is high prevalence of subclinical mastitis in dairy cows in India, which might be responsible for low productivity in lactating cows in India over the years and needs to be controlled by adopting scientific, managemental, and therapeutic measures. Dairy farmers can reduce incidence and economic losses due to subclinical mastitis under the guidance of field veterinarians.},

	abstract = {European legislation has defined as process hygiene criteria for the main livestock species (cattle, sheep, goats, horses and pigs) the monitoring of aerobic colony count and Enterobacteriaceae. Detected values above the defined criteria require an improvement in slaughter hygiene and the review of process control. The main source of microbiological contamination of beef carcasses along the slaughterline is of fecal origin, therefore Escherichia coli and Enterobacteriaceae seem to be the most suitable indicators to assess the hygienic status of the slaughter process. Although microbiological criteria addressing indicator bacteria have been in place in industrialized countries for several years, scattered information still exists on factors affecting their counts on beef carcasses along the slaughterline. Therefore, a systematic literature review, covering the period 2000-2012, was conducted to gather information concerning: 1) counts of E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae on beef carcasses linked to different stages of the slaughterline; 2) factors influencing presence/counts of E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae on beef carcasses; and 3) the relationship between indicator bacteria (E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae) counts and visual fecal contamination of beef carcasses. According to the 41 retrieved papers the following conclusions were drawn. A decrease of the indicator bacteria counts was recorded after sequential decontamination treatments, such as pasteurization and hot water washing. Slaughterhouse characteristics influenced bacterial load of beef carcasses, although it was difficult to assess which factors (i.e., slaughterhouse throughput, design of the plant, surveillance system in place) had the greatest effect. Finally, carcasses from fecal contaminated animals had higher bacterial loads than those from clean animals. Therefore, the development of a visual classification system of the level of dirtiness of carcasses and the application of effective treatments on the carcasses classified as dirty along the slaughterline can lead to a contamination level for these carcasses comparable to or lower than that of originally clean ones at the end of the slaughterline.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The meta-analysis was performed to identify animal research defining the effects of low power laser irradiation on biomechanical indicators of bone regeneration and the impact of dosage. METHODS: We searched five electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane Database of Randomised Clinical Trials) for studies in the area of laser and bone healing published from 1966 to October 2008. Included studies had to investigate fracture healing in any animal model, using any type of low power laser irradiation, and use at least one quantitative biomechanical measures of bone strength. There were 880 abstracts related to the laser irradiation and bone issues (healing, surgery and assessment). Five studies met our inclusion criteria and were critically appraised by two raters independently using a structured tool designed for rating the quality of animal research studies. After full text review, two articles were deemed ineligible for meta-analysis because of the type of injury method and biomechanical variables used, leaving three studies for meta-analysis. Maximum bone tolerance force before the point of fracture during the biomechanical test, 4 weeks after bone deficiency was our main biomechanical bone properties for the Meta analysis. RESULTS: Studies indicate that low power laser irradiation can enhance biomechanical properties of bone during fracture healing in animal models. Maximum bone tolerance was statistically improved following low level laser irradiation (average random effect size 0.726, 95\% CI 0.08-1.37, p 0.028). While conclusions are limited by the low number of studies, there is concordance across limited evidence that laser improves the strength of bone tissue during the healing process in animal models.},

Altogether, 41 papers were collected for effect size (theta) calculation and the comparisons were made with entire males (EM) and surgical castrates (SC). The data for reproductive organs and growth performance are numerous enough to draw firm conclusions. In contrast, data for carcass and meat quality are more limited. Results of meta-analysis show efficient immunocastration with the magnitude of the response being by far the largest for reproductive organs (theta = -2.8 to -5.0) and boar taint substances (theta = -2.8 and -0.8 for androstenone and skatole, respectively). However, compared with SC, the immunocastrates exhibit larger bulbourethral glands (theta = 1.3) and slightly higher concentrations of androstenone and skatole (theta = 0.1 and theta = 0.2, respectively). The impact of immunocastration is also remarkable on performance, where the main advantage of the immunocastrates is their boar-like performance until revaccination. In the period following the second vaccination, they eat much more than EM (theta = 2.1), resulting in large effect size for growth rate compared with both EM and SC (theta = 1.1 and theta = 1.4, respectively). Considering the whole fattening period, their feed conversion ratio is higher compared with EM (theta = 0.6) and much lower than that of SC (theta = -1.3), although exhibiting moderately faster growth compared with both (theta = 0.6 and theta = 0.2, respectively). With regard to carcass quality, the immunocastrates take intermediate position between EM and SC. Besides, our analysis suggests no difference in meat quality with SC and some meat quality advantages of immunocastrates over EM because of higher intramuscular fat content (theta = 0.4) and lower shear force (theta = -0.6).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The emergence of the 2009 influenza pandemic virus with a swine origin stressed the importance of improving influenza surveillance in swine populations. The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to describe epidemiological features of swine influenza (SI) across the world and identify factors impacting swine influenza virus surveillance. METHODS: The systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines. Articles published after 1990 containing data on SI on pig and herd-level seroprevalence, isolation and detection rates, and risk factors were included. Meta-regression analyses using seroprevalence and virological rates were performed. RESULTS: A total of 217 articles were included. Low avian influenza (AI) seroprevalence (means pig = 4.1\%; herd = 15\%) was found, showing that AIV do not readily establish themselves in swine while SIV seroprevalence was usually high across continents (influenza A means pig = 32.6-87.8\%; herd = 29.3-100\%). Higher pig density and number of pigs per farm were shown by the meta-regression analyses and/or the risk factor articles to be associated with higher SI seroprevalence. Lower seroprevalence levels were observed for countries with low-to-medium GDP. These results suggest that larger industrial farms could be more at risk of SIV circulation. Sampling swine with influenza-like illness (ILI) was positively associated with higher isolation rates; most studies in Europe, Latin and North America were targeting swine with ILI. CONCLUSIONS: To improve understanding of SI epidemiology, standardization of the design and reporting of SI epidemiological studies is desirable. Performance of SI surveillance systems in low-to-medium GDP countries should be evaluated to rule out technical issues linked to lower observed SIV prevalence. Targeting certain swine age groups, farming systems and swine with ILI may improve the surveillance cost-effectiveness. However, focusing on pigs with ILI may bias virus detection against strains less virulent for swine but which may be important as pandemic threats.},

A systematic review was conducted based on Cochrane guidelines. Peer-reviewed analytic journal articles in English were eligible and were assessed for risk of bias by two reviewers independently. Of 11,149 search results, 13 reports in English-language peer-reviewed journals addressed the association between neutering/age at neutering and mammary tumours. Nine were judged to have a high risk of bias. The remaining four were classified as having a moderate risk of bias. One study found an association between neutering and a reduced risk of mammary tumours. Two studies found no evidence of an association. One reported "some protective effect" of neutering on the risk of mammary tumours, but no numbers were presented. Due to the limited evidence available and the risk of bias in the published results, the evidence that neutering reduces the risk of mammary neoplasia, and the evidence that age at neutering has an effect, are judged to be weak and are not a sound basis for firm recommendations.},

It was postulated that disparity observed between the results of similar trials may have arisen from differences in study design, including the dosage of GnRH used; the number of days after calving at which GnRH was administered; the concurrent use of prostaglandins to induce oestrus; and the enrollment of cows with an abnormal puerperium. The results of 24 trials, extracted from 12 research papers were assessed using meta-analysis. When all trials were considered, treatment with GnRH did not significantly alter the number of days to first oestrus or first service or the relative risk of pregnancy at first service (P {\textgreater} 0.05). While treatment did significantly reduce the number of days open by 2.75 days and the number of services per conception by 0.05 services, the results of these studies were heterogenous (P {\textless} 0.001) and the validity of pooled estimates questionable. The results of the subgroup of studies that enrolled only cows with a normal puerperium were homogenous for all outcomes examined (P {\textgreater} 0.43), although none of the pooled estimates were significant. Sensitivity analyses, performed by excluding the consistently outlying results of one study, improved the homogeneity of all outcomes (P {\textgreater} 0.03) and produced a significant reduction of 4.52 days to first oestrus in treated cows. Pooled estimates derived without the results of the outlying study were considered more valid indicators of the direction and likely magnitude of effect than those derived in the heterogenous overall analyses. The results of this meta-analysis showed that while blanket treatment of dairy cows in the postpartum period may reduce the number of days to first oestrus, subsequent reproductive performance is unaltered. The study also demonstrated a need to concentrate further research on the potential for treatment with GnRH during the postpartum period to improve the reproductive performance of cows with an abnormal puerperium.},

	abstract = {The risk factors associated with canine visceral leishmaniosis (CVL) in Brazil are unclear and controversial. The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to identify the best evidence available in this field and to determine the gaps in existing knowledge. Literature searches were carried out using four databases, the reference lists within articles, and references provided by experts in the field. Theoretical discussions or separate and independent meta-analyses of p-values or of effect sizes were used to pool information about each variable. Thirty-six articles were selected for detailed review, including 31 cross-sectional, two ecological and three cohort studies. The variables showing significant association with CVL were short hair, purebred, peri-domestic restricted (as compared with domestic-restricted dogs), and presence of green areas adjacent to home. The occurrence of CVL was also associated with the presence of domestic fowl in the home environment, with free dogs (as compared with restrained dogs), with male gender and with dogs {\textgreater}1 or 2 years of age, although these associations were not statistically significant. Due to the small number of publications, consistent results could not be obtained concerning the role of other factors. Most studies did not describe the criteria of eligibility and the process of selection of participants in sufficient detail and employed only one diagnostic test as proof of infection. Few studies controlled for confounding variables. No statistical evidence of publication bias was detected, but a great deal of information contained in the primary articles was lost because the results were not adequately described. The results of this review contribute to a better understanding of CVL and should assist in optimizing the development and implementation of control policies. Continuous actions, prioritizing dogs at higher risk and areas with higher abundance of green vegetation, together with policies to promote responsible dog ownership are mandatory. Problems concerning study design and data analysis described in the present study need to be taken into consideration in future studies. These must follow clear procedures to select participants and utilize standardized, valid and reliable diagnostic methods. The development of multivariate models and the use of the STROBE statement for description of the results should also be encouraged. Further research should investigate the patterns identified and prioritize CVL-related factors that have not been fully recognized or elucidated. Finally, ecological and cohort studies of CVL and investigations in other countries of Latin America are urgently required.},

	abstract = {The understanding of the structure of free-roaming dog populations is of extreme importance for the planning and monitoring of populational control strategies and animal welfare. The methods used to estimate the abundance of this group of dogs are more complex than the ones used with domiciled owned dogs. In this systematic review, we analyze the techniques and the results obtained in studies that seek to estimate the size of free-ranging dog populations. Twenty-six studies were reviewed regarding the quality of execution and their capacity to generate valid estimates. Seven of the eight publications that take a simple count of the animal population did not consider the different probabilities of animal detection; only one study used methods based on distances; twelve relied on capture-recapture models for closed populations without considering heterogeneities in capture probabilities; six studies applied their own methods with different potential and limitations. Potential sources of bias in the studies were related to the inadequate description or implementation of animal capturing or viewing procedures and to inadequacies in the identification and registration of dogs. Thus, there was a predominance of estimates with low validity. Abundance and density estimates carried high variability, and all studies identified a greater number of male dogs. We point to enhancements necessary for the implementation of future studies and to potential updates and revisions to the recommendations of the World Health Organization with respect to the estimation of free-ranging dog populations.},

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review. STUDY POPULATION: Peer reviewed literature on canine OA. METHODS: A computer-based bibliographic search was performed on PubMed and CAB Abstracts in August 2013 to find peer reviewed publications relevant to canine OA. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. The outcome measures reported within each publication were recorded and categorized for comparison. Adequately described outcome measures were assessed for uniqueness and evidence of prior validation. RESULTS: Of 3,697 publications identified and screened, 117 were deemed eligible for inclusion. Within eligible publications, outcome measures were used 618 times (median of 4 outcome measures per publication). Outcomes measured were divided into 5 groups containing 65 categories. The most frequently assessed outcomes were lameness assessment with no stated gait/mixed gaits (66 outcomes), radiography (58), and lameness single gait/lateral motion (55). Of 618 outcome measures reported, 491 were assessed for uniqueness and 348 (71\%) were unique to a single publication. Ten outcome measures were reported to have been validated. CONCLUSION: Many outcome measures have been used to assess canine OA. There is no consensus on which are the most useful outcomes or by which method they should be assessed. There is a pressing need for agreement on outcomes reporting in canine OA and for validation of outcome measures used for these assessments. Until consensus is reached, we recommend at least one validated outcome measure be used in every clinical study.},

DESIGN: Literature review and survey of state public health veterinarians and state epidemiologists. PROCEDURE: MEDLINE and agriculture databases were searched from 1966 through 2000. Retrieved references and additional resources provided by the authors were reviewed. A survey was sent to state public health veterinarians and state epidemiologists to determine whether their states had written recommendations or guidelines for controlling zoonotic diseases in animal exhibition venues, whether their states maintained a listing of animal exhibitors in the state, and whether they had any information on recent outbreaks involving animals in exhibitions. RESULTS: 11 published outbreaks were identified. These outbreaks occurred in a variety of settings including petting zoos, farms, and a zoological park. An additional episode involving exposure to a potentially rabid bear required extensive public health resources. A survey of state public health veterinarians identified 16 additional unpublished outbreaks or incidents. Most states did not have written recommendations or guidelines for controlling zoonotic diseases or any means to disseminate educational materials to animal exhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Recent outbreaks of zoonotic diseases associated with contact with animals in exhibition venues highlight concerns for disease transmission to public visitors. Only a handful of states have written guidelines for preventing zoonotic disease transmission in animal exhibition venues, and published recommendations currently available focus on preventing enteric diseases and largely do not address other zoonotic diseases or prevention of bite wounds.},

	abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cultures throughout the world give plants to their dogs in order to improve hunting success. These practices are best developed in lowland Ecuador and Peru. There is no experimental evidence for the efficacy of these practices nor critical reviews that consider possible pharmacological effects on dogs based on the chemistry of the ethnoverterinary plants. AIM: This review has three specific aims: (1) determine what plants the Ecuadorian Shuar and Quichua give to dogs to improve their hunting abilities, (2) determine what plants other cultures give to dogs for the same purpose, and (3) assess the possible pharmacological basis for the use of these plants, particularly the psychoactive ones. METHODS: We gathered Shuar (Province of Morona-Santiago) and Quichua (Napo and Orellano Provinces) data from our previous publications and field notes. All specimens were vouchered and deposited in QCNE with duplicates sent to NY and MO. Data presented from other cultures derived from published studies on ethnoveterinary medicine. Species names were updated, when necessary, and family assignments follow APG III (Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, 2009. An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III. Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 161, 105-121). Chemical data were found using PubMed and SciFinder. RESULTS: The Shuar and Quichua of Ecuador use at least 22 species for ethnoveterinary purposes, including all but one of their principal hallucinogens. Literature surveys identified 43 species used in other cultures to improve hunting ability. No published studies have examined the pharmacological active of these plant species in dogs. We, thus, combined phytochemical data with the ethnobotanical reports of each plant and then classified each species into a likely pharmacological category: depuratives/deodorant, olfactory sensitizer, ophthalmic, or psychoactive. CONCLUSIONS: The use of psychoactive substances to improve a dogs hunting ability seems counterintuitive, yet its prevalence suggests that it is both adaptive and that it has an underlying pharmacological explanation. We hypothesize that hallucinogenic plants alter perception in hunting dogs by diminishing extraneous signals and by enhancing sensory perception (most likely olfaction) that is directly involved in the detection and capture of game. If this is true, plant substances also might enhance the ability of dogs to detect explosives, drugs, human remains, or other targets for which they are valued.},

The strength of the evaluated evidence most strongly supports the ability of the TPLO in the ability to return dogs to normal function. It also provided strong support that functional recovery in the intermediate postoperative time period was superior following TPLO compared with lateral extracapsular suture.

	abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the maintenance energy requirements of adult dogs. Suitable publications were first identified, and then used to generate relationships amongst energy requirements, husbandry, activity level, methodology, sex, neuter status, dog size, and age in healthy adult dogs. Allometric equations for maintenance energy requirements were determined using log-log linear regression. So that the resulting equations could readily be compared with equations reported by the National Research Council, maintenance energy requirements in the current study were determined in kcal/kg0.75 body weight (BW). Ultimately, the data of 70 treatment groups from 29 publications were used, and mean (+/- standard deviation) maintenance energy requirements were 142.8+/-55.3 kcal.kgBW-0.75.day-1. The corresponding allometric equation was 81.5 kcal.kgBW-0.93.day-1 (adjusted R2 = 0.64; 70 treatment groups). Type of husbandry had a significant effect on maintenance energy requirements (P{\textless}0.001): requirements were greatest in racing dogs, followed by working dogs and hunting dogs, whilst the energy requirements of pet dogs and kennel dogs were least. Maintenance energy requirements were less in neutered compared with sexually intact dogs (P{\textless}0.001), but there was no effect of sex. Further, reported activity level tended to effect the maintenance energy requirement of the dog (P = 0.09). This review suggests that estimating maintenance energy requirements based on BW alone may not be accurate, but that predictions that factor in husbandry, neuter status and, possibly, activity level might be superior. Additionally, more information on the nutrient requirements of older dogs, and those at the extremes of body size (i.e. giant and toy breeds) is needed.},

METHODS: This review summarizes the results of six published studies on the effects of brief interactions with dogs and the effects of introducing dogs in families with a child diagnosed with ASD, with an emphasis on social behaviors and language use. Furthermore, the possible mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects observed are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Although the studies described here are encouraging, further research with better designs and using larger samples is needed to strengthen translation of such interventions to the clinic. In addition, potential applications of analyzing child-dog interactions are highlighted to screen for early signs of the disorder.},

OBJECTIVES: This analysis reviews all cases of acute arsenic toxicosis in cattle reported in the literature and describes cases from Purdue University that had a favorable outcome. Clinical presentation of the disease, treatments, and variables associated with survival are described. ANIMALS: One hundred and fifty-six cattle with arsenic toxicosis from 16 outbreaks. METHODS: Meta-analysis. RESULTS: The most common clinical signs were sudden death (68\%), diarrhea (33\%), ataxia (29\%), dehydration (22\%), and respiratory distress (4\%). The most common clinicopathologic abnormalities included azotemia (100\%), hematuria (100\%), increased liver enzyme activity (86\%), and increased hematocrit (60\%). One percent of cattle survived and the survival time for nonsurvivors ranged from 20 hours to 21 days. None of the clinical signs or clinicopathologic findings was associated with survival. Treatment was attempted in 24\% of cases and was not associated with survival (P = .055), but administration of an antidote and administration of fluids were associated with better outcome (P = .036 and P = .009, respectively). In the animals presented to Purdue University, treatment with IV fluids and sodium thiosulfate resulted in decreased blood arsenic concentrations in all animals (P = .009) and a survival rate of 50\%.

	abstract = {Maternal nutrition can have long-term effects on offspring morphology, physiology and behaviours. However, it is unclear whether mothers 'program' offspring behavioural coping strategy (proactive/reactive) according to the predicted nutritional quality of their future environment. We conducted a systematic review on this topic and meta-analytically synthesized relevant experimental data on mice and rats (46 studies). We included data from experiments where dams were subjected to caloric restriction, protein restriction or overfeeding around gestation and subsequently measured offspring activity, exploration, or anxiety. Overall, little evidence existed for effects of maternal nutrition on the three investigated behavioural traits. The high heterogeneity observed in the data set suggests that maternal programming may sometimes occur. However, because offspring had access to a balanced diet before testing, behaviours may have been reprogrammed. Our results may indicate that reprogrammed behaviours could ameliorate negative effects associated with sub-optimal nutrition in early life. Further, our systematic review revealed clear knowledge gaps and fruitful future research avenues.},

	abstract = {This survey examines the extent to which live chimpanzees have been used in monoclonal antibody (mAb) research and the drug approval process. The survey covers 193 scientific articles published during the years 1981-2010, as well as preclinical studies leading to the approval of mAb drugs by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States. The frequency of the articles has decreased by more than two- thirds from their highs in the late 1980's, and the aggregate number of chimpanzees used in these studies has decreased by more than 90\%. The experimental protocols ranged from single or multiple blood draws to extraction of body fluids and tissue samples, and to multiple, repeated organ biopsies. Many studies involved infecting the chimpanzee(s) with pathogenic organisms and immunization and infusion protocols. Addressing the health history and status of the chimpanzees was an exception rather than the rule, and anesthesia and analgesia were mentioned only in a small minority of the surveyed articles. In the past two decades, the FDA has approved 32 mAb drugs, but only three of those drugs could be determined to involve the chimpanzee in the preclinical stage. Two of those three drugs have been withdrawn from the market due to their severe adverse effects in human patients. Available alternatives, together with ethical and economic reasons, suggest that the use of the chimpanzee in this manner may not be necessary or appropriate.},

A systematic search was carried out to review scientific literature on inherited disorders in domestic horse breeds and examine patterns in potentially inherited disorders. A two-part search was conducted: (i) electronic bibliographic databases for published studies; and (ii) existing online databases of inherited disorders in animals. A total of 230 papers were identified, discussing 102 inherited disorders in the horse. Few cases (17) were found in which disorders were reported to have a direct link to a conformational or phenotypic trait. Forty-nine breeds of domestic horse were described as being predisposed to one or more inherited disorders, but such predispositions did not distinguish between genetic or environmental causes. There were few patterns in the number of disorders to which breeds were reportedly predisposed or in the extent to which disorders were researched. The structure and grouping of disorders presented here could assist with standardisation in the terminology used for describing inherited disorders.},

	abstract = {A systematic review of the literature was performed with the objective to evaluate the effects of progesterone supplementation using a single intravaginal insert during timed artificial insemination (AI) programs on fertility in lactating dairy cows. A total of 25 randomized controlled studies including 8,285 supplemented cows and 8,398 untreated controls were included in the meta-analysis. Information regarding the presence of corpus luteum (CL) at the initiation of the synchronization protocol was available for 6,883 supplemented cows and 6,879 untreated controls in 21 experiments. Studies were classified based on service number (first AI vs. resynchronized AI), use of presynchronization (yes vs. no), and insemination of cows in estrus during the synchronization protocol (inseminated in estrus and timed AI vs. timed AI only). Reproductive outcomes of interest were pregnancy per AI (P/AI) measured on d 32 (27 to 42) and 60 (41 to 71) after AI, and pregnancy loss between d 32 and 60 of gestation. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted and treatment effect was summarized into a pooled risk ratio with the Knapp-Hartung modification (RRK+H). The effect of moderator variables was assessed using meta-regression analyses. Progesterone supplementation increased the risk of pregnancy on d 32 [RRK+H = 1.08; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-1.14] and 60 after AI (RRK+H = 1.10; 95\% CI = 1.03-1.17). The benefit of progesterone supplementation was observed mainly in cows lacking a CL at the initiation of the timed AI program (d 60: RRK+H = 1.18; 95\% CI = 1.07-1.30) rather than those with CL (d 60: RRK+H = 1.06; 95\% CI = 0.99-1.12). Progesterone supplementation benefited P/AI in studies in which all cows were inseminated at timed AI (d 60: RRK+H = 1.20; 95\% CI = 1.10-1.29), but not in studies in which cows could be inseminated in estrus during the timed AI program (d 60: RRK+H = 1.04; 95\% CI = 0.92-1.16). Progesterone supplementation tended to reduce the risk of pregnancy loss (RRK+H = 0.84; 95\% CI = 0.67-1.00). Service number and presynchronization did not influence the effect of progesterone supplementation on fertility. In summary, progesterone supplementation using a single intravaginal insert during the timed AI program increased P/AI mostly in cows without CL and reduced the risk of pregnancy loss in lactating dairy cows. Insemination of cows in estrus during the synchronization protocol eliminated the benefit of supplemental progesterone on P/AI.},

PubMed, Scopus and Scholar Google databases were searched in all languages from 1980 to 2012. The studies in the meta-analysis were only selected if they were randomised and controlled experiments using broilers without apparent disease and the results were published in peer-reviewed journals. 2. A total of 48 and 46 studies were included to assess probiotic effects on body weight gain (BWG) and feed efficiency, respectively. Probiotics increased BWG compared to controls (SMD = 0.661, 95\% CI 0.499-0.822) and improved FE (SMD = -0.281, 95\% CI -0.404 to -0.157) in the pooled standardised mean difference random effect model, considering the source of heterogeneity and publication biases. However, there are evidences of publication bias and heterogeneity, so the results of this meta-analysis should be considered with caution. Applying the Duval and Tweedie s trim and fill methods the adjusted value for BWG was 0.0594 (95\% CI -0.122 to 0.242), and the adjusted value for FE did not show any modifications. 3. The meta-analysis showed that application of probiotics via water resulted in greater BGW and FE than administration through the feed. The effect was not related to the use of mono-strain or multi-strain probiotics, although it may depend on the strain used. The number of broilers and the duration of the experiments had an impact on the outcomes. 4. Additional studies should be conducted with the aim to identify the covariates which can explain the differences in the estimated effect sizes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Appendicular osteosarcoma is the most common malignant primary canine bone tumor. When treated by amputation or tumor removal alone, median survival times (MST) do not exceed 5 months, with the majority of dogs suffering from metastatic disease. This period can be extended with adequate local intervention and adjuvant chemotherapy, which has become common practice. Several prognostic factors have been reported in many different studies, e.g. age, breed, weight, sex, neuter status, location of tumor, serum alkaline phosphatase (SALP), bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP), infection, percentage of bone length affected, histological grade or histological subtype of tumor. Most of these factors are, however, only reported as confounding factors in larger studies. Insight in truly significant prognostic factors at time of diagnosis may contribute to tailoring adjuvant therapy for individual dogs suffering from osteosarcoma. The objective of this study was to systematically review the prognostic factors that are described for canine appendicular osteosarcoma and validate their scientific importance. RESULTS: A literature review was performed on selected studies and eligible data were extracted. Meta-analyses were done for two of the three selected possible prognostic factors (SALP and location), looking at both survival time (ST) and disease free interval (DFI). The third factor (age) was studied in a qualitative manner. Both elevated SALP level and the (proximal) humerus as location of the primary tumor are significant negative prognostic factors for both ST and DFI in dogs with appendicular osteosarcoma. Increasing age was associated with shorter ST and DFI, however, was not statistically significant because information of this factor was available in only a limited number of papers. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated SALP and proximal humeral location are significant negative prognosticators for canine osteosarcoma.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Feline herpesvirus 1 is a highly contagious virus that affects many cats. Virus infection presents with flu-like signs and irritation of ocular and nasal regions. While cats can recover from active infections without medical treatment, examination by a veterinarian is recommended. Lysine supplementation appears to be a popular intervention (recommended by {\textgreater} 90 \% of veterinarians in cat hospitals). We investigated the scientific merit of lysine supplementation by systematically reviewing all relevant literature. METHODS: NCBI's PubMed database was used to search for published work on lysine and feline herpesvirus 1, as well as lysine and human herpesvirus 1. Seven studies on lysine and feline herpesvirus 1 (two in vitro studies and 5 studies with cats), and 10 publications on lysine and human herpesvirus 1 (three in vitro studies and 7 clinical trials) were included for qualitative analysis. RESULTS: There is evidence at multiple levels that lysine supplementation is not effective for the prevention or treatment of feline herpesvirus 1 infection in cats. Lysine does not have any antiviral properties, but is believed to act by lowering arginine levels. However, lysine does not antagonize arginine in cats, and evidence that low intracellular arginine concentrations would inhibit viral replication is lacking. Furthermore, lowering arginine levels is highly undesirable since cats cannot synthesize this amino acid themselves. Arginine deficiency will result in hyperammonemia, which may be fatal. In vitro studies with feline herpesvirus 1 showed that lysine has no effect on the replication kinetics of the virus. Finally, and most importantly, several clinical studies with cats have shown that lysine is not effective for the prevention or the treatment of feline herpesvirus 1 infection, and some even reported increased infection frequency and disease severity in cats receiving lysine supplementation. CONCLUSION: We recommend an immediate stop of lysine supplementation because of the complete lack of any scientific evidence for its efficacy.},

The two gases are comparable for most of the parameters. However, sevoflurane allowed a more rapid recovery, a smaller decrease in respiratory rate and caused fewer cardiac arrhythmias. Both gases generally induced a decrease in blood pressure, respiratory rate, and body temperature. They also caused a decrease in heart rate during the anaesthesia, the extent of which appeared to depend on the duration of the intervention and the gas concentration. Changes in respiratory parameters and blood gas values appeared to be related to the ventilation technique used (spontaneous or controlled).},

	abstract = {Phytase, a widely used feed additive in poultry diets, increases P availability and subsequently reduces inorganic-P supplementation and P-excretion. Phytase supplementation effect on P-retention in poultry has been investigated, but the effect sizes were highly variable. The present study's objective was to conduct several meta-analyses to quantitatively summarize the phytase effect on P-retention in broilers and layers. Data from 103 and 26 controlled experiments testing the phytase effect on P-retention were included in 2 separate meta-analyses for broilers and layers, respectively. The mean difference calculated by subtracting the means of P-retention for the control group from the phytase-supplemented group was chosen as an effect size estimate. Between-study variability (heterogeneity) of mean difference was estimated using random-effect models and had a significant effect (P {\textless} 0.01) in both broilers and layers. Therefore, random-effect models were extended to mixed-effect models to explain heterogeneity and obtain final phytase effect size estimates. Available dietary and bird variables were included as fixed effects in the mixed-effect models. The final broiler mixed-effect model included phytase dose and Ca-to-total-P ratio (Ca:tP), explaining 15.6\% of the heterogeneity. Other variables such as breed might further explain between-study variance. Broilers consuming control diets were associated with 48.4\% P-retention. Exogenous phytase supplementation at 1,039 FTU/kg of diet increased P-retention by 8.6 percentage units on average. A unit increase of phytase dose and Ca:tP from their means further increased P-retention. For layers, the final mixed-effect models included dietary Ca, age, and experimental period length. The variables explained 65.9\% of the heterogeneity. Layers receiving exogenous phytase at 371 FTU/kg were associated with a 5.02 percentage unit increase in P-retention. A unit increase in dietary Ca from its mean increased P-retention, whereas an increase in the experiment length and layer's age decreased P-retention. Phytase supplementation had a significant positive effect on P-retention in both broilers and layers, but effect sizes across studies were significantly heterogeneous due to differences in Ca contents, experiment length, bird age, and phytase dose.},

Twenty studies demonstrated a beneficial response to Vitamin E whilst 21 found no benefit and 3 reported an increase in the incidence of RFM in treated cows. The odds ratios (OR) of the available studies exhibited significant heterogeneity, so multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to enable the identification of factors associated with the response to Vitamin E supplementation. Our multivariable analysis included parity and Vitamin E supplementation (control/treated) in the model, because all other factors were co-linear. Results indicated that Vitamin E supplementation led to a reduction in the incidence of RFM. A second multivariable analysis was undertaken on a subset of the data including only supplemented cows to determine the influence of supplementation factors on the risk of RFM. All factors were co-linear with each other, therefore, only type of Vitamin E supplementation was included in this analysis. The regression model demonstrated that administration of the synthetic Vitamin E alpha-tocopheryl acetate was associated with a lower risk of RFM than treatment with natural Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) (P=0.047, OR=0.49), whereas the difference between the synthetic Vitamin E alpha-tocopherol acetate and natural Vitamin E just failed to attain statistical significance (P=0.059, OR=0.53). Overall the analyses indicate that Vitamin E supplementation during the dry period is associated with a reduced risk of RFM, and that the synthetic forms of Vitamin E are more effective than the natural compound.},

Companion animals are able to transmit a range of zoonotic diseases to their owners including giardiasis, but the size of this risk is not well known. The aim of this study was to analyse giardiasis prevalence rates in dogs and cats worldwide using a systematic search approach. Meta-analysis enabled to describe associations between Giardia prevalence and various confounding factors. Pooled prevalence rates were 15.2\% (95\% CI 13.8-16.7\%) for dogs and 12\% (95\% CI 9.2-15.3\%) for cats. However, there was very high heterogeneity between studies. Meta-regression showed that the diagnostic method used had a major impact on reported prevalence with studies using ELISA, IFA and PCR reporting prevalence rates between 2.6 and 3.7 times greater than studies using microscopy. Conditional negative binomial regression found that symptomatic animals had higher prevalence rates ratios (PRR) than asymptomatic animals 1.61 (95\% CI 1.33-1.94) in dogs and 1.94 (95\% CI 1.47-2.56) in cats. Giardia was much more prevalent in young animals. For cats {\textgreater}6 months, PRR=0.47 (0.42-0.53) and in dogs of the same age group PRR=0.36 (0.32-0.41). Additionally, dogs kept as pets were less likely to be positive (PRR=0.56 (0.41-0.77)) but any difference in cats was not significant. Faecal excretion of Giardia is common in dogs and slightly less so in cats. However, the exact rates depend on the diagnostic method used, the age and origin of the animal. What risk such endemic colonisation poses to human health is still unclear as it will depend not only on prevalence rates but also on what assemblages are excreted and how people interact with their pets.},

DESIGN: Standardized, systematic evaluation of the literature, categorization of relevant articles according to level of evidence and quality, and development of consensus on conclusions for application of the concepts to clinical practice. Relevant questions were answered on a worksheet template and reviewed by the Reassessment Campaign on Veterinary Resuscitation (RECOVER) monitoring domain members, by the RECOVER committee and opened for comments by veterinary professionals for 3 months. SETTING: Academia, referral practice, and general practice. RESULTS: Eighteen worksheets evaluated monitoring practices relevant for diagnosing cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA), monitoring CPR efforts, identifying return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and post-ROSC monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Although veterinary clinical trials are lacking, experimental literature using canine models and human clinical trials provided relevant data. The major conclusions from this analysis of the literature highlight the utility of end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO(2)) monitoring to identify ROSC and possibly to evaluate quality of CPR. In addition, recommendations for ECG analysis during CPR were addressed. Unless the patient is instrumented at the time of CPA, other monitoring devices (eg, Doppler flow probe) are likely not useful for diagnosis of CPA, and the possibility of pulseless electrical activity makes ECG inappropriate as a sole diagnostic tool. Optimal monitoring of the intra- and postcardiac arrest patient remains to be determined in clinical veterinary medicine, and further evaluation of the prognostic and prescriptive utility of EtCO(2) monitoring will provide material for future studies in veterinary CPR.},

CONCLUSIONS: Nontraditional assays identified included thrombelastography (TEG)-PlateletMapping (PM), functional fibrinogen assessment, and rapid-TEG (r-TEG). Direct veterinary evidence was found for only the ADP-activated PM, which appears to generate valid data in dogs but not cats or horses. Arachidonic acid activated PM shows high variability and requires further assessment and validation in veterinary species. Functional fibrinogen assays may be performed in veterinary species but may require modification due to species differences in response to abciximab. While tissue factor (TF)-activated TEG has been well described in the veterinary literature, the specific r-TEG assay has not been assessed, but presumably would be effective for generating TEG tracings and values for maximum amplitude and angle in shorter periods of time than some traditional assays.},

Most studies reported significant benefits of animal-assisted interventions in the school setting. Despite this, studies vary greatly in methods and design, in intervention types, measures, and sample sizes, and in the length of time exposed to an animal. Furthermore, a worrying lack of reference to risk assessment and animal welfare must be highlighted. Taken together, the results of this review show promising findings and emerging evidence suggestive of potential benefits related to animals in school settings. The review also indicates the need for a larger and more robust evidence base driven by thorough and strict protocols.

Yet there is a lack of scientifically based evidence to confirm this animal health status. This paper reviews what has been published on diseases of domestic animals in the Pacific Islands region with a particular focus on data from the last 20 years (1992-2012). Relevant published papers were identified by a computerized literature search of two electronic databases (PubMed and Web of Knowledge). The latest reports on the animal health situation submitted by the PICTs to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) were accessed on the World Animal Health Information Database (WAHID) interface and included in this review. Additionally, paper searches of resources were undertaken at the library of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) in Fiji to retrieve any relevant grey literature for this review. The study eligibility criteria included qualitative or quantitative information on any disease (bacterial, viral, parasitic and other health disorders) affecting domestic terrestrial animals (mammals, reptiles, birds and bees) in any of the 22 PICTs members of the SPC. A total of 158 eligible references were retrieved of which only 77 (48.7\%) were published since 1992 and analysed in more details. One hundred and one diseases and pathogens were reported on for bee, bird, carabao, cat, cattle, crocodile, deer, dog, donkey, goat, horse, pig, pigeon, poultry and sheep in the Oceania region and in 17 PICTs in particular. The paper gives information about known animal diseases, their reported prevalence and diseases not reported within the Pacific Islands region. The study found retrieved literature on animal diseases in PICTs was scarce and no longer up to date. There is a need to improve the published knowledge on the current animal disease status in the region.},

	volume = {18},
	doi = {10.1186/s12888-018-1613-2},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing recognition of the therapeutic function pets can play in relation to mental health. However, there has been no systematic review of the evidence related to the comprehensive role of companion animals and how pets might contribute to the work associated with managing a long-term mental health condition. The aim of this study was to explore the extent, nature and quality of the evidence implicating the role and utility of pet ownership for people living with a mental health condition. METHODS: A systematic search for studies exploring the role of companion animals in the management of mental health conditions was undertaken by searching 9 databases and undertaking a scoping review of grey literature from the earliest record until March 2017. To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to be published in English and report on primary data related to the relationship between domestic animal ownership and the management of diagnosable mental health conditions. Synthesis of qualitative and quantitative data was undertaken in parallel using a narrative synthesis informed by an illness work theoretical framework. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies were included in the review. Quantitative evidence relating to the benefits of pet ownership was mixed with included studies demonstrating positive, negative and neutral impacts of pet ownership. Qualitative studies illuminated the intensiveness of connectivity people with companion animals reported, and the multi-faceted ways in which pets contributed to the work associated with managing a mental health condition, particularly in times of crisis. The negative aspects of pet ownership were also highlighted, including the practical and emotional burden of pet ownership and the psychological impact that losing a pet has. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that pets provide benefits to those with mental health conditions. Further research is required to test the nature and extent of this relationship, incorporating outcomes that cover the range of roles and types of support pets confer in relation to mental health and the means by which these can be incorporated into the mainstay of support for people experiencing a mental health problem.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This systematic review aimed to present and critically appraise the available information on the efficacy of platelet rich plasma (PRP) in equine and human orthopedic therapeutics and to verify the influence of study design and methodology on the assumption of PRP's efficacy. We searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, Bireme and Google Scholar without restrictions until July 2013. Randomized trials, human cohort clinical studies or case series with a control group on the use of PRP in tendons, ligaments or articular lesions were included. Equine clinical studies on the same topics were included independently of their design. Experimental studies relevant to the clarification of PRP's effects and mechanisms of action in tissues of interest, conducted in any animal species, were selected. RESULTS: This review included 123 studies. PRP's beneficial effects were observed in 46.7\% of the clinical studies, while the absence of positive effects was observed in 43.3\%. Among experimental studies, 73\% yielded positive results, and 7.9\% yielded negative results. The most frequent flaws in the clinical trials' designs were the lack of a true placebo group, poor product characterization, insufficient blinding, small sampling, short follow-up periods, and adoption of poor outcome measures. The methods employed for PRP preparation and administration and the selected outcome measures varied greatly. Poor study design was a common feature of equine clinical trials. From studies in which PRP had beneficial effects, 67.8\% had an overall high risk of bias. From the studies in which PRP failed to exhibit beneficial effects, 67.8\% had an overall low risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Most experimental studies revealed positive effects of PRP. Although the majority of equine clinical studies yielded positive results, the human clinical trials' results failed to corroborate these findings. In both species, beneficial results were more frequently observed in studies with a high risk of bias. The use of PRP in musculoskeletal lesions, although safe and promising, has still not shown strong evidence in clinical scenarios.},

OBJECTIVE: Determine efficacy of chilling on reducing Salmonella prevalence or concentration on broiler carcasses using systematic review-meta-analysis, and explore sources of heterogeneity among studies investigating various processing interventions through meta-regression. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search included electronic search in six databases, manual search of reference lists of topic-related articles, and consultation with five topic experts to assure that all relevant intervention research was identified. STUDY INCLUSION: Primary intervention research, published in English, encompassing control, challenge, cohort, or before-and-after study designs investigating the efficacy of any chilling or other processing interventions on Salmonella prevalence or concentration in broiler chicken carcasses. RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT AND DATA EXTRACTION: Data pertaining to study methodology and reported results, chilling or other processing intervention parameters, populations sampled and outcomes measured were assessed for methodological soundness and extracted by two independent reviewers using pretested checklists. RESULTS: Random-effects meta-analyses of immersion chilling with chlorine (n=9 trials), acetic acid (n=16) and potable water (n=13) trended towards reductions in the odds or log(10)CFU/ml of Salmonella. Significant heterogeneity (P-value{\textless}/=0.1 and I(2){\textgreater}25\%) precluded the reporting of pooled summary effect estimates. Meta-regression of all processing interventions indicated that serotype, disinfectant type and treatment time and pH were significantly associated with studies reporting reductions in concentration while study design, population sampled, study setting, publication date, intervention and disinfectant type, and treatment pH were significantly associated with studies reporting reductions in prevalence. Methodological and reporting flaws were consistently observed in relevant intervention research as well as a lack of studies conducted under commercial conditions and using Salmonella concentration outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Chilling may be effective at reducing Salmonella concentration and prevalence, but significant heterogeneity precluded reporting of pooled summary effect estimates for many chilling interventions. Investigations into potential sources of heterogeneity among all processing interventions found that the use of other chemical disinfectants, such as organic acids and surfactants might result in larger reductions in Salmonella contamination than more commonly utilized oxidizing agents like chlorine.},

	abstract = {Context: Broiler chicken carcass spray and dip treatments are just two of many different interventions investigated to address the need to reduce \_Salmonella\_ prevalence and concentration on broiler chicken carcasses during processing. However the results of published research are inconsistent and sometimes contradictory creating a need to formally evaluate, synthesize and summarize available research to avoid recommending ineffective treatments and identify key knowledge gaps for future work. Objective: Evaluate intervention research that measured the efficacy of various spray and dip treatments, applied on broiler chicken carcasses during primary processing, as \_Salmonella\_ prevalence or concentration on broiler carcasses, using systematic review-meta-analysis (SR-MA). Data sources: A comprehensive electronic search was implemented in six databases and verified through a manual search of topic-related reference lists, related reviews or book chapters, and through consultations with selected topic experts. Study inclusion: Control and challenge trials, cohort and before-and-after intervention research published in English that investigated the efficacy of any spray or dip treatments, applied to broiler chicken carcasses or carcass parts during processing, on \_Salmonella\_ prevalence or concentration measured at the same level under laboratory, pilot plant and commercial conditions. Risk of bias assessment and data extraction: Relevant research was evaluated for methodological soundness and completeness of reporting. The main characteristics of each study included in the review were extracted. Data analysis: Random-effects MA of trisodium phosphate and lactic acid dip treatments (\_n\_=12 and \_n\_=32 trials with prevalence outcomes, respectively) resulted in homogeneous (\_p\_-value=0.469; \_I\_²=0.0\% and \_p\_-value=0.284; \_I\_²=11.4\%, respectively) summary effect estimates (OR=1.16; 95\% CI: 0.59-2.26 and OR=0.05; 95\% CI: 0.03-0.10, respectively). Visual evaluation of MA forest plots indicated overall reduction trends for six spray treatments reporting concentration outcomes: trisodium phosphate (\_n\_=48 trials), acidic electrolyzed oxidizing water (\_n\_=2), cetylpyridinium chloride (\_n\_=43), lactic acid (\_n\_=24), sodium bisulfate (\_n\_=11) and potable water (\_n\_=36). Moderate to considerable heterogeneity (\_p\_-value {\textless}=0.1 and \_I\_²{\textgreater}25\%) was observed for these treatments. Methodological soundness of included studies was poor and a lack of studies conducted under commercial conditions was observed. Conclusions: Existing research on the efficacy of broiler carcass dips or sprays on \_Salmonella\_ prevalence or concentration is limited and heterogeneous, precluding the full benefits of robust meta-analyses. Larger randomized controlled trials conducted under commercial conditions are needed.},

	abstract = {Bacterial endocarditis (BE) is the most common valvular disease in cattle but diagnosis in the living animal remains a challenge for clinicians. The objective of the study was to report evidence-based veterinary medicine data concerning the clinical presentation and results of ancillary tests of necropsy-confirmed cases of bovine BE. A systematic review and subsequent meta-analysis was performed using Medline and CAB abstracts of every article on bovine BE published in English, Japanese, German and French. The clinical criteria that were specifically assessed for diagnosis of BE were: tachycardia, heart murmur, signs of congestive heart failure, presence of fever, evidence of lameness/polyarthritis, one or more positive blood cultures and positive echocardiograms for BE. A total of 34 studies (460 cases of BE) satisfied the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. The sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) were obtained using a random-effect meta-analysis for studies reporting five or more cases. The Se (95\% CI) were 86.9\% (39.1-98.6\%) for positive haemoculture, 84.3\% (60.4-95.0\%) for echocardiography, 79.7\% (70.1-86.8\%) for the presence of tachycardia, 60.3\% (51.8-68.3\%) for the presence of a murmur, 45.7\% (32.5-59.5\%) for the presence of fever, 43.5\% (25.6-63.3\%) for the presence of lameness/polyarthritis, and 37.3\% (21.6-57.0\%) for the presence of clinical signs of heart failure. The Sp (95\% CI) was 95.3\% (93.3-96.8\%) for lameness, 72.6\% (45.8-89.2\%) for the presence of a murmur, 67.0\% (55.5-76.7\%) for the presence of fever, and 27.1\% (14.3-45.2\%) for the presence of tachycardia. This meta-analysis confirmed that the diagnosis of BE is a difficult process. Echocardiography seems to be a sensitive diagnostic tool despite the absence of any consensus on the ultrasonographic definition of the disease. However, from these results, it was impossible to determine whether multiple positive findings or clinical tests increase the sensitivity for the diagnosis of bovine BE.},

	abstract = {The aim of this work was to explore the comparative epidemiology of influenza viruses, H5N1 and H7N9, in both bird and human populations. Specifically, the article examines similarities and differences between the two viruses in their genetic characteristics, distribution patterns in human and bird populations and postulated mechanisms of global spread. In summary, H5N1 is pathogenic in birds, while H7N9 is not. Yet both have caused sporadic human cases, without evidence of sustained, human-to-human spread. The number of H7N9 human cases in the first year following its emergence far exceeded that of H5N1 over the same time frame. Despite the higher incidence of H7N9, the spatial distribution of H5N1 within a comparable time frame is considerably greater than that of H7N9, both within China and globally. The pattern of spread of H5N1 in humans and birds around the world is consistent with spread through wild bird migration and poultry trade activities. In contrast, human cases of H7N9 and isolations of H7N9 in birds and the environment have largely occurred in a number of contiguous provinces in south-eastern China. Although rates of contact with birds appear to be similar in H5N1 and H7N9 cases, there is a predominance of incidental contact reported for H7N9 as opposed to close, high-risk contact for H5N1. Despite the high number of human cases of H7N9 and the assumed transmission being from birds, the corresponding level of H7N9 virus in birds in surveillance studies has been low, particularly in poultry farms. H7N9 viruses are also diversifying at a much greater rate than H5N1 viruses. Analyses of certain H7N9 strains demonstrate similarities with engineered transmissible H5N1 viruses which make it more adaptable to the human respiratory tract. These differences in the human and bird epidemiology of H5N1 and H7N9 raise unanswered questions as to how H7N9 has spread, which should be investigated further.},

	abstract = {Despite a much higher rate of human influenza A (H7N9) infection compared to influenza A (H5N1), and the assumption that birds are the source of human infection, detection rates of H7N9 in birds are lower than those of H5N1. This raises a question about the role of birds in the spread and transmission of H7N9 to humans. We conducted a meta-analysis of overall prevalence of H5N1 and H7N9 in different bird populations (domestic poultry, wild birds) and different environments (live bird markets, commercial poultry farms, wild habitats). The electronic database, Scopus, was searched for published papers, and Google was searched for country surveillance reports. A random effect meta-analysis model was used to produce pooled estimates of the prevalence of H5N1 and H7N9 for various subcategories. A random effects logistic regression model was used to compare prevalence rates between H5N1 and H7N9. Both viruses have low prevalence across all bird populations. Significant differences in prevalence rates were observed in domestic birds, farm settings, for pathogen and antibody testing, and during routine surveillance. Random effects logistic regression analyses show that among domestic birds, the prevalence of H5N1 is 47.48 (95\% CI: 17.15-133.13, P {\textless} 0.001) times higher than H7N9. In routine surveillance (where surveillance was not conducted in response to human infections or bird outbreaks), the prevalence of H5N1 is still higher than H7N9 with an OR of 43.02 (95\% CI: 16.60-111.53, P {\textless} 0.001). H7N9 in humans has occurred at a rate approximately four times higher than H5N1, and for both infections, birds are postulated to be the source. Much lower rates of H7N9 in birds compared to H5N1 raise doubts about birds as the sole source of high rates of human H7N9 infection. Other sources of transmission of H7N9 need to be considered and explored.},

	abstract = {Administration of antimicrobials to livestock increases the risk of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in commensal bacteria. Antimicrobials in pig production are usually administered per pen via feed which implies treatment of sick alongside with healthy animals. The objective of this systematic literature review was to investigate the effect of orally administered antimicrobials on AMR in Escherichia coli of swine. Studies published in peer reviewed journals were retrieved from the international online databases ISI Web of Knowledge, PubMed, Scopus and the national electronic literature data base of Deutsches Institut fur Medizinische Dokumentation und Information. The studies were assessed using the eligibility criteria English or German language, access to full paper version, defined treatment and control group (initial value or non-treatment) as well as administration and resistance testing of the same antimicrobial class. In the qualitative synthesis, only studies were included presenting the summary measures odds ratio or prevalence of resistance, the category of the applied antimicrobial and the dosage. An effect of the antimicrobial on AMR in E. coli was evaluated as an "increase", "no effect" or "decrease" if the odds or alternatively the prevalence ratio were {\textgreater}1.0, 1.0 or {\textless}1.0, respectively. Eleven studies, describing 36 different trials, fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were finally assessed. An increase of AMR in E. coli was found in 10 out of 11 trials comparing AMR after with AMR prior to oral treatment and in 22 of the 25 trials comparing orally treated with untreated groups. Effects expressed as odds or prevalence ratios were highest for the use of aminoglycosides, quinolones and tetracycline. There was no clear association between the reported dosage and AMR towards tetracycline. Information on antimicrobial substance and dosage was missing in 4 and 5 of the 11 finally selected studies. The 36 identified trials were inhomogenous in usage and provision of information on sample size. Oral administration of antimicrobials increases the risk of AMR in E. coli from swine. There is however a lack of studies on the impact of dosage and longitudinal effects of treatment. The published studies have a number of issues concerning their scientific quality. More high quality research is needed to better address and quantifiy the effect of orally administered antimicrobials on AMR in swine.},

We systematically reviewed the scientific and gray literature and used the United Nations Environment Programme – World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) trade database to establish temporal and geographical trade patterns of live exotic birds, mammals, and reptiles and to describe trends in research, taxonomic representation, and level of threat and legal protection of species traded. Birds were the most species-rich and abundant class reported in trade; reptiles were second most abundant but unusually the most studied in this context; and mammals were least abundant in trade. Mammalian and reptilian species traded as pets were more likely to be threatened than expected by random. There have been a substantial number of Appendix I listed captive-bred mammals and birds and wild-caught birds and reptiles reported in trade to CITES. We identified the Middle East's emerging role as a driver of demand for exotic pets of all taxa alongside the well-established and increasing role of South America and Southeast Asia in the market. Europe, North America, and the Middle East featured most heavily in trade reports to CITES, whereas trade involving South America and Southeast Asia were given most emphasis in the literature. For effective monitoring of and appropriate response to the international exotic pet trade, it is imperative that the reliability and detail of CITES trade reports improve and that scientific research be directed toward those taxa and locations that are most vulnerable.},

This trend has resulted in an increase in the number of livestock moving from south-east Asian countries into China. Foot and mouth disease is becoming one of the most important trans-boundary animal diseases affecting the livelihood of livestock owners in China. To contribute to the long term goal to control and eradicate FMD from China, the Chinese government has adopted a series of control measures which includes compulsory routine vaccination against the disease. In this paper, the surveillance results of the routine vaccination programme were systemically reviewed. The results from 28 published papers were combined and analysed through a meta-analysis approach. The results of the meta-analysis indicated that the vaccination programme has been very successful in China with more than 70\% of animals protected against serotypes Asia-1 and O.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted to assess production responses before 90 d in milk (DIM) when bovine somatotropin (bST) administration was initiated between 5 and 35 DIM. The database was developed from 13 studies of multiparous cows that were published between 1985 and 2006 and from an unpublished study that complied with the study selection criteria. The database included results from 842 cows and provided 50 treatment means for the effect of bST on 3.5\% fat-corrected milk (FCM) in early lactation. Effects of bST were investigated using mixed model procedures that included fixed (intercept and slope) and random (intercept and slope) effects for independent variables. Yields of milk (38.6 +/- 1.3 kg/d) and FCM (37.6 +/- 1.6 kg/d) by control cows before 90 DIM were increased by 2.6 +/- 0.8 and 3.2 +/- 0.6 kg/d by bST administration. Fat content in milk from bST-treated cows was 0.31 +/- 0.10 percentage units greater than that from control cows (3.46 +/- 0.13\%) but milk protein content (2.95 +/- 0.03\%) was not altered by bST. Milk fat (1.39 +/- 0.10 kg/d) and protein (1.15 +/- 0.04 kg/d) yields by controls were increased 0.16 +/- 0.03 and 0.07 +/- 0.03 kg/d by bST, respectively. Dry matter intake and body weight loss were not altered by bST before 90 DIM, but duration of negative energy balance was prolonged and overall energy balance during this interval reduced when cows were treated with bST. Results are consistent with the premise that bST-treated cows partition nutrients and energy toward milk synthesis for a longer duration and thus likely need a longer interval to replenish their body reserves than cows not treated with bST. Production responses to bST were not altered when cows consumed typical early-lactation diets supplemented with fat except that supplemental fat tended to decrease the magnitude of the effect of bST on milk fat content and decreased the effect of bST on fat and protein yield. Yield of FCM increased curvilinearly with the amount of bST administered. Results indicate that initiation of bST administration to cows before 35 DIM increased FCM yield but the response was at the low end of that typically observed when bST administration is initiated in wk 9 of lactation.},

Selenium supplementation has been used to enhance Se status and milk Se concentration, but results conflict. Milk Se concentration appears to be a useful indicator of animal and herd Se status, and reflects the responsiveness to supplementation. A systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out to summarize all available scientific evidence for the effect of oral Se supplementation on milk Se concentration in cattle. The literature search was based on electronic and nonelectronic databases. Fixed- and random-effects models of meta-analysis were used, and a meta-regression was carried out to evaluate heterogeneity among studies. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed on 42 studies published between 1977 and 2007. Oral Se supplementation resulted in an average increase in milk Se content of 0.16 (95\% confidence interval: 0.117, 0.207) micromol/L, with a significant heterogeneity among studies. Weak publication bias was evident, but it did not change the average effect. The continent where the study was performed, Se source, Se dose, and the interaction between source and dose explained 71\% of the between-study variance. On average, American cows supplemented with Se yeast (e.g., 6 mg/h per day) had greater milk Se concentrations (approximately 0.37 micromol/L) 75 d after the beginning of supplementation when compared with those supplemented with inorganic forms of Se. This information provides a basis for tailoring daily animal requirements and for enhancing the Se intake of consumers of dairy products.},

A systematic review of the literature was performed in Lilacs, Medline and Pubmed databases, and the articles published from 2000 to 2013 were selected. A significant number of studies involving different samples was observed. Wide variations on the MRSA prevalence were found, and also on the methodologies used for the analyses. The MLST strain ST398 is commonly detected in pigs, and it was the most isolated bacterium from samples analyzed in different studies. ST8 and ST5 strains, belonging to human biovar, have also been frequently isolated, suggesting that food handlers have been a source for meat contamination with MRSA.},

	abstract = {Databases are systematic tools to archive and manage information related to marine mammal stranding and mortality events. Stranding response networks, governmental authorities and non-governmental organizations have established regional or national stranding networks and have developed unique standard stranding response and necropsy protocols to document and track stranded marine mammal demographics, signalment and health data. The objectives of this study were to (1) describe and review the current status of marine mammal stranding and mortality databases worldwide, including the year established, types of database and their goals; and (2) summarize the geographic range included in the database, the number of cases recorded, accessibility, filter and display methods. Peer-reviewed literature was searched, focussing on published databases of live and dead marine mammal strandings and mortality and information released from stranding response organizations (i.e. online updates, journal articles and annual stranding reports). Databases that were not published in the primary literature or recognized by government agencies were excluded. Based on these criteria, 10 marine mammal stranding and mortality databases were identified, and strandings and necropsy data found in these databases were evaluated. We discuss the results, limitations and future prospects of database development. Future prospects include the development and application of virtopsy, a new necropsy investigation tool. A centralized web-accessed database of all available postmortem multimedia from stranded marine mammals may eventually support marine conservation and policy decisions, which will allow the use of marine animals as sentinels of ecosystem health, working towards a 'One Ocean-One Health' ideal.},

A total of 11 studies from 9 papers, with information on the milk production and composition data from a total number of 238 cows were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis software in Stata. Estimated size of effect of biotin was calculated for dry matter intake (DMI), milk production, and composition. Heterogeneity was not significant for all of the parameters (the highest I(2)=12\%). Therefore, fixed effects models were used for analysis. With the addition of biotin to lactating dairy cattle, DMI and milk production increased by 0.87 and 1.66 kg/d. No significant effect on percentage of milk fat and milk protein was observed. Additionally, Begg's test indicated no evidence of substantial publication bias for all variables. The influence analysis shows that the removal of any study did not change the direction or significance of the point estimates. It can be concluded that the use of biotin supplements increases DMI and milk yield in lactating dairy cows.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bibliographic data can be used to map the research quality and productivity of a discipline. We hypothesized that bibliographic data would identify geographic differences in research capacity, species specialization, and interdisciplinary relationships within the veterinary profession that corresponded with demographic and economic indices. RESULTS: Using the SCImago portal, we retrieved veterinary journal, article, and citation data in the Scopus database by year (1996-2011), region, country, and publication in species-specific journals (food animal, small animal, equine, miscellaneous), as designated by Scopus. In 2011, Scopus indexed 165 journals in the veterinary subject area, an increase from 111 in 1996. As a percentage of veterinary research output between 1996 and 2010, Western Europe and North America (US and Canada) together accounted for 60.9\% of articles and 73.0\% of citations. The number of veterinary articles increased from 8815 in 1996 to 19,077 in 2010 (net increase 66.6\%). During this time, publications increased by 21.0\% in Asia, 17.2\% in Western Europe, and 17.0\% in Latin America, led by Brazil, China, India, and Turkey. The United States had the highest number of articles in species-specific journals. As a percentage of regional output, the proportion of articles in small animal and equine journals was highest in North America and the proportion of articles in food animal journals was highest in Africa. Based on principal component analysis, total articles were highly correlated with gross domestic product (based on World Bank data). The proportion of articles in small animal and equine journals was associated with gross national income, research and development, and \% urban population, as opposed to the proportion of food animal articles, agricultural output, and \% rural population. Co-citations linked veterinary medicine with medicine in the United States, with basic sciences in Eastern Europe and the Far East, and with agriculture in most other regions and countries. CONCLUSIONS: Bibliographic data reflect the demographic changes affecting veterinary medicine worldwide and provide insight into current and changing global research capacity, specialization, and interdisciplinary affiliations. A more detailed analysis of species-specific trends is warranted and could contribute to a better understanding of educational and workforce needs in veterinary medicine.},

Publication bias was assessed by the Egger test, rank test, contour-enhanced funnel plots, and the Vevea and Hedges weight-function model. Results consistently indicated the presence of publication bias, highlighting an overestimation of WTP for farm animal welfare.

Only in the last three decades has the number of clinical trials increased considerably. This literature is generally not well perceived, which may be partly a consequence of the diffuse and somewhat inaccessible nature of some of the relevant research publications. The Veterinary Clinical Research Database for Homeopathy (VetCR) was launched in 2006 to provide information on existing clinical research in veterinary homeopathy and to facilitate the preparation of systematic reviews. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present report is to provide an overview of this first database on clinical research in veterinary homeopathy, with a special focus on its content of placebo controlled clinical trials and summarising what is known about placebo effects in animals. RESULTS: In April 2012, the VetCR database contained 302 data records. Among these, 203 controlled trials were identified: 146 randomised and 57 non-randomised. In 97 of those 203 trials, the homeopathic medical intervention was compared to placebo. COMMENT: A program of formal systematic reviews of peer-reviewed randomised controlled trials in veterinary homeopathy is now underway; detailed findings from the program's data extraction and appraisal approach, including the assessment of trial quality (risk of bias), will be reported in due course.},

	abstract = {Globally, large populations of companion animals are relinquished each year. The purpose of this scoping review was to identify all published research investigating companion-animal relinquishment to map out and evaluate research gaps, needs, and opportunities. A comprehensive search strategy was implemented in 4 online databases, identified citations were screened, and relevant articles were procured and characterized. From 6,848 unique citations identified, 192 were confirmed relevant, including 115 primary-research articles and 77 reviews and commentaries. The majority of these articles originated from the United States (131; 68.2\%); 74 (38.5\%) of them have been published since 2006. Among the primary-research articles, 84 (73.0\%) investigated reasons for companion-animal relinquishment. The most commonly studied reasons were aggressive companion-animal behaviors (49; 58.3\%); moving, rental, or housing issues (45; 53.6\%); and caretaker personal issues (42; 50.0\%). Only 17 primary-research articles investigated interventions to prevent companion-animal relinquishment. The quantity of research into reasons for relinquishment highlights an opportunity for future knowledge-synthesis activities in this area, including systematic review and meta-analysis. In comparison, the limited research into interventions identifies a priority for new research.},

From 1794 growth studies involving the feeding of these six test ingredients to salmonid fish, 45 studies were selected for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The relationship between SGR and the dietary inclusion level of plant-based feed ingredients was calculated using Cohen's d (CD), which measures differences between control and experimental means. The results of these meta-analyses showed an increase in the dietary inclusion of SBM, SPC, CM and CPC (not PM or PPC) leads to a significant reduction in SGR. Weighted regressions of inclusion level for each test ingredient on effect size showed significant, negative linear relationships between SGR and dietary inclusions of SBM, SPC, CM and CPC. For PM and PPC, there was no significant relationship between SGR and inclusion rate. The results suggest that the effect of plant ingredients on growth performance of salmonids depends on the specific ingredients and their inclusion levels. The higher effect sizes observed when ingredients are fed at lower inclusion levels and lack of significant impact of feeding mixed diets suggest that feeding low levels of several ingredients might be beneficial.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Poultry represents an important sector in animal production, with backyard flocks representing a huge majority, especially in the developing countries. In these countries, villagers raise poultry to meet household food demands and as additional sources of incomes. Backyard production methods imply low biosecurity measures and high risk of infectious diseases, such as Newcastle disease or zoonosis such as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI).We reviewed literature on biosecurity practices for prevention of infectious diseases, and published recommendations for backyard poultry and assessed evidence of their impact and feasibility, particularly in developing countries. Documents were sourced from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) website, and from Pubmed and Google databases. RESULTS: A total of 62 peer-reviewed and non-referred documents were found, most of which were published recently (after 2004) and focused on HPAI/H5N1-related biosecurity measures (64\%). Recommendations addressed measures for flock management, feed and water management, poultry trade and stock change, poultry health management and the risk to humans. Only one general guideline was found for backyard poultry-related biosecurity; the other documents were drawn up for specific developing settings and only engaged their authors (e.g. consultants). These national guidelines written by consultants generated recommendations regarding measures derived from the highest standards of commercial poultry production. Although biosecurity principles of isolation and containment are described in most documents, only a few documents were found on the impact of measures in family poultry settings and none gave any evidence of their feasibility and effectiveness for backyard poultry. CONCLUSIONS: Given the persistent threat posed by HPAI/H5N1 to humans in developing countries, our findings highlight the importance of encouraging applied research toward identifying sustained and adapted biosecurity measures for smallholder poultry flocks in low-income countries.},

	abstract = {Systematic review of published cases and a hospital-based case-control study were completed to evaluate breed as a risk factor for atresia coli in cattle. Systematic review of 37 published studies indicated that atresia coli has been diagnosed in 10 cattle breeds and 12 countries, with the marked preponderance of cases occurring in Holstein-Friesian calves (485/514 cases, 94\%). Epidemiologic analysis based on 28,373 cattle {\textless} 2 mo of age admitted to North American veterinary schools between 1964 and 1993 identified 291 cases of atresia coli in 13 breeds, with the marked preponderance of cases occurring in Holstein-Friesian calves (228/291, 78\%). Holstein-Friesian cattle were at significantly greater risk for the condition than all other dairy cattle breeds (crude odds ratio 4.55, P {\textless} 0.0001) and all other cattle breeds (crude odds ratio 7.12, P {\textless} 0.0001), whereas there was no difference in the odds ratio between dairy cattle (not Holstein-Friesian) and beef cattle (crude odds ratio 1.68, P = 0.11). Atresia coli probably occurs secondary to vascular insufficiency of the developing colon. Holstein-Friesian cattle may be genetically predisposed to atresia coli, possibly because their developing colon grows at a faster rate and/or to a greater extent than that in other cattle breeds. Early or vigorous palpation per rectum of the amniotic vesicle appears to increase the risk of atresia coli in a genetically predisposed fetus, probably through palpation-induced damage to the developing colonic vasculature.},

A meta-analysis involving 1006 pigs reported in 24 publications was carried out to assess the effects of dietary linseed on alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) content in muscle and adipose tissue. Data showed positive effects of n-3 PUFA on muscle fatty acid composition: ALA+137\%, EPA+188\%, DPA+51\% and DHA+12\%. Same results were observed in adipose tissue: ALA+297\%, EPA+149\%, DPA+88\% and DHA+18\%. A positive correlation between dietary treatment and ALA and EPA content in muscle (P{\textless}0.001) and adipose tissue (P=0.036) was observed. A significant association between DPA (P=0.04) and DHA (P=0.011) and live weight in muscle was observed. Feeding linseed to pig improves the nutritional pork quality, raising the n-3 PUFA content in muscle and adipose tissue.},

Poisoning may result from misuse by pet owners, off-label use of medicines or, more frequently, accidental ingestion of drugs that are improperly stored. This review focuses on classes of drugs intended for human use that are most commonly involved in the poisoning of small animals and provides an overview of poisoning episodes reported in the literature. To perform this review a comprehensive search of public databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar) using key search terms was conducted. Additionally, relevant textbooks and reference lists of articles pertaining to the topic were reviewed to locate additional related articles. Most published information on small animal poisoning by drugs intended for human use was from animal and human poison control centres or from single case reports. The dog was the species most frequently poisoned. The major drugs involved included analgesics (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), antihistamines (H1-antihistamines), cardiovascular drugs (calcium channel blockers), central nervous system drugs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, baclofen, benzodiazepines and zolpidem), gastrointestinal drugs (loperamide), nutritional supplements (vitamin D and iron salts) and respiratory drugs (beta2-adrenergic receptor agonists).},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Zoonotic disease (ZD) pose a serious threat to human health in low-income countries. In these countries the human burden of disease is often underestimated due to insufficient monitoring because of insufficient funding. Quantification of the impact of zoonoses helps in prioritizing healthcare needs. Kyrgyzstan is a poor, mountainous country with 48\% of the population employed in agriculture and one third of the population living below the poverty line. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have assessed the burden of zoonoses in Kyrgyzstan by conducting a systematic review. We have used the collected data to estimate the burden of ZDs and addressed the underestimation in officially reported disease incidence. The estimated incidences of the ZDs were used to calculate incidence-based Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). This standardized health gap measure enhances comparability between injuries and diseases. The combined burden for alveolar echinococcosis, cystic echinococcosis, brucellosis, campylobacteriosis, congenital toxoplasmosis, non-typhoidal salmonellosis and rabies in Kyrgyzstan in 2013 was 35,209 DALYs [95\% Uncertainty interval (UI):13,413-83,777]; 576 deaths [95\% UI: 279-1,168] were attributed to these infections. We estimate a combined median incidence of ZDs of 141,583 cases [95\% UI: 33,912-250,924] in 2013. The highest burden was caused by non-typhoidal Salmonella and Echinococcus multilocularis, respectively 14,792 DALYs [95\% UI: 3,966-41,532] and 11,915 DALYs [95\% UI: 4,705-27,114] per year. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The health impact of zoonoses in Kyrgyzstan is substantial, comparable to that of HIV. Community-based surveillance studies and hospital-based registration of all occurrences of zoonoses would increase the accuracy of the estimates.},

	abstract = {The aquatic environment is increasingly bombarded by a wide variety of noise pollutants whose range and intensity are increasing with each passing decade. Yet, little is known about how aquatic noise affects marine communities. To determine the implications that changes to the soundscape may have on fishes, a meta-analysis was conducted focusing on the ramifications of noise on fish behavior and physiology. Our meta-analysis identified 42 studies that produced 2,354 data points, which in turn indicated that anthropogenic noise negatively affects fish behavior and physiology. The most predominate responses occurred within foraging ability, predation risk, and reproductive success. Additionally, anthropogenic noise was shown to increase the hearing thresholds and cortisol levels of numerous species while tones, biological, and environmental noise were most likely to affect complex movements and swimming abilities. These findings suggest that the majority of fish species are sensitive to changes in the aquatic soundscape, and depending on the noise source, species responses may have extreme and negative fitness consequences. As such, this global synthesis should serve as a warning of the potentially dire consequences facing marine ecosystems if alterations to aquatic soundscapes continue on their current trajectory.},

Studies on the social habits of elephants also deal with the skills and the "intelligence" and brain size of these species. Yet most of the descriptions and conclusions reported in comparative studies rely on second-hand data derived from investigations performed several decades before, often dating as far back as the XIX century.

Research studies directed toward developing vaccines against ticks are emerging. One way to evaluate those vaccines is to calculate the percentage of efficacy. The aim of this study was to analyze scientific publications archived in PubMed that used this method of assessment and discuss the main factors that may affect its calculation. Thus, 25 articles addressing this subject were selected. The percentage of efficacy was usually calculated in one of two ways, with one considering the reduced fertility of eggs and the other not. The latter method may underestimate the vaccine efficacy, and the most complete formula for calculating the efficacy reflects how much the vaccine actually affects the infestation. In our view, the use of the complete formula for calculating the percentage of efficacy is broader and more representative of the vaccine effect on the tick population.},

Given the well-documented efficacy of PCV2 vaccines, information about the comparative efficacy of available vaccines is more relevant to producers and veterinarians than comparison to non-vaccination. The objective of this study was to provide comparative estimates of changes in average daily gain effect associated with the use of the commercially available PCV2 vaccines.

Trials of licensed PCV2 vaccines administered according to manufacturers' specifications to intensively raised piglets with a known herd porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) status were considered relevant to the meta-analysis.

Results indicate a situation of particular interest to Public Health. Regarding dairy production workers, the invisibility of risks associated with handling pesticides for veterinary use, increases their exposure and is related to several health problems, especially for women. This same invisibility leads to a neglect of the prohibition period between pesticide use and consumption of other products. Part of the problem may be associated with the non-classification of pesticides for veterinary use as 'pesticides' (they are classified as veterinary products), which highlights the importance and the urgency of discussion of the theme.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human rabies remains a significant problem in many developing countries, where canine rabies is the most common means of transmission. Although vaccination of dogs has been shown to be the most effective method of prevention in humans, dog vaccination is often lacking. METHODS: This systematic review examined dog rabies vaccination coverage achieved following mass vaccination campaigns and dog ecology/management factors relevant to rabies control in the developing world. We searched a variety of electronic databases for published articles pertaining to dog rabies vaccination or dog ecology where data were collected utilizing a household cluster survey. We reviewed studies published between January 1, 1980 and present and identified 29 articles for inclusion. RESULTS: We found the majority of vaccination campaigns were able to achieve the WHO recommended vaccination coverage of {\textgreater}/= 70\% and calculated weighted mean post-campaign vaccination coverage of 76.5\% in urban areas and 73.7\% in rural areas. However, we found an absence of studies related to dog vaccination/dog ecology from countries with the greatest burden of rabies such as India, China, and Pakistan. In addition, the majority of dogs in the developing world are very young and short-lived, reducing the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns. CONCLUSIONS: Future studies on canine ecology should be undertaken in countries with high endemic canine rabies. New methods for improving the longevity of dogs and reducing high dog population turnover need to be investigated. Programs which encourage good dog management and promote responsible pet ownership are essential to eliminating canine and human rabies.},

Publications (n = 1,600) that included the words "dairy," "cows," and at least one disease of interest were located with online search engines. In total, 51 papers were selected for comprehensive review by pairs of the authors. Only 61\% (n = 31) of the 51 reviewed papers provided a definition or citation for the disease or diagnostic methods studied, and only 49\% (n = 25) of the papers provided the data or a citation to support the test cut point used for diagnosing disease. Furthermore, a large proportion of the papers did not provide sufficient detail to allow critical assessment of the quality of design or reporting. Of 11 described diagnostic methods, only one complete methodology, i.e., vaginoscopy, was assessed for both within- and between-operator repeatability (kappa = 0.55-0.60 and 0.44, respectively). In the absence of a gold standard, comparisons between different tests have been undertaken. Agreement between the various diagnostic methods is at a low level. These discrepancies may indicate that these diagnostic methods assess different aspects of reproductive health and underline the importance of tying diagnostic criteria to objective measures of reproductive performance. Those studies that used a reproductive outcome to select cut points and tests have the greatest clinical utility. This approach has demonstrated, for example, that presence of (muco)purulent discharge in the vagina and an increased proportion of leukocytes in cytological preparations following uterine lavage or cytobrush sampling are associated with poorer reproductive outcomes. The lack of validated, consistent definitions and outcome variables makes comparisons of the different tests difficult. The quality of design and reporting in future publications could be improved by using checklists as a guideline. Further high-quality research based on published standards to improve study design and reporting should improve cow-side diagnostic tests. Specifically, more data on intra- and interobserver agreement are needed to evaluate test variability. Also, more studies are necessary to determine optimal cut points and time postpartum of examination.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically examine the evidence on activating agents and test protocols for the thrombelastography (TEG) and rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM) viscoelastic point-of-care instruments and to identify knowledge gaps. DESIGN: Ten questions were considered, the primary question addressed the use of activating agents and secondary questions addressed assay temperature, length of analysis, pipetting, sample volume, reproducibility, and quality controls. Standardized, systematic evaluation of the literature was performed. Relevant articles were categorized according to level of evidence (LOE). Consensus was developed regarding conclusions for application of concepts to clinical practice. SETTING: Academic and referral veterinary medical centers. RESULTS: PubMed and CAB abstracts were searched. Twenty papers were initially identified concerning the primary question; 16 were in support of the questions (LOE 2 Good, LOE 3 Good, LOE 5 Good, LOE 6 Good, LOE 5 Fair, LOE 6 Fair); and 4 were neutral (LOE 3 Good, LOE 6 Good, LOE Fair, LOE 5 Fair). Additional papers were evaluated post hoc during manuscript preparation. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there is a body of evidence from veterinary and human medicine that strongly suggests that TEG or ROTEM assays using citrated samples that employ an activator have significantly lower inherent variability than those that use recalcification alone. There is also strong evidence in dogs, cats, and humans that the results obtained using different activators are not directly comparable. There is no evidence to suggest that any one activating agent is superior to another for all patient populations, or drug monitoring indications. As such, use of more than one assay for complete thromboelastographic evaluation of a patient's coagulation system may be warranted. Standardization of the concentrations of activators would be beneficial.},

	abstract = {Dogs have different susceptibility degrees to leishmaniasis; however, genetic research on this theme is scarce, manly on visceral form. The aims of this systematic review were to describe and discuss the existing scientific findings on genetic susceptibility to canine leishmaniasis, as well as to show the gaps of the existing knowledge. Twelve articles were selected, including breed immunological studies, genome wide associations or other gene polymorphism or gene sequencing studies, and transcription approaches. As main results of literature, there was a suggestion of genetic clinical resistance background for Ibizan Hound dogs, and alleles associated with protection or susceptibility to visceral leishmaniasis in Boxer dogs. Genetic markers can explain phenotypic variance in both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and in cellular immune responses, including antigen presentation. Many gene segments are involved in canine visceral leishmaniasis phenotype, with Natural Resistance Associated Macrophage Protein 1 (NRAMP1) as the most studied. This was related to both protection and susceptibility. In comparison with murine and human genetic approaches, lack of knowledge in dogs is notorious, with many possibilities for new studies, revealing a wide field to be assessed on canine leishmaniasis susceptibility research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonotic infection worldwide, possibly due to climate change and demographic shifts. It is regarded as endemic in Sub-Saharan Africa; however, for most countries scarce epidemiological data, if any, exist. The primary objectives were to describe the prevalence of leptospirosis in countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, and to develop options for prevention and control in the future. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to determine the prevalence of leptospirosis in Sub-Saharan Africa; the PRISMA guidelines were followed. Medline/PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, BIOSIS Previews, the African Index Medicus, AJOL, and Google Scholar were searched. RESULTS: Information about the prevalence and incidence of leptospirosis in humans is available, but remains scarce for many countries. Data are unavailable or outdated for many countries, particularly those in Central Africa. Most data are available from animals, probably due to the economic losses caused by leptospirosis in livestock. In humans, leptospirosis is an important cause of febrile illness in Sub-Saharan Africa. It concerns numerous serogroups, harboured by many different animal carriers. DISCUSSION: A wide variety of data was identified. Prevalence rates vary throughout the continent and more research, especially in humans, is needed to reliably gauge the extent of the problem. Preventive measures need to be reconsidered to control outbreaks in the future.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper was to perform a critical review of the literature as it pertains to the current status of antimicrobial resistance in pathogens associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in beef cattle and to provide a concise yet informative narrative on the most relevant publications available. As such, the scientific literature contained in PubMed, AGRICOLA, and CAB were searched in February of 2014 for articles related to susceptibility testing of Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni from cases of BRD. Titles and abstracts were read and 105 articles that were relevant to the subject of BRD antibiotic resistance were attained for further review. After the application of exclusion criterion (publications must have originated from North America, be in English, adhere to standards set forth by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, and be concerning antimicrobial resistance in BRD in beef cattle), 16 articles remained and are the focus of this publication. Due to the disparate data from the few studies that investigate susceptibility testing of BRD pathogens, a quantitative assessment or meta-analysis was not performed on the studies presented in this review. However, considering diagnostic lab data, there appears to be a clear trend of a decrease in susceptibility of the three major BRD pathogens to the antimicrobials used commonly for treatment and control of BRD. Studies performing sensitivity testing on healthy cattle report much lower resistance, but it remains unclear if this is because of a true lack of resistance mechanisms, or if the isolates do contain quiescent genes for resistance that are only phenotypically expressed following the administration of an antimicrobial for either treatment or control of BRD. Future research to address this question of genotype and phenotypic expression before and after antimicrobial administration will further advance our knowledge in this area.},

	abstract = {Gold bead implantation/gold acupuncture is becoming increasingly used in veterinary medicine as a method of pain treatment in cases of osteoarthritic diseases. Part one of the overview dealing with the use of gold implants as a treatment of canine hip joint dysplasia (cHD) introduced the method of implanting gold in tissue and publications which investigated the subsequent effects of implantation. This article focuses on publications concerning the clinical effectiveness of gold implantation within the scope of pain therapy in cHD. Due to the study design, a classification using evidence-based levels (EbL) was carried out. Three double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised studies (EbL II) were considered together with three retrospective studies on own patients (EbL IV) and five case studies (EbL IV). While the case and retrospective studies reported impressive therapeutic success in treating cHD-incurred pain with gold implantation, a pain-reducing effect through gold implantation was only demonstrated in one of the three double-blind studies. The two remaining EbL II studies found no differences between the placebo-group and the group of dogs treated with gold implantation. In one of these two studies, kinematic and kinetic gait analyses were used for objective evaluation of the effects of the treatment. Thus, the only study that carried out an objective evaluation of the therapeutic result of gold implantation came to the conclusion that the method is ineffective. For a concluding assessment of gold implantation in the case of cHD, gait analysis studies investigating the effects of gold implantation in comparison to a standard treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are currently lacking.},

	abstract = {Gold-bead implantation as a method of pain treatment in dogs suffering from osteoarthritic disease is receiving increasing attention in veterinary medicine. For the present article, publications from veterinary books and journals were collected and evaluated, together with related articles in human medicine. After providing an overview of the historical use of gold and gold compounds, the technique of implanting this noble metal is introduced. The reasons for establishing the terms gold acupuncture and gold (bead) implantation are described, considering the question whether and what kind of methodological differences exist behind these terms. Next, previous publications concerning the effects of gold implantation in tissue are summarised. In 2002 it was proven that gold ions are released from the surface of gold implants by a process termed dissolucytosis. Subsequent publications further investigated details about the interaction between gold ions and tissue as well as the distribution pattern of bio-released ions. Gold compounds were previously used for chrysotherapy in human medicine until medication with fewer side effects became established. The anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulatory properties of gold compounds were used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Current research aims to ascertain whether the anti-inflammatory and immuno-modulating effects of gold compounds are imitated by gold ions released from gold implants at a local level. In conclusion, the present review summarises important findings about the effects of gold implanted in tissue. However, further research is necessary to estimate the limitations and benefits of this auromedication.},

	abstract = {Salmonella contamination of laying hen flocks and shell eggs is associated with various management and environmental factors. Foodborne outbreaks of human salmonellosis have been traced back to consumption of Salmonella-contaminated shell eggs. In the present study, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify and provide an evidence-based overview of potential risk factors of Salmonella contamination of laying hens, layer premises, and shell eggs. This systematic literature search was conducted using AGRICOLA, CAB Abstracts, and PubMed databases. Observational studies that identified risk factors for Salmonella contamination of layer flocks and shell eggs were selected, and best evidence was synthesized to summarize the results. Altogether, 13 cross-sectional studies and four longitudinal studies published in English were included in the review. Evidence scores were assigned based on the study design and quality of the study to grade the evidence level. The strength of association of a risk factor was determined according to the odds ratios. In this systematic review, the presence of previous Salmonella infection, absence of cleaning and disinfection, presence of rodents, induced molting, larger flock size ({\textgreater}30,000 hens), multiage management, cage housing systems, in-line egg processing, rearing pullets on the floor, pests with access to feed prior to movement to the feed trough, visitors allowed in the layer houses, and trucks near farms and air inlets were identified as the risk factors associated with Salmonella contamination of laying hen premises, whereas high level of manure contamination, middle and late phase of production, high degree of egg-handling equipment contamination, flock size of {\textgreater}30,000, and egg production rate of {\textgreater}96\% were identified as the risk factors associated with Salmonella contamination of shell eggs. These risk factors demonstrated strong to moderate evidence of association with Salmonella contamination of laying hens and shell eggs. Eggshells testing positive for Salmonella were 59 times higher when fecal samples were positive and nine times higher when floor dust samples were positive. Risk factors associated with Salmonella Enteritidis infection in laying hens were flock size, housing system, and farms with hens of different ages. As a summary, this systematic review demonstrated that Salmonella contamination of laying hen flocks and shell eggs in layer production systems is multifactorial. This study provides a knowledge base for the implementation of targeted intervention strategies to control Salmonella contamination of laying hen flocks and shell eggs.},

A search of online databases and selected conference proceedings was conducted to identify relevant studies. The review process followed relevance screening, methodological quality assessment, and data extraction. Although multiple outcomes were frequently reported, only outcomes describing culture of Salmonella were extracted. Five clinical trials and 23 challenge studies were considered likely relevant to the review as they described vaccination to reduce Salmonella in swine. Five clinical trials reported vaccination was associated with reduced isolation of Salmonella in market weight pigs, however, information required to assess the internal validity of the study was often not described in the manuscripts. All challenge studies assessed vaccine efficacy in pigs aged {\textless}15 weeks reducing the relevance of results to the review which focused on market weight pigs. Only five of the 23 challenge studies reported the majority of information necessary to evaluate the quality of vaccine studies. Given large variability in population type, sample size, type of vaccine, dose and dosing regimens, and type of outcomes observed, pooled data analysis was not possible, and therefore, a qualitative synthesis of the studies was conducted. Available evidence suggests that vaccination is associated with reduced Salmonella prevalence in swine at or near harvest; however, this conclusion is based on studies with design and reporting deficiencies that could potentially indicate biases with the outcome.},

	doi = {10.1002/ece3.3287},
	abstract = {Livestock grazing affects over 60\% of the world's agricultural lands and can influence rangeland ecosystem services and the quantity and quality of wildlife habitat, resulting in changes in biodiversity. Concomitantly, livestock grazing has the potential to be detrimental to some wildlife species while benefiting other rangeland organisms. Many imperiled grouse species require rangeland landscapes that exhibit diverse vegetation structure and composition to complete their life cycle. However, because of declining populations and reduced distributions, grouse are increasingly becoming a worldwide conservation concern. Grouse, as a suite of upland gamebirds, are often considered an umbrella species for other wildlife and thus used as indicators of rangeland health. With a projected increase in demand for livestock products, better information will be required to mitigate the anthropogenic effects of livestock grazing on rangeland biodiversity. To address this need, we completed a data-driven and systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature to determine the current knowledge of the effects of livestock grazing on grouse populations (i.e., chick production and population indices) worldwide. Our meta-analysis revealed an overall negative effect of livestock grazing on grouse populations. Perhaps more importantly, we identified an information void regarding the effects of livestock grazing on the majority of grouse species. Additionally, the reported indirect effects of livestock grazing on grouse species were inconclusive and more reflective of differences in the experimental design of the available studies. Future studies designed to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of livestock grazing on wildlife should document (i) livestock type, (ii) timing and frequency of grazing, (iii) duration, and (iv) stocking rate. Much of this information was lacking in the available published studies we reviewed, but is essential when making comparisons between different livestock grazing management practices and their potential impacts on rangeland biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), due to infection with serotype O virus, occurred in wild boar and within eleven outbreaks in domestic livestock in the south-east of Bulgaria, Thrace region, in 2011. Hence, the issue of the potential for the spread and maintenance of FMD virus (FMDV) infection in a population of wild ungulates became important. This assessment focused on the spread and maintenance of FMDV infection within a hypothetical wild boar and deer population in an environment, which is characterized by a climate transitional between Mediterranean and continental and variable wildlife population densities. The assessment was based on three aspects: (i) a systematic review of the literature focusing on experimental infection studies to identify the parameters describing the duration of FMDV infection in deer and wild boar, as well as observational studies assessing the occurrence of FMDV infection in wild deer and wild boar populations, (ii) prevalence survey data of wild boar and deer in Bulgaria and Turkey and (iii) an epidemiological model, simulating the host-to-host spread of FMDV infections. It is concluded, based on all three aspects, that the wildlife population in Thrace, and so wildlife populations in similar ecological settings, are probably not able to maintain FMD in the long term in the absence of FMDV infection in the domestic host population. However, limited spread of FMDV infection in time and space in the wildlife populations can occur. If there is a continued cross-over of FMDV between domestic and wildlife populations or a higher population density, virus circulation may be prolonged.},

	abstract = {The minerals Cu, Mo, and S are essential for metabolic functions related to cattle health and performance. The interaction between Cu, Mo, and S can determine the utilization of each mineral, in particular Cu, by ruminants. A meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effects of dietary Cu, Mo, and S and their interactions on plasma and liver Cu, ADG, and G:F in growing-finishing cattle. Data were collated from 12 published studies. The model with the best fit to data indicated plasma Cu was positively affected by dietary Cu (P {\textless} 0.01) and negatively affected by both dietary Mo (P {\textless} 0.01) and S (P {\textless} 0.01). Another model also indicated that plasma Cu concentration is positively related to Cu:Mo ratio in the diet (P {\textless} 0.01). Dietary Cu had a positive effect on liver Cu (P {\textless} 0.01), whereas Mo showed a negative effect (P {\textless} 0.05), and no effect of dietary S on liver Cu was observed (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Average daily gain was negatively affected by dietary Mo (P {\textless} 0.05) and S (P {\textless} 0.01) and positively affected by Cu:Mo ratio (P {\textless} 0.01), likely because an increased Cu:Mo ratio minimizes the antagonistic effect of Mo on Cu. The feed conversion ratio was negatively affected by Mo (P {\textless} 0.05) and S (P {\textless} 0.01), whereas effects of the Cu:Mo ratio and dietary Cu were not significant (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The interaction between S and Mo affected (P {\textless} 0.01) G:F, which was likely related to a positive response with the proper balance between these minerals. In conclusion, dietary Cu, Mo, and S and the Cu:Mo ratio caused changes in plasma Cu. Only dietary Mo and S led to a negative response in the performance of growing-finishing cattle, whereas the diet Cu:Mo ratio has a linear and quadratic effect on ADG. Nutritionists and producers need to consider with caution the supplementation of growing-finishing cattle diets with Mo and S because of their potentially adverse effects on animal performance. An appropriate Cu:Mo ratio is desirable to minimize the effects of an impaired supply of Mo on Cu metabolism and ADG.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: IgY antibodies are serum immunoglobulin in birds, reptiles and amphibians, and are transferred from serum to egg yolk to confer passive immunity to their embryos and offspring. Currently, the oral passive immunization using chicken IgY has been focused as an alternative to antibiotics for the treatment and control of diarrhea in animals and humans. This systematic review was focused to determine the effect of IgY in controlling and preventing diarrhea in domesticated animals including Piglets, Mice, Poultry and Calves. METHODS AND RESULTS: Previous research reports focused on treatment effect of Chicken IgY against diarrhea were retrieved from different electronic data bases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPRINGER-LINK, WILEY, AGRICOLA, MEDWELL Journals, Scientific Publish, Chinese articles from Core periodicals in 2012). A total of 61 studies in 4 different animal classes met the inclusion criteria. Data on study characteristics and outcome measures were extracted. The pooled relative risk (RR) of 49 studies of different animals [Piglets – 22; Mice – 14; Poultry – 7 and Calves – 6] in meta-analyses revealed that, IgY significantly reduced the risk of diarrhea in treatment group when compare to the placebo. However, the 95\% confidence intervals of the majority of studies in animal class piglets and calves embrace RR of one. The same results were obtained in sub group analyses (treatment regiment – prophylactic or therapeutic; pathogen type – bacterial or viral). Perhaps, this inconsistency in the effect of IgY at the individual study level and overall effect measures could be influenced by the methodological heterogeneity. CONCLUSION: The present systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis demonstrated the beneficial effect of IgY. This supports the opinion that IgY is useful for prophylaxis and treatment. However, more intensive studies using the gold standard animal experiments with the focus to use IgY alone or in combination with other alternative strategies are indispensable.},

Papers selected for analysis had to provide SCC values associated with the natural infection in quarters by different bacteria. Sampling for measurement of SCC and determination of the infection had to be done on the same day. Only papers published in English or in French after 1971 were considered. Twenty-one papers fulfilled the selection criteria. The animals sampled, the measurement techniques for SCC and the bacteriological identification, as well as the definition of the infection, all differed widely among the selected studies. The meta-analysis method was used to estimate both the mean SCC (arithmetic and geometric) value and the average increase on SCC of each type of infection. The geometric mean SCC in bacteriologically negative quarters was 68 000 c/mL. In case of IMI, the retained SCC was 357 000, 857 000, 547 000, 1 024 000, 1 151 000, 138 000 and 105 000 c/mL in quarters infected by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, coliforms, staphylococci other than S. aureus and Corynebacterium bovis, respectively. The variation factors that could influence these SCC values and the bacteriological results are discussed.},

	abstract = {Field studies evaluating the effects of multiple concurrent preharvest interventions for Escherichia coli O157 are logistically and economically challenging; however, modeling techniques may provide useful information on these effects while also identifying crucial information gaps that can guide future research. We constructed a risk assessment model with data obtained from a systematic search of scientific literature. Parameter distributions were incorporated into a stochastic Monte Carlo modeling framework to examine the impacts of different combinations of preharvest and harvest interventions for E. coli O157 on the risk of beef carcass contamination. We estimated the risk of E. coli O157 carcass contamination conditional on preharvest fecal prevalence estimates, inclusion of feed additive(s) in the diet, vaccination for E. coli O157, transport and lairage effects, hide intervention(s), and carcass intervention(s). Prevalence parameters for E. coli O157 were assumed to encompass potential effects of concentration; therefore, concentration effects were not specifically evaluated in this study. Sensitivity analyses revealed that fecal prevalence, fecal-to-hide transfer, hide-to-carcass transfer, and carcass intervention efficacy significantly affected the risk of carcass contamination (correlation coefficients of 0.37, 0.56, 0.58, and -0.29, respectively). The results indicated that combinations of preharvest interventions may be particularly important for supplementing harvest interventions during periods of higher variability in fecal shedding prevalence (i.e., summer). Further assessments of the relationships among fecal prevalence and concentration, hide contamination, and subsequent carcass contamination are needed to further define risks and intervention impacts for E. coli O157 contamination of beef.},

Recombinant bovine somatotropin was found to increase the risk of clinical mastitis by approximately 25\% during the treatment period but there was insufficient data to draw firm conclusions about the effects of the drug on the prevalence of subclinical intra-mammary infections. Use of rBST increased the risk of a cow failing to conceive by approximately 40\%. For cows which did conceive, there was no effect on services per conception and only a small increase in average days open (5 days). Use of the drug had no effect on gestation length, but the information about a possible effect on the risk of twinning was equivocal. Cows treated with rBST had an estimated 55\% increase in the risk of developing clinical signs of lameness. Few studies reported data on culling, but based on those that did, there appeared to be an increase risk of culling evident in multiparous cows. Use of the drug in 1 lactation period appeared to reduce the risk of metabolic diseases (particularly ketosis) in the early period of the subsequent lactation.},

	abstract = {REASONS FOR PERFORMING THE STUDY: An analysis of the factors leading to equine disease events was used to support the development of international recommendations for mitigating the risk of disease dissemination through sport horse movements (high health, high performance -"HHP" horses). OBJECTIVES: A systematic review was undertaken to identify the factors resulting in equine disease events following international movement of horses to draw lessons in support of the development of international recommendations for the safe movements of a specific subpopulation of horses: the HHP sport horses. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The review covered disease events that occurred from 1995 to 2014, identified from the databases of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and international surveillance reports. RESULTS: Overall, 54 disease events were identified, of which 7 were contained in post-arrival quarantine and the others resulted in the introduction of pathogens into importing countries. For 81\% of the introductions, the OIE recommendations applicable to the diseases involved had not been complied with. Subclinical infections are a challenge for international trade: 88\% of the regulated movements that resulted in introductions involved infected horses that showed no clinical signs at the time of import. Biosecurity and management practices in resident equine populations were identified as important mitigating factors in preventing disease spread to the local horse population. CONCLUSIONS: The global increase in international horse movements, if not appropriately regulated and supervised by competent Veterinary Authorities and respective equine industry partners, could potentially lead to increased global spread of infectious equine diseases. Appropriate mitigation measures and compliance with OIE import recommendations for specific diseases can significantly reduce this risk. The recommendations proposed under the HHP approach take into account the mitigation measures identified by this review as important factors in preventing pathogen introduction and spread.

For these programs to be efficient, knowledge of the risk factors involved in transmission is essential. OBJECTIVES: Systematically review the scientific literature concerning risk factors associated with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) transmission to dairy calves. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: An electronic search was done in PubMed and CAB to retrieve references relevant to answer at least 1 of the 5 questions concerning neonatal environment, colostrum, milk, housing of calves, and contact of calves with adult cow feces as risk factors in MAP transmission. A 1st screening was done using titles only, then abstracts, and finally full-length articles were reviewed for relevance. From the articles selected, risk factors and presence of a significant association between these risk factors and MAP transmission were recorded. RESULTS: Twenty-three articles from 11 different countries and published in 12 different journals were reviewed. The most common study design was cross-sectional (n = 16). The case definition and diagnostic tests used were very variable among studies, but serum ELISA was used in most studies (n = 14). The study unit was the herd in 18 studies. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The contact of calves with adult cow feces is the most important risk factor in MAP transmission. The 5 categories of risk factors are linked to one another.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews recent progress in the development of syndromic surveillance systems for veterinary medicine. Peer-reviewed and grey literature were searched in order to identify surveillance systems that explicitly address outbreak detection based on systematic monitoring of animal population data, in any phase of implementation. The review found that developments in veterinary syndromic surveillance are focused not only on animal health, but also on the use of animals as sentinels for public health, representing a further step towards One Medicine. The main sources of information are clinical data from practitioners and laboratory data, but a number of other sources are being explored. Due to limitations inherent in the way data on animal health is collected, the development of veterinary syndromic surveillance initially focused on animal health data collection strategies, analyzing historical data for their potential to support systematic monitoring, or solving problems of data classification and integration. Systems based on passive notification or data transfers are now dealing with sustainability issues. Given the ongoing barriers in availability of data, diagnostic laboratories appear to provide the most readily available data sources for syndromic surveillance in animal health. As the bottlenecks around data source availability are overcome, the next challenge is consolidating data standards for data classification, promoting the integration of different animal health surveillance systems, and also the integration to public health surveillance. Moreover, the outputs of systems for systematic monitoring of animal health data must be directly connected to real-time decision support systems which are increasingly being used for disease management and control.},

	abstract = {The objectives of this study were to investigate the relationship between dry matter intake (DMI) and urinary purine derivative (PD) excretion, to develop equations to predict DMI and to determine the endogenous excretion of PD for beef and dairy cattle using a meta-analytical approach. To develop the models, 62 published studies for both dairy (45 studies) and beef cattle (17 studies) were compiled. Twenty models were tested using DMI (kg/d) and digestible DMI (dDMI, kg/d) as response variables and PD:creatinine (linear term: PD:C, and quadratic term: PD:C2), allantoin:creatinine (linear term: ALLA:C, and quadratic term: ALLA:C2), metabolic body weight (BW0.75, kg), milk yield (MY, kg/d), and their combination as explanatory variables for dairy and beef (except for MY) cattle. The models developed to predict DMI for dairy cattle were validated using an independent data set from 2 research trials carried out at the University of Wisconsin (trial 1: n = 45; trial 2: n = 50). A second set of models was developed to estimate the endogenous PD excretion. In all evaluated models, the effect of PD (either as PD:C or ALLA:C) was significant, supporting our hypothesis that PD are in fact correlated with DMI. Despite the BW-independent relationship between PD and DMI, the inclusion of BW0.75 in the models with PD:C and ALLA:C as predictors slightly decreased the values of root mean square error (RMSE) and Akaike information criterion for the models of DMI. Our models suggest that both DMI and dDMI can be equally well predicted by PD-related variables; however, predicting DMI seems more useful from a practical and experimental standpoint. The inclusion of MY into the dairy models substantially decreased RMSE and Akaike information criterion values, and further increased the precision of the equations. The model including PD:C, BW0.75, and MY presented greater concordance correlation coefficient (0.93 and 0.63 for trials 1 and 2, respectively) and lower RMSE of prediction (1.90 and 3.35 kg/d for trials 1 and 2, respectively) when tested in the validation data set, emerging as a potentially useful estimator of nutrient intake in dairy cows. Endogenous PD excretion was estimated by the intercept of the linear regression between DMI (g/kg of BW0.75) and PD excretion (mmol/kg of BW0.75) for beef (0.404 mmol/kg of BW0.75) and dairy cattle (0.651 mmol/kg of BW0.75). Based on the very close agreement between our results for beef cattle and the literature, the linear regression appears to be an adequate method to estimate endogenous PD excretion.},

We review here studies of this type and attempt a meta-analysis of the available data. In the meta-analysis breeds of dogs were grouped into the eight categories of the American Kennel Club, and into four clusters identified by Parker and Ostrander [Parker, H.G., Ostrander, E.A., 2005.

While a number of factors were individually significant, the multivariate models identified significant effects only of 1) floor type (P = 0.003), sow BW at the end of gestation (P = 0.002), and housing (stalls vs. loose; P = 0.004) on BA; as floor type and housing were confounded, they were included in 2 separate models. The BA was higher on solid (12.1) in comparison to partly slatted (11.4) and fully slatted floors (10.2); 2) sow gestation environment (P = 0.017) and gestation feed allowance (P = 0.046) on BiW, with BiW of pigs higher for sows kept outdoors rather than indoors (1.75 versus 1.49 kg); 3) parity number (P = 0.003) and feed intake during gestation (P = 0.017) on WW; in addition there was an interaction between parity number x feed ME and parity number x feed CP content of feed during gestation on WW, with the positive effects of feed ME and CP contents seen during early rather than later parities; and 4) floor type (P = 0.019) and feed crude fiber (P = 0.003) for BA/FI with a greater number for those kept on solid floors (5.11) versus partially and fully slatted floors (4.07 and 4.05). The meta-analysis confirmed the significant effect of several well-known factors on the efficiency of gestating sows and, importantly, the interactions between these factors. In addition, the effects of some less established factors were noted, such as floor type. The results may contribute towards the improvement of efficiency of gestating sow systems by better understanding of the various factors that influence this.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are a number of different methods that can be used when estimating the size of the owned cat and dog population in a region, leading to varying population estimates. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review to evaluate the methods that have been used for estimating the sizes of owned cat and dog populations and to assess the biases associated with those methods.A comprehensive, systematic search of seven electronic bibliographic databases and the Google search engine was carried out using a range of different search terms for cats, dogs and population. The inclusion criteria were that the studies had involved owned or pet domestic dogs and/or cats, provided an estimate of the size of the owned dog or cat population, collected raw data on dog and cat ownership, and analysed primary data. Data relating to study methodology were extracted and assessed for biases. RESULTS: Seven papers were included in the final analysis. Collection methods used to select participants in the included studies were: mailed surveys using a commercial list of contacts, door to door surveys, random digit dialled telephone surveys, and randomised telephone surveys using a commercial list of numbers. Analytical and statistical methods used to estimate the pet population size were: mean number of dogs/cats per household multiplied by the number of households in an area, human density multiplied by number of dogs per human, and calculations using predictors of pet ownership. CONCLUSION: The main biases of the studies included selection bias, non-response bias, measurement bias and biases associated with length of sampling time. Careful design and planning of studies is a necessity before executing a study to estimate pet populations.},

The aims were: (a) through systematic literature review identify primary research with estimates of sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) for diagnostic tests for bTB in cattle (b) conduct a statistical meta-analysis to estimate test performance, and (c) using the estimates, model and compare different testing strategies. Of 9782 references reviewed, only 261 met agreed criteria and contained performance estimates for one or more of 14 diagnostic tests. The performance of bTB surveillance systems using the estimates of test performance was affected by the historical probability of herd freedom and the risk of introduction of infection. Where the probability of introduction of infection was high, it was difficult to achieve a high target probability of herd freedom from infection.},

	abstract = {Disease surveillance programmes ought to be evaluated regularly to ensure they provide valuable information in an efficient manner. Evaluation of human and animal health surveillance programmes around the world is currently not standardized and therefore inconsistent. The aim of this systematic review was to review surveillance system attributes and the methods used for their assessment, together with the strengths and weaknesses of existing frameworks for evaluating surveillance in animal health, public health and allied disciplines. Information from 99 articles describing the evaluation of 101 surveillance systems was examined. A wide range of approaches for assessing 23 different system attributes was identified although most evaluations addressed only one or two attributes and comprehensive evaluations were uncommon. Surveillance objectives were often not stated in the articles reviewed and so the reasons for choosing certain attributes for assessment were not always apparent. This has the potential to introduce misleading results in surveillance evaluation. Due to the wide range of system attributes that may be assessed, methods should be explored which collapse these down into a small number of grouped characteristics by focusing on the relationships between attributes and their links to the objectives of the surveillance system and the evaluation. A generic and comprehensive evaluation framework could then be developed consisting of a limited number of common attributes together with several sets of secondary attributes which could be selected depending on the disease or range of diseases under surveillance and the purpose of the surveillance. Economic evaluation should be an integral part of the surveillance evaluation process. This would provide a significant benefit to decision-makers who often need to make choices based on limited or diminishing resources.},

	abstract = {Brucellosis is a worldwide extended zoonosis with a heavy economic and public health impact. Cattle, sheep and goats are infected by smooth Brucella abortus and Brucella melitensis, and represent a common source of the human disease. Brucellosis diagnosis in these animals is largely based on detection of a specific immunoresponse. We review here the immunological tests used for the diagnosis of cattle brucellosis. First, we discuss how the diagnostic sensitivity (DSe) and specificity (DSp), balance should be adjusted for brucellosis diagnosis, and the difficulties that brucellosis tests specifically present for the estimation of DSe/DSp in frequentistic (gold standard) and Bayesian analyses. Then, we present a systematic review (PubMed, GoogleScholar and CABdirect) of works (154 out of 991; years 1960-August 2017) identified (by title and Abstract content) as DSe and DSp studies of smooth lipopolysaccharide, O-polysaccharide-core, native hapten and protein diagnostic tests. We summarize data of gold standard studies (n=23) complying with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria with regards to test methodology and definition of the animals studied (infected and S19 or RB51 vaccinated cattle, and Brucella-free cattle affected or not by false positive serological reactions). We also discuss some studies (smooth lipopolysaccharide tests, protein antibody and delayed type hypersensitivity [skin] tests) that do not meet the criteria and yet fill some of the gaps in information. We review Bayesian studies (n=5) and report that in most cases priors and assumptions on conditional dependence/independence are not coherent with the variable serological picture of the disease in different epidemiological scenarios and the bases (antigen, isotype and immunoglobulin properties involved) of brucellosis tests, practical experience and the results of gold standard studies. We conclude that very useful lipopolysaccharide (buffered plate antigen and indirect ELISA) and native hapten polysaccharide and soluble protein tests exist, provided they are applied taking into account the means available and the epidemiological contexts of this disease: i) mass vaccination; ii) elimination based on vaccination combined with test-and-slaughter; and iii) surveillance and existence of false positive serological reactions. We also conclude that the insistence in recent literature on the lack of usefulness of all smooth lipopolysaccharide or native hapten polysaccharide tests in areas where S19 vaccination is implemented is a misinterpretation that overlooks scientific and practical evidence.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis of the impact of monensin on growing and finishing beef cattle was conducted after a search of the literature. A total of 40 peer-reviewed articles and 24 additional trial reports with monensin feeding in beef cattle were selected, after meeting apriori quality criteria. Data for each trial were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis software in STATA. Estimated effect size of monensin was calculated for feed efficiency (FE), ADG, and DMI. Monensin use in growing and finishing beef cattle reduced DMI (P {\textless} 0.001) and improved both ADG (P {\textless} 0.001) and FE (P {\textless} 0.001). The average concentration of monensin in feed across studies was 28.1 mg/kg feed (100\% DM) and this resulted in approximately a 6.4\% (but only 2.5 to 3.5\% in the last 2 decades) increase in FE, 3\% decrease in DMI, and 2.5\% increase in ADG. All 3 outcomes displayed moderate and significant heterogeneity of monensin response (I(2), which is a measure of variation beyond chance, = 29\% for FE, 42\% for DMI, and 23\% for ADG); therefore, random effects models were used for those outcomes. There were no single influential studies that overweighted the findings for any outcome. Meta-regression analysis of the effect sizes obtained from these data showed that dietary factors, dose, and study design were influential in modifying effect size of monensin treatment. Use of corn silage in the diet influenced the effect size of monensin for DMI and FE, with diets containing corn silage resulting in a greater improvement in FE and a larger effect on reducing DMI. Studies conducted to assess multiple doses of monensin showed similar effects to the use of corn silage in the diet. Studies conducted in the United States or with higher ADG in control animals ({\textgreater}1.17 kg/d) showed less effect of monensin on ADG. Pen-level studies showed a greater monensin increase on ADG than did those conducted on individual animals. Linear effect of monensin dose was observed for FE, DMI, and ADG outcomes, with greater effects on improving FE and reducing DMI with larger doses of monensin but lesser improvement in ADG with increasing dose. These findings confirm that monensin improves FE in growing and finishing beef cattle, and that this effect is linear with dose.},

A total of 16 papers were identified with sufficient data and quality to evaluate health and reproductive outcomes for monensin. The available trials provided approximately 9,500 cows with sufficient data for analysis. This provided good statistical power to examine the effects of monensin on health and reproduction. Over all the trials analyzed, monensin decreased the risk of ketosis [relative risk (RR) = 0.75], displaced abomasums (RR = 0.75), and mastitis (RR = 0.91). No significant effects of monensin were found for milk fever, lameness, dystocia, retained placenta, or metritis. Monensin had no effect on first-service conception risk (RR = 0.97) or days to pregnancy (hazard ratio = 0.93). However, the impact of monensin on dystocia, retained placenta, and metritis was heterogeneous for all 3 outcome measures and random effect models were utilized. Causes of the heterogeneity were explored with meta-regression. Days of treatment with monensin before calving increased the risk of dystocia. Delivery method of monensin influenced the incidence of retained placenta and metritis, with risk being lower with controlled release capsule treatment compared with delivery in either topdress or in a total mixed ration. Days of treatment before calving also influenced retained placenta with an increase in risk with more days treated before calving. Improvements in ketosis, displaced abomasums, and mastitis with monensin were achieved. Exposure to prolonged treatment in the dry period with monensin may increase the risk of dystocia and retained placenta.},

Statistical analyses were conducted in STATA and included a consideration of fixed or random effects models, assessment of publication bias, and impact of influential studies. Meta-regression was used to investigate sources of heterogeneity of response. There were 71 trials containing data from 255 trial sites and 9,677 cows examining milk production and composition. Monensin use in lactating dairy cattle significantly decreased dry matter intake by 0.3 kg, but increased milk yield by 0.7 kg and improved milk production efficiency by 2.5\%. Monensin decreased milk fat percentage 0.13\%, but had no effect on milk fat yield; however, there was significant heterogeneity between studies for both of these responses. Milk protein percentage was decreased 0.03\%, but protein yield was increased 0.016 kg/d with treatment. Monensin had no effect on milk lactose percentage. Monensin increased body condition score by 0.03 and similarly improved body weight change (0.06 kg/d). Analysis of milk fatty acid profile data indicated that monensin was associated with a reduction of short-chain fatty acids (from 1 to 12\% reduction) and stearic acid (-7.8\%). The impact of monensin on linoleic and linolenic acids was variable, but monensin significantly increased conjugated linoleic acid (22\%). Meta-regression of the effect of monensin on milk component percentages and yields indicated an influence of delivery method, stage of lactation, dose, and diet. Increasing concentrations of C18:1 in the diet enhanced the effect of monensin on decreasing milk fat yield, whereas increasing the rumen peptide balance increased the effect of monensin on milk protein yield. These findings indicate a benefit of monensin for improving milk production efficiency while maintaining body condition. The effect of monensin on milk fat percentage and yield was influenced by diet.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis of the impact of monensin on metabolism of dairy cattle was conducted following a search of the literature. A total of 59 studies with monensin feeding in dairy cattle were identified in which 30 papers and 45 trials contained metabolic data. The beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) data were obtained from over 4,000 cows and 115 trial sites. Data for each trial were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis software in Stata. Estimated effect sizes of monensin were calculated on blood concentrations of BHBA, acetoacetate, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), glucose, cholesterol, urea, calcium, insulin, and milk urea. Monensin use in lactating dairy cattle significantly reduced blood concentrations of BHBA 13\%, acetoacetate 14\%, and NEFA 7\%. Monensin increased glucose 3\% and urea 6\%. Monensin had no significant effect on cholesterol, calcium, milk urea, or insulin. Heterogeneity was significant for BHBA and cholesterol [I(2) (measure of variation beyond chance) = 37 and 54\%, respectively]; therefore, random effects models were used for those analytes. Publication bias existed with the monensin effect on BHBA, with a tendency for studies to be published if there was a significant reduction in this ketone. Meta-regression analysis of the effect sizes obtained from the metabolic data showed that method of delivery, timing of administration, stage of lactation, and diet were influential in modifying effect size of monensin treatment. Use of top dress or delivery via a controlled release capsule reduced the magnitude of effect on BHBA (coefficient +0.353); however, top dress use compared with controlled release capsule or total mixed ration enhanced the monensin effect on glucose (coefficient +0.296). There was a greater impact with monensin on reducing BHBA in early lactation (coefficient -0.151) and in pasture-based trials (coefficient -0.194). Use of monensin in both the pre- and postcalving periods was associated with an enhanced impact on NEFA (coefficient -0.254). Monensin had less impact on serum glucose in the pre-calving time period (coefficient -0.237). These findings demonstrate an improvement in the energy metabolism of dairy cows supplemented with monensin.},

	abstract = {A systematic review of the scientific literature on relationships between management practices used on dairy farms and herd somatic cell count (SCC) was undertaken to distinguish those management practices that have been consistently shown to be associated with herd SCC from those lacking evidence of association. Relevant literature was identified using a combination of database searches (PubMed, Medline, CAB, Agricola, and Web of Science) and iterative screening of references. To be included in the review, a manuscript had to be published after 1979 in French, English, or Dutch; study design had to be other than case report or case series; herds studied had to be composed of {\textgreater}/= 40 milking cows producing on average {\textgreater}/= 7,000kg of milk in 305 d; interventions studied had to be management practices applied at the herd level and used as udder health control strategies; and SCC had to be measured using electronic cell counting methods. The 36 manuscripts selected were mainly observational cross-sectional studies; 8 manuscripts dealt exclusively with automatic milking systems and 4 with management of calves and heifers and its effect on SCC in early lactation heifers. Most practices having consistent associations with SCC were related to milking procedures: wearing gloves during milking, using automatic take-offs, using postmilking teat dipping, milking problem cows last, yearly inspection of the milking system, and use of a technique to keep cows standing following milking; all were consistently associated with lower herd SCC. Other practices associated with lower SCC were the use of a freestall system, sand bedding, cleaning the calving pen after each calving, surveillance of dry-cow udders for mastitis, use of blanket dry-cow therapy, parenteral selenium supplementation, udder hair management, and frequent use of the California Mastitis Test. Regarding SCC of heifers, most of the consistent associations reported were related to interventions made during the peripartum period. Studies on automatic milking systems have frequently reported elevation of the herd SCC following transition to the new system. These elevations seemed to be mediated both by the lack of monitoring of chronically infected cows and by an elevated incidence of intramammary infections. By assembling the results reported in many different studies, this review generates a more comprehensive understanding of the management practices influencing SCC and highlights areas of SCC control knowledge that lack evidence of effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Globally, the eradication of bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is still in its infancy, but eradication has been, or is being, adopted by several countries or regions. Comparisons between countries' schemes allow others to assess best practice, and aggregating published results from eradication schemes provides greater statistical power when analysing data. Aggregating data requires that results derived from different testing schemes be calibrated against one another. The authors aimed to evaluate whether relationships between published BVDV test results could be created and present the outcome of a systematic literature review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The results are tabulated, providing a summary of papers where there is potential cross-calibration and a summary of the obstacles preventing such data aggregation. Although differences in measuring BVDV present barriers to academic progress, they may also affect progress within individual eradication schemes. The authors examined the time taken to retest following an initial antibody BVDV test in the Scottish eradication scheme. The authors demonstrate that retesting occurred quicker if the initial not negative test was from blood rather than milk samples. Such differences in the response of farmers/veterinarians to tests may be of interest to the design of future schemes.},

	doi = {10.1111/vec.12275},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To discuss controversies surrounding antimicrobial use in critically ill horses. DATA SOURCES: PubMed searches from 1970-present for terms including, but not limited to: "horse," "foal," "antimicrobial," "prophylaxis," "infection," "surgery," "sepsis," and "antimicrobial resistance." HUMAN DATA SYNTHESIS: Increasing bacterial antimicrobial resistance has changed first-line antimicrobial choices and prompted shortening of the duration of prophylactic and therapeutic treatment. The need to decrease bacterial resistance development to critically important antimicrobials has been highlighted. VETERINARY DATA SYNTHESIS: Veterinary medicine has followed a similar trend but often without a high-level evidence. Common dilemmas include diseases in which the theoretically most effective drug is a reserved antimicrobial, the inability to differentiate infectious from noninfectious disease, the duration and necessity of prophylactic antimicrobials and use of antimicrobials in primary gastrointestinal disease. These problems are illustrated using examples of purulent infections, neonatal sepsis, colic surgery, and treatment of colitis. Although enrofloxacin, cephalosporins, and doxycycline, in contrast to gentamicin, reach therapeutic concentrations within the lungs of healthy horses, the first two should not be used as first line treatment due to their reserved status. Due to the high risk of bacterial sepsis, antimicrobial treatment remains indispensable in compromised neonatal foals but shortening the length of antimicrobial treatment might be prudent. One prospective randomized study demonstrated no difference between 3 and 5 days of perioperative antimicrobial treatment in colic surgery but shorter durations were not evaluated. High-level evidence to recommend antimicrobial treatment of adult horses with undifferentiated diarrhea does not exist. CONCLUSIONS: Few evidence-based recommendations can be made. Commonly used antimicrobial combinations remain the mainstay for treating purulent infections. Antimicrobial treatment for compromised foals should not extend beyond recovery. Continuation of prophylactic antimicrobials {\textgreater}3 days is likely unnecessary after colic surgery; shorter durations might be equally effective. Antimicrobial prophylaxis in adult horses with diarrhea is unlikely to be beneficial.},

	abstract = {Foot lesions causing lameness in dairy cows are important economic and welfare issues. Prompt and correct detection and diagnosis are critical for improving economic and welfare outcomes. Few tests are currently available to aid the dairy farmer in the detection and diagnosis of foot lesions. The objectives of this systematic review were to identify those tests that have been investigated for the detection and diagnosis of foot lesions causing lameness in dairy cows, evaluate the methodological quality of the studies investigating the identified tests, compare the accuracy of the identified test, and determine which tests can be recommended for implementation on the farm based on accuracy and practicality for use by dairy farmers. A comprehensive literature search resulted in 2137 papers. After removing duplicates and performing relevance screening, 12 papers with 20 studies met the inclusion criteria. Pertinent data from each study were extracted using a standardised form. Eligible studies were grouped based on the objective of the test under investigation, resulting in the following groups of disorders: lameness, foot lesions, sole ulcer, and digital dermatitis. Methodological quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool which includes four domains: animal selection, index test, reference test and flow and timing. Incomplete reporting in the studies limited the assessment of methodological quality. The animal selection domain was particularly poorly reported. No single study could be classified as being at low risk of bias across all domains of the QUADAS-2 tool. One automated test was identified, while all others were manually operated. No studies reported the cost of the test in question and only two studies reported the time taken to carry out the procedures involved with using the test in question. It was not possible to compare the accuracy of these tests or recommend which tests are suitable for implementation on the farm. This was due to incomplete reporting of information and significant risk of bias in all studies.},

	abstract = {Routine procedures carried out on piglets (i.e. castration, tail docking, teeth clipping, and ear notching) are considered painful. Unfortunately the efficacy of current pain mitigation modalities is poorly understood. The aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the existing primary scientific literature regarding the effectiveness of pain management interventions used for routine procedures on piglets. The review question was, 'In piglets under twenty-eight days old, undergoing castration, tail docking, teeth clipping, and/or methods of identification that involve cutting of the ear tissue, what is the effect of pain mitigation compared with no pain mitigation on behavioral and non-behavioral outcomes that indicate procedural pain and post-procedural pain?' A review protocol was designed a priori. Data sources used were Agricola (EBSCO), CAB Abstracts (Thomson Reuters), PubMed, Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), BIOSIS Previews (Thomson Reuters), and ProQuest Dissertations \& Theses Full Text. No restrictions on year of publication or language were placed on the search. Eligible studies assessed an intervention designed to mitigate the pain of the procedures of interest and included a comparison group that did not receive an intervention. Eligible non-English studies were translated using a translation service. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance using pre-defined questions. Data were extracted from relevant articles onto pre-defined forms. From the 2203 retrieved citations forty publications, containing 52 studies met the eligibility criteria. In 40 studies, piglets underwent castration only. In seven studies, piglets underwent tail docking only. In one study, piglets underwent teeth clipping only, and in one study piglets underwent ear notching only. Three studies used multiple procedures. Thirty-two trial arms assessed general anesthesia protocols, 30 trial arms assessed local anesthetic protocols, and 28 trial arms assessed non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) protocols. Forty-one trial arms were controls where piglets received either placebo or no treatment. Forty-five outcomes were extracted from the studies, however only the results from studies that assessed cortisol (six studies), beta -endorphins (one study), vocalisations (nine studies), and pain-related behaviors (nine studies) are reported. Other outcomes were reported in only one or two studies. Confident decision making will likely be difficult based on this body of work because lack of comprehensive reporting precludes calculation of the magnitude of pain mitigation for most outcomes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Foodborne diseases caused by non-typhoid Salmonella and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance remain as a public health challenge, especially in developing countries. The current study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence and the antimicrobial resistance patterns of non-typhoid Salmonella in Ethiopia. METHODS: Literature search was conducted from major electronic databases and indexing services. Both published and unpublished studies addressing the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance profiles of Salmonella in Ethiopia from 2010 to 2020 and those studies reported sample size and the numbers of isolates/number of positive samples were included in the study. Data were extracted using format prepared in Microsoft Excel. The identified data were exported to EndNote to remove duplicated studies, then after the remained articles were screened using title, abstract, and full text to identify studies that meet the inclusion criteria and finally appraised for methodological validity using JBI guideline. The pooled prevalence of Salmonella and its drug resistance pattern was computed by a random-effects model. I(2) test statistic was used to test heterogeneity across studies. The presence of publication bias was evaluated using the Begg's and Egger's tests. RESULTS: A total of 49 eligible articles, 33 of them on human stools, 15 of them on animal origin foods, and one both on human stools and animal origin foods, were included in the study. The pooled prevalence of Salmonella among human stools and animal origin foods in Ethiopia was 4.8\% (95\% CI: 3.9, 5.9) and 7.7\% (95\% CI: 5.6, 10.4), respectively. The subgroup analysis detected high pooled prevalence, 7.6\% (95\% CI: 5.3, 10.7) among outpatients and low, 3.7\% (95\% CI: 2.6, 5.1) in food handlers. The pooled resistant level of Salmonella was 80.6\% (95\% CI 72.6, 86.7) for ampicillin and 63.5\% (95\% CI 53.7, 72.4) for tetracycline. Low pooled resistance pattern was reported in ciprofloxacin, 8.7\% (95\% CI 5.6, 13.3) and ceftriaxone 12.2\% (95\% CI 7.9, 18.3). There was some sort of publication bias. CONCLUSION: High pooled prevalence of Salmonella among human stools and animal origin foods which were 4.8\% and 7.7\% respectively, and high Salmonella resistance, {\textgreater}72\% to ampicillin and tetracycline were detected in Ethiopia. Antimicrobial stewardship efforts and infection control strategies are required to mitigate this major public health concern.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Robopets are small animal-like robots which have the appearance and behavioural characteristics of pets. OBJECTIVE: To bring together the evidence of the experiences of staff, residents and family members of interacting with robopets and the effects of robopets on the health and well-being of older people living in care homes. DESIGN: Systematic review of qualitative and quantitative research. DATA SOURCES: We searched 13 electronic databases from inception to July 2018 and undertook forward and backward citation chasing. METHODS: Eligible studies reported the views and experiences of robopets from residents, family members and staff (qualitative studies using recognised methods of qualitative data collection and analysis) and the effects of robopets on the health and well-being of care home residents (randomised controlled trials, randomised crossover trials and cluster randomised trials). Study selection was undertaken independently by two reviewers. We used the Wallace criteria and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to assess the quality of the evidence. We developed a logic model with stakeholders and used this as a framework to guide data extraction and synthesis. Where appropriate, we used meta-analysis to combine effect estimates from quantitative studies. RESULTS: Nineteen studies (10 qualitative, 2 mixed methods and 7 randomised trials) met the inclusion criteria. Interactions with robopets were described as having a positive impact on aspects of well-being including loneliness, depression and quality of life by residents and staff, although there was no corresponding statistically significant evidence from meta-analysis for these outcomes. Meta-analysis showed evidence of a reduction in agitation with the robopet "Paro" compared to control (-0.32 [95\% CI -0.61 to -0.04, p = 0.03]). Not everyone had a positive experience of robopets. CONCLUSIONS: Engagement with robopets appears to have beneficial effects on the health and well-being of older adults living in care homes, but not all chose to engage. Whether the benefits can be sustained are yet to be investigated. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Robopets have the potential to benefit people living in care homes, through increasing engagement and interaction. With the robopet acting as a catalyst, this engagement and interaction may afford comfort and help reduce agitation and loneliness.},

METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of eligible studies published in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science from January 1, 1950 to August 30, 2020. Peer-reviewed cross-sectional studies describing WNV infections in humans and animals were systematically reviewed. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane Q statistic. RESULTS: Eighteen out of 432 available search output were eligible and included for this study. Of which 13 and 5 were WNV studies on humans and animals, respectively. Although 61.5\% of the human studies had a low risk of bias, they all had high heterogeneity. The South West geopolitical zone of Nigeria had the highest pooled prevalence of anti-WNV immunoglobulin M (IgM; 7.8\% in humans). The pooled seroprevalence of anti-WNV IgM and immunoglobulin G (IgG) was 7.1\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 5.9 to 8.3) and 76.5\% (95\% CI, 74.0 to 78.8), respectively. The WNV RNA prevalence was 1.9\% (95\% CI, 1.4 to 2.9), while 14.3\% (95\% CI, 12.9 to 15.8) had WNV-neutralizing antibodies. In animals, the pooled seroprevalence of anti-WNV IgM and IgG was 90.3\% (95\% CI, 84.3 to 94.6) and 3.5\% (95\% CI, 1.9 to 5.8), respectively, while 20.0\% (95\% CI, 12.9 to 21.4) had WNV-neutralizing antibodies.

The objective of the present study was to systematically review and summarize the studies regarding the prevalence of Brucella spp. in milk and milk products in the Middle East region. Some international databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar) were searched to retrieve relevant reports published between 1 January 2008 and 30th October 2018. After assessing for eligibility, 30 articles containing 9281 samples, were included in the current study. The highest number of publications were found in Iran and Turkey (n = 12 and 7, respectively), while Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Syria had the lowest number of publications (n = 1). Besides, the highest and lowest prevalence was observed in Kuwait (62\%) and Egypt (15\%), respectively. The highest and lowest overall prevalence of Brucella spp. in milk was found in raw cow milk 36\% (95\%CI: 28-54\%) and raw buffalo milk 13\% (95\%CI: -22-48\%), respectively. The overall prevalence in cheese estimated to be 9\% (95\%CI: -16-35\%). The overall prevalence of Brucella spp. in dairy products in the Middle East was estimated to be 29\% (95\%CI: 23-35\%). The results indicate that more risk management plans are needed to reduce the incidence of Brucella spp. in dairy products in the Middle East, especially in cow milk.},

Moreover, the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks of Pb and Cd through milk consumption in adult and child consumers were assessed. As a result of a systematic search in the international and national databases between January 2008 and October 2018, 17 reports involving 1874 samples were incorporated in our study for meta-analysis. The pooled concentrations of Pb and Cd were estimated to be 13.95 μg mL(-1) (95\% CI 9.72-18.11 μg mL(-1)) and 3.55 μg mL(-1) (95\% CI - 2.38-9.48 μg mL(-1)), respectively, which were lower than the WHO/FAO and national standard limits. The estimated weekly intake (EWI) of Pb and Cd through consuming milk was 16.65 and 7 μg day(-1) for adults of 70 kg and 45 and 34 μg day(-1) for children of 26 kg, respectively, which was well below the risk values set by Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The maximum target hazard quotient values (THQs) of Pb and Cd were 5.55E-5 and 5.55E-5 for adults and 5.55E-5 and 5.55E-5 for children, respectively, which were lower than 1 value, suggesting that Iranian consumers are not exposed to non-carcinogenic risk through consuming milk. Moreover, the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) of Pb estimated to be 2.96E-04 in adults and 1.0E-03 in children, indicating that consumers in Iran are at threshold carcinogenic risk of Pb through consuming milk (ILCR {\textgreater} 10(-4)). Therefore, planning and policy making for the sustainable reduction of these toxic metals in milk, particularly in industrial regions of Iran, are crucial.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rabies is a fatal disease that still kills 2-6 people a year in Iran. A meta-analysis was conducted in order to generate accurate data on animal bite exposure, and to estimate the incidence of animal bite across the country. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Major national and international electronic databases were searched using the keywords "animal bite," rabies, prevalence, incidence, and Iran. Web of Knowledge, PubMed, Scopus, Ovid, and ScienceDirect were used as international databases, and the national databases included Science Information Database, MagIran, and IranDoc. Descriptive cross-sectional studies addressing the incidence of animal bite were selected and screened by two authors, and pre-specified data were extracted. The population of provinces or cities of studies was extracted from the Statistical Centre of Iran. The overall incidence of animal bite in Iran was estimated using a random-effects model with 95\% confidence interval (CI). Study quality was assessed using the STROBE recommended checklist. RESULTS: A total of 34 studies were selected for the meta-analysis out of 1215 retrieved studies. The number of animal bites in the studies during 1993-2013 was 230,019 cases. The overall estimated incidence rate of animal bite in Iran was 13.20/1000 (95\%, CI 12.10, 14.30) and the mean age of people was 26.23 (SD = 5.02) year. The incidence rate of animal bite among males (14.90/1000) was much higher than females (4.55/1000), and was higher in rural areas (17.45/1000) compared with urban areas (4.35/1000). The incident rate was highest among students compared with other reported occupations. The incidence rate of dogs was 10.40/1000 followed by cats, cows, wolves, jackals, and foxes. Domestic animals had a higher incidence rate than stray and wild animals. The incidence rate of animal bite during spring was 4.90/1000; however, the incidence rate in other seasons had no significant difference. In the retrieved studies, the highest incidence rate of animal bite was found in the West Azerbaijan Province (146.83/1000). CONCLUSION: The current study is the first comprehensive analysis of the published animal bite studies in Iran. Accurate data on animal bite incidence may lead to more effective policy-decisions towards more efficient resource allocation to primary health care for reducing rabies case. Such information is a primary and major necessity for rabies control program in the country. Animal bite reduction can significantly minimize the risk of rabies infection, thereby reducing public health costs for the expensive post-exposure treatment.},

	abstract = {Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the intracellular bacterium, Coxiella burnetii. Its primary mode of transmission is by inhalation of aerosols originating from infected animals and contaminated environments. The organism has a very low infective dose, can persist in the environment for long periods of time and large outbreaks fuelled by windborne spread have been previously reported. Detection of C. burnetii in the environment is therefore important during human and animal outbreak investigations and for the control and prevention of Q fever. This study aimed to systematically review and critically appraise the published literature on sampling methods used to detect C. burnetii from different environmental samples. A search of four electronic databases with subsequent hand searching identified 47 eligible articles published since 1935. These articles described sampling of dust, air, soil and liquids in attempts to detect C. burnetii during 19 Q fever outbreaks and in 28 endemic settings. Environmental positivity was most commonly associated with ruminant livestock populations. Evidence describing spatio-temporal characteristics and associated geographical dispersion gradients was limited. The most commonly tested sample type was dust which also yielded the highest bacterial loads of {\textgreater}10(8) bacteria/cloth. The MD8 (Sartorius) air sampler was used widely for air sampling. Soil was the only sample type for which a validated laboratory protocol was established specifically for C. burnetii. Each environmental sample type has its advantages and limitations which are discussed in detail and a simplified framework to guide decisions around environmental sampling for C. burnetii is provided. In any type of environmental sampling, it is recommended to use standardized and validated methods and to match the most ideal sampling strategy and timing with the research context. These conditions are essential to be considered when designing future Q fever management plans that involve environmental sampling for C. burnetii.},

	abstract = {The rise of anthelmintic resistance worldwide has led to the development of alternative control strategies for gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) infections, which are one of the main constraints on the health of grazing small ruminants. Presently, breeding schemes rely mainly on fecal egg count (FEC) measurements on infected animals which are time-consuming and requires expertise in parasitology. Identifying and understanding the role of immunoglobulins in the mechanisms of resistance could provide a more efficient and sustainable method of identifying nematode-resistant animals for selection. In this study we review the findings on immunoglobulin response to GIN in the literature published to date (june 2019) and discuss the potential to use immunoglobulins as biomarkers. The literature review revealed 41 studies which measured at least one immunoglobulin: 35 focused on lamb immune response (18 used non-naïve lambs) and 7 on yearlings. In this review we propose a conceptual model summarizing the role of immunoglobulins in resistance to GIN. We highlight the need for more carefully designed and documented studies to allow comparisons across different populations on the immunoglobulin response to GIN infection.},

	abstract = {The global burden of neurodegenerative disorders has increased substantially over the past 2 decades due to rising rates of population aging. Although neurodegenerative disorders differ in their clinical presentation, the underlying pathobiological processes are largely shared. Oxidative stress, among other mechanisms, is strongly implicated in neurodegenerative disorders and aging, and can potentially be targeted by antioxidative agents. Curcumin, a component of turmeric, is a compound that has received considerable attention for its therapeutic properties, and it is considered to be a powerful antioxidant. In this review, we analyzed the evidence for curcumin as an antioxidant in models of neurodegenerative disorders as well as oxido-nitrosative stress. A total of 1451 articles were found from 3 scientific literature databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science). After all exclusions, a final total of 64 articles were included in this review. The majority of the studies showed that curcumin, or derivatives thereof, were protective against oxidative and/or nitrosative stress in various cellular and animal models. Overall, curcumin protected against lipid and protein oxidation with a reduction in levels of malondialdehyde, and protein carbonyls, thiols and nitrotyrosines. Furthermore, it stimulated the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. In conclusion, curcumin appears to be a promising compound for phytomedicine. However, due to some concerns about its efficacy, further targeted experiments are needed to identify its exact molecular targets and pathways responsible for its antioxidant effects.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify which classification systems have been used for tumor margin reporting and to determine whether factors (publication year, tumor type, and specialty of the contributing authors) influenced trends in margin reporting within literature describing canine soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and cutaneous mast cell tumors (MCT). STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review. METHODS: Eligible articles were identified through electronic database searches performed for STS and MCT. Data abstracted from relevant studies included publication year, author list, specialty of contributing authors, criteria used to report the planned surgical margins, and the status of histologic margins. Categorization of papers was based on the classification systems used to report surgical and histologic tumor margins. RESULTS: Fifty-three articles were included, 11 on STS, 37 on MCT, and five that included both tumor types. Criteria for classifying the planned surgical margins were described in only 50.9\% of studies. Articles that listed a veterinary surgeon as a contributing author (P = .01) and STS articles compared to MCT papers (P = .01) were more likely to report surgical margins. Most (56.6\%) studies reported the status of histologic margins dichotomously as "complete" or "incomplete." Although a previously published consensus statement recommended that quantitative criteria be used to report histologic margins, only 7.5\% of articles used quantitative methods. CONCLUSION: Classification systems used for reporting tumor margins were highly variable among studies. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The findings of this review provide evidence that a standardized classification system for reporting surgical and histologic tumor margins is required in veterinary medicine. A universal system may support more consistent reporting of neoplastic biopsy specimens and allow for more meaningful comparisons across research studies.},

	abstract = {The virulence-transmission trade-off hypothesis proposed more than 30 years ago is the cornerstone in the study of host-parasite co-evolution. This hypothesis rests on the premise that virulence is an unavoidable and increasing cost because the parasite uses host resources to replicate. This cost associated with replication ultimately results in a deceleration in transmission rate because increasing within-host replication increases host mortality. Empirical tests of predictions of the hypothesis have found mixed support, which cast doubt about its overall generalizability. To quantitatively address this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis of 29 empirical studies, after reviewing over 6000 published papers, addressing the four core relationships between (1) virulence and recovery rate, (2) within-host replication rate and virulence, (3) within-host replication and transmission rate, and (4) virulence and transmission rate. We found strong support for an increasing relationship between replication and virulence, and replication and transmission. Yet, it is still uncertain if these relationships generally decelerate due to high within-study variability. There was insufficient data to quantitatively test the other two core relationships predicted by the theory. Overall, the results suggest that the current empirical evidence provides partial support for the trade-off hypothesis, but more work remains to be done.},

Using paired samples of females' blood (n = 564) and their eggs (n = 1814) from 26 bird species in 6 taxonomic orders, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate whether maternal transfer of MeHg to eggs differed among species and caused differential toxicity risk to embryos. Total mercury (THg) concentrations in eggs increased with maternal blood THg concentrations; however, the proportion of THg transferred from females to their eggs differed among bird taxa and with maternal THg exposure. Specifically, a smaller proportion of maternal THg was transferred to eggs with increasing female THg concentrations. Additionally, the proportion of THg that was transferred to eggs at the same maternal blood THg concentration differed among taxonomic orders, with waterfowl (Anseriformes) transferring up to 382\% more THg into their eggs than songbirds (Passeriformes). We provide equations to predict THg concentrations in eggs using female blood THg concentrations, and vice versa, which may help translate toxicity benchmarks across tissues and life stages.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Climate change plays an important role in the geographic spread of zoonotic diseases. Knowing which populations are at risk of contracting these diseases is critical to informing public health policies and practices. In Québec, 14 zoonoses have been identified as important for public health to guide the climate change adaptation efforts of decision-makers and researchers. A great deal has been learned about these diseases in recent years, but information on at-risk workplaces remains incomplete. The objective of this study is to paint a portrait of the occupations and sectors of economic activity at risk for the acquisition of these zoonoses. METHODS: A rapid review of the scientific literature was conducted. Databases on the Ovid and EBSCO research platforms were searched for articles published between 1995 and 2018, in English and French, on 14 zoonoses (campylobacteriosis, cryptosporidiosis, verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli, giardiasis, listeriosis, salmonellosis, Eastern equine encephalitis, Lyme disease, West Nile virus, food botulism, Q fever, avian and swine influenza, rabies, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) and occupational health. The literature search retrieved 12,558 articles and, after elimination of duplicates, 6,838 articles were evaluated based on the title and the abstract. Eligible articles had to address both concepts of the research issue (prioritized zoonoses and worker health). Of the 621 articles deemed eligible, 110 were selected following their full reading. RESULTS: Of the diseases under study, enteric zoonoses were the most frequently reported. Agriculture, including veterinary services, public administration services and medical and social services were the sectors most frequently identified in the literature. CONCLUSION: The results of our study will support public health authorities and decision-makers in targeting those sectors and occupations that are particularly at risk for the acquisition of zoonoses. Doing so will ultimately optimize the public health practices of those responsible for the health of workers.},

Databases used: Pertinent literature was searched with PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Universitatsbibliothek Basel (swissbib Basel Bern) and Google Scholar. The search was then refined manually based first on article titles and abstracts, and subsequently on full texts. Conclusions: Of the four classical acute nociceptive models used for NTT, thermal and mechanical are most commonly used in cats. Thermal stimulation is applicable in experimental settings and has been used in pharmacodynamics studies assessing feline antinociception. Although mechanical stimulation is currently less used in cats, in the future it might play a role in the evaluation of clinical feline pain. However, the low response reliability after stimulus repetition within a narrow time interval represents a major limitation for the clinical use of mechanical thresholds in this species. Challenges remain when thermal thresholds are used to investigate analgesics that have the potential to affect skin temperature, such as opioids and a2-adrenergic agonists, and when a model of inflammatory pain is reproduced in experimental cats with the purpose of evaluating non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as analgesics.},

	abstract = {Ticks are a large group of parasitic arthropods which transmit pathogens to animals and humans, causing great economic losses. Chemical-based antitick measures include the use of pyrethroids, carbamates, organophosphates, formamidines and macrocyclic lactones, which all have associated costs, resistance-development and environmental hazards. Some plant-based alternatives may have good efficacy, low toxicity and reduced environmental impacts. A review of published scientific articles was conducted for medicinal plants with in vitro tick repellent or acaricidal activities against immature and adult stages of ticks. Veterinary databases (All Databases, CAB Abstracts and Global Health, PubMed, Web of Science, BIOSIS Citation Index, Science Direct, Current Content Connect and Google Scholar) were used. The search words were "acaricidal", "tick repellent", "medicinal plants", "phytochemical constituents" and "antitick assays". To investigate correlations, meta-analysis was conducted using the Fixed-effect model in an Excel programme. The different plant parts, extractants used and their efficacies, where available are listed. Extracts of some species including Azadirachta indica, Gynandropsis gynandra, Lavandula angustifolia, Pelargonium roseum and Cymbopogon species have good acaricidal and larvicidal effects with 90-100\% efficacy, comparable to those of currently used synthetic acaricides. Bioassays used in the determination of repellent, acaricidal, larvicidal, inhibition of oviposition and hatchability include tick climbing repellency, Petri dish, larval packet and immersion tests amongst others. Using a total of 1 428, 1 924, 574, 281 and 68 events, the median efficiency value for acaricidal, larvicidal, egg hatching inhibition, inhibition of oviposition, repellency, acaricidal effects of the Lamiaceae and Asteraceae families were 80.12 (CI$_{\textrm{95\%}}$: 79.20-81.04), 86.05 (CI$_{\textrm{95\%}}$: 85.13-86.97), 83.39 (CI$_{\textrm{95\%}}$: 82.47-84.31), 53.01 (CI$_{\textrm{95\%}}$: 52.08-53.93), 92.00 (CI$_{\textrm{95\%}}$: 91.08-92.93), 80.79 (CI$_{\textrm{95\%}}$: 79.87-81.71) and 48.34\% (CI$_{\textrm{95\%}}$: 47.42-49.26) respectively. Among the 26 isolated active compounds identified, some such as azadirachtin, carvacrol, linalool, geraniol and citronellal and their potential uses are discussed. While plant species used in ethnoveterinary medicine hold vast potential as parasiticides, the variations in testing methodologies and assay conditions make comparison among studies very problematic. The standardization of components, extraction techniques and experimental design is urgently required to fully explore their potential.},

	abstract = {We aimed to determine how research regarding farmers' personalities and attitudes as risk factors is reported (methodological approaches to assessing, extracting, and processing data and analyzing risk factors) and to explore evidence for the effect of farmers' attitudes and personalities on dairy cattle health, welfare, productivity, and management. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of studies on personality and attitude as risk factors for dairy cattle health, welfare, productivity, and farm management. Database searches captured 1,144 records, and 38 were finally included in the review. Thirty-three manuscripts assessed farmers' attitudes, 1 assessed their personalities, and 4 assessed both as risk factors. These potential risk factors were checked for relationships with more than 50 different outcome variables regarding farm management (17 manuscripts), animal health (13 manuscripts), animal productivity (11 manuscripts), and animal welfare (4 manuscripts). The approaches to assessing risk factors and processing and interpreting data varied greatly; thus, drawing conclusions regarding the effects of attitude and personality as risk factors is impeded because manuscripts are difficult to compare. Our findings highlight the need for harmonization of attitudes and personality assessments in future research. Furthermore, researchers should carefully consider which depth of detail to apply when planning and evaluating related research. Nevertheless, results highlight the importance of the effect of personality and attitude on outcomes. Farmers' personality and attitudes are associated with dairy cattle health, welfare, productivity, and management. In general, attitudes indicating higher degrees of technical knowledge, affection with problems, perceived responsibility, perception of control of a situation, a better human-animal relationship, or a positive evaluation of the benefits of management decisions tended to affect outcomes in a beneficial way. "Agreeableness" and "conscientiousness" were shown to promote better farm performance, whereas "neuroticism" had a negative effect. Therefore, further research on attitude and personality and their consideration by professionals and decision-makers within the dairy sector and politics is strongly recommended. This might provide the chance to better understand the needs of dairy farmers and therefore develop tailored advice and support strategies to improve both satisfactory and constructive cooperation.},

A literature search and systematic review was conducted to identify EO water intervention studies to reduce Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes on poultry, eggs, meat, fish and produce. Pathogen reduction data from the included studies were utilized in the estimation of effect sizes (mean log reductions) and heterogeneity assessment between studies (I$^{\textrm{2}}$). Twenty-seven studies (294 observations) were obtained and the sanitizers identified as controls were water and sodium hypochlorite. Summary effects of 0.66, 1.12, 1.15, 2.41, 4.45 and 5.34 log reductions were estimated for EO water treatments on poultry, fish, meats, lettuce, eggs and tomatoes, respectively. Highest reductions were estimated for smooth-surfaced foods (eggs, tomatoes) while pathogen reductions were lower on muscle foods. I$^{\textrm{2}}$ ranged between 60 and 99\%, indicating high heterogeneity and necessitating the use of meta-regressions to assess the variations. Free chlorine concentration (FCC), time and temperature were significant variables (p{\textless}0.05) in estimating EO water effectiveness, although no single variable was significant for all the products. The developed meta-regression models were applied to a selected treatment condition (30 mg/L FCC, 20 degrees C, 3 min) to attain 2.09, 5.27, 0.87 and 4.91 predicted log reductions on lettuce, tomatoes, meats and eggs, respectively. This analysis provides a precise estimate of the inactivation effect of EO water on different foods that can be applied in quantitative risk assessments for ensuring food safety.},

	abstract = {Lameness is a serious concern in the dairy sector, reflecting its high incidence and impact on animal welfare and productivity. Research has provided figures on its frequency using different methodologies, making it difficult to compare results and hindering farm-level decision-making. The study's objectives were to determine the frequency levels of lameness in British dairy cattle through a meta-analysis approach, and to understand the chronological patterns of how lameness cases are detected and classified in scientific research. A systematic review was conducted using PRISMA-P guidelines for article selection. Random-effects models estimated the pooled frequency measure of lameness with heterogeneity managed through subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Sixty-eight papers were identified, 50 included prevalence and 36 incidence data. The pooled prevalence of lameness in British dairy cattle was estimated at 29.5\% (95\% CI 26.7-32.4\%) whilst all-cause lameness incidence rate indicated 30.9 cases of lameness per 100 cow-years (95\% CI 24.5-37.9). The pooled cause-specific lameness incidence rate per 100 cow-years was 66.1 (95\% CI 24.1-128.8) for white line disease, 53.2 (95\% CI 20.5-101.2) for sole ulcer, 53.6 (95\% CI 19.2-105.34) for digital dermatitis, with 51.9 (95\% CI 9.3-129.2) attributable to other lameness-related lesions. Heterogeneity levels remained high. Sixty-nine papers contributed to a chronological overview of lameness data source. Although the AHDB Dairy mobility scoring system (MSS) was launched in the UK in 2008 and adopted shortly after by the British Dairy sector as the standard tool for assessing lameness, other methods are used depending on the investigator. Automated lameness detection systems may offer a solution for the subjective nature of MSSs, yet it was utilized in one study only. Despite the recognition of under-reporting of lameness from farm records 22 (31.9\%) studies used this data source. The diversity of lameness data collection methods and sources was a key finding. It limits the understanding of lameness burden and the refinement of policy making for lameness. Standardizing case definition and research methods would improve knowledge of and ability to manage lameness. Regardless of the measurement method lameness in British dairy cattle is high.},

A systematic literature review was conducted to collate and describe the available dose-response studies for adenovirus vectored vaccines. Of 2787 papers identified by Medline search strategy, 35 were found to conform to pre-defined criteria. The majority of studies were in mice or humans and studied adenovirus serotype 5. Dose-response data were available for 12 different immunological responses. The majority of papers evaluated three dose levels, only two evaluated more than five dose levels. The most common dosing range was 10(7)-10(10) viral particles in mouse studies and 10(8)-10(11) viral particles in human studies. Data were available on adenovirus vaccine dose-response, primarily on adenovirus serotype 5 backbones and in mice and humans.

There are some evidences to suggest that Toxocara infection is a neglected risk factor for childhood asthma. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to further understanding of this relationship. Five databases include PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science (ISI), and Google scholar were searched (up to October 2017) to identify the relevant studies. We used random-effects meta-analysis model to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed with the Q-test and I(2) statistic. A total of 17 studies including 11 studies with case-control design (1139 patients and 1023 controls) and six studies with cross-sectional design (a total of 5469 participants, 872 asthmatics, and 4597 non-asthmatics children) met the eligibility criteria. An increased risk for asthma was observed in children with Toxocara infection seropositivity (OR, 1.91; 95\% CI, 1.47-2.47). In sub-group analysis, the pooled ORs were (OR, 2.13; 95\% CI, 1.43-3.15) and (OR, 1.73; 95\% CI, 1.23-2.44) for case-control and cross-sectional studies, respectively. Moreover, considering to specific IgE seropositivity, a pooled OR of 2.36 (95\% CI, 0.93-5.98) was observed. In conclusion, this meta-analysis revealed that children infected with Toxocara spp. are more likely to have asthma compared to non-infected children. More studies (especially longitudinal studies) are needed to further investigate the impact of Toxocara spp. infection on the onset or development of asthma.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12910-021-00580-z},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of great apes (GA) in invasive biomedical research is one of the most debated topics in animal ethics. GA are, thus far, the only animal group that has frequently been banned from invasive research; yet some believe that these bans could inaugurate a broader trend towards greater restrictions on the use of primates and other animals in research. Despite ongoing academic and policy debate on this issue, there is no comprehensive overview of the reasons advanced for or against restricting invasive research with GA. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review of the reasons reported in the academic literature on this topic. METHODS: Seven databases were searched for articles published in English. Two authors screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts of all articles. Two journals specialized in animal ethics, and the reference lists of included articles were subsequently also reviewed. RESULTS: We included 60 articles, most of which were published between 2006 and 2016. Twenty-five articles argued for a total ban of GA research, 21 articles defended partial restrictions, and 14 articles argued against restrictions. Overall, we identified 110 reason types, 74 for, and 36 against, restricting GA research. Reasons were grouped into nine domains: moral standing, science, welfare, public and expert attitudes, retirement and conservation, respect and rights, financial costs, law and legal status, and longer-term consequences. CONCLUSION: Our review generated five main findings. First, there is a trend in the academic debate in favor of restricting GA research that parallels worldwide policy changes in the same direction. Second, in several domains (e.g., moral standing, and respect and rights), the reasons were rather one-sided in favor of restrictions. Third, some prominent domains (e.g., science and welfare) featured considerable engagement between opposing positions. Fourth, there is low diversity and independence among authors, including frequent potential conflicts of interests in articles defending a strong position (i.e., favoring a total ban or arguing against restrictions). Fifth, scholarly discussion was not the norm, as reflected in a high proportion of non-peer-reviewed articles and authors affiliated to non-academic institutions.},

	doi = {10.1186/s13071-019-3597-2},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oestrosis, caused by the larvae of Oestrus ovis, commonly known as sheep nose bot, is an obligatory cavitary myiasis of sheep and goats. Oestrus ovis is a widespread parasite, but little is known about the prevalence of oestrosis at the global and broad geographical levels. The present study aimed to explore the epidemiology of oestrosis at the global and regional level to estimate prevalences and their associated factors using a systematic approach. This is, to the author's knowledge, the first meta-analysis of oestrosis in sheep and goats. METHODS: Published articles were obtained from nine electronic databases (PubMed, CAB Abstracts, Web of Science, Scopus, UCB library, Medline, Biosis Citation Index, Indian journals and Google Scholar) reporting the prevalence of O. ovis in sheep and goats from 1970 to 2018. Pooled prevalences were estimated using a random effect meta-analysis model. RESULTS: Sixty-six studies were eligible, and data from 40,870 sheep and 18,216 goats were used for quantitative analysis. The random effect estimated prevalence of oestrosis at the global level in sheep was 51.15\% (95\% CI: 42.80-59.51\%) and in goats was 42.19\% (95\% CI: 33.43-50.95\%). The pooled prevalence estimates for Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas were 47.85\% (95\% CI: 36.04-59.66\%), 44.48\% (95\% CI: 33.09-55.87\%), 56.83\% (95\% CI: 48.92-64.74\%) and 34.46\% (95\% CI: 19.90-49.01\%), respectively. Heterogeneity (I(2) {\textgreater} 80\%) was detected in most pooled estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Oestrosis is highly prevalent in many geographical regions of the world, especially in Europe and Africa. Factors that contribute to the pooled prevalence estimate of oestrosis need to be emphasised in any survey to estimate the true prevalence of oestrosis. Furthermore, there is a need for immunisation or implementation of other preventive measures to reduce the burden of oestrosis in sheep and goats and to improve the health and welfare status.},

Despite the substantial economic consequences related to PPR, little is known about the prevalence of this disease at the broad geographical levels. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to use a systematic approach to assess the regional prevalence of PPR in sheep and goats, and the associated factors that contribute to prevalence estimates. METHODS: Published articles on PPR in sheep and goats were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar and the reference lists of articles reporting the prevalence from 1 January 1969 to 31 December 2018. Articles were selected using inclusion and exclusion criteria. Since the heterogeneity among the studies was significant, pooled prevalences were estimated by a random effect meta-analysis model. RESULTS: Data on the prevalence of PPR were obtained from Africa and Asia, where the pooled prevalence estimates were 40.99\% (95\% CI: 37.20\%-44.79\%) and 38.43\% (95\% CI: 35.64\%-41.22\%) respectively. Overall, the estimated pooled prevalence at Africa-Asia level in sheep was 39.31\% (95\% CI: 35.75\%-42.88\%) and in goats was 39.57\% (95\% CI: 36.66\%-42.48\%). Significant heterogeneity (I(2)  {\textgreater} 80\%) was noted in most pooled estimates. CONCLUSION: The results on the regional prevalence estimates of PPR presented here will be useful in raising awareness and advocating for Governments to engage in initiatives to eradicate PPR and prevent it from spreading to other continents.},

	abstract = {Contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) is a highly contagious respiratory disease of small ruminants that is caused by the bacterium Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae. Sheep and goats are two of the species of small ruminants most at risk of CCPP. Outbreaks of CCPP cause significant economic and trade disturbances in several parts of the world. However, the extent and magnitude of CCPP in a particular geographical region is still not well known due to lack of comprehensive data on its occurrence. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of CCPP in sheep and goats raised in different geographical regions as well as the factors contributing to the spread of the disease. Searches were done in five online repositories: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CAB Direct and Google Scholar using pre-selected key terms. Data were retrieved from the 41 articles that met the study's inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalences were determined using a random effect meta-analysis model. Prevalence of CCPP was 23.19\% (95\% CI: 11.90-34.47\%) in sheep and 24.91\% (95\% CI: 20.99-28.84\%) in goats. Overall, the regional level pooled prevalence estimates ranged from 8.0\% (95\% CI: 6.91-9.09\%) to 28.70\% (22.02-35.38\%), depending on species and world region. Substantial heterogeneity (I(2)  {\textgreater} 75\%) was observed in most pooled prevalence estimates. The results indicate high prevalences of CCPP in sheep and goats across the regions, particularly in Africa and Asia, and highlights the need to institute appropriate control measures. Active surveillance and research on risk factors are recommended.},

Over the last two decades, stem cells have generated great hopes for the treatment of numerous conditions including burns. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the role of stem cell therapy as a means to promote burn wound healing. METHODS: Comprehensive searches in major databases were carried out in March 2017 for articles on stem cell therapy in burn wound healing. In total 2103 articles were identified and screened on the basis of pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Fifteen experimental and two clinical studies were included in the review. The majority of studies reported significant improvement in macroscopic burn wound appearance as well as a trend toward improved microscopic appearance, after stem cell therapy. Other parameters evaluated, such as re-vascularization, collagen formation, level of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, apoptosis and cellular infiltrates, yielded heterogeneous results across studies. CONCLUSION: Stem cell therapy appears to exert a positive effect in burn wound healing. There is, therefore, justification for continued efforts to evaluate the use of stem cells as an adjunct to first-line therapies in burns.},

The overall pooled prevalence was calculated and subgroup analysis was performed on diagnostic methods, geographical distribution and study population. Meta-regression was performed on the year of publication, proportion of patients with diarrhea, and proportion of patients with CD4 {\textless} 200 cells/mL. One hundred and sixty-one studies and 51,123 HIV-positive participants were included. The overall pooled prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection in HIV-positive patients was 11.2\% (CI95\%: 9.4\%-13.0\%). The pooled prevalence was estimated to be 10.0\% (CI95\%: 8.4\%-11.8\%) using staining methods, 13.5\% (CI95\%: 8.9\%-19.8\%) using molecular methods, and 26.3\% (CI95\%: 15.0\%-42.0\%) using antigen detection methods. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium in HIV patients was significantly associated with the country of study. Also, there were statistical differences between the diarrhea, CD4 {\textless} 200 cells/mL, and antiretroviral therapy risk factors with Cryptosporidiosis. Thus, Cryptosporidium is a common infection in HIV-positive patients, and safe water and hand-hygiene should be implemented to prevent cryptosporidiosis occurrence in these patients.},

RESULTS: We identified 276 publications; of these publications, 18 met our inclusion criteria. In animal studies, stem cell therapy was applied more frequently for acute pancreatitis than for chronic pancreatitis. No clinical trials were identified. MSC therapy ameliorated pancreatic inflammation in acute pancreatitis and pancreatic fibrosis in chronic pancreatitis. Bone marrow and umbilical cord MSCs were the most frequently administered cell types. Due to the substantial heterogeneity among the studies regarding the type, source, and dose of MSCs used, conducting a meta-analysis was not feasible to determine the best type of MSCs. CONCLUSION: The available data were insufficient for determining the best type of MSCs for the treatment of acute or chronic pancreatitis; therefore, clinical trials investigating the use of MSCs as therapy for pancreatitis are not warranted.},

We estimated the effect size using standardized mean difference, and we evaluated the statistical heterogeneity of the effect size using Cochran's Q test, followed by meta-ANOVA and meta-regression analysis to explain the heterogeneity of the effect size using a mixed-effects model. We conducted Egger's linear regression test to evaluate publication bias. Among the factors evaluated, colon length and myeloperoxidase showed the greatest Q statistic and I(2) index, respectively. Colon length, transforming growth factor-β, IL-10, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione showed positive effect sizes in the fixed- and random-effects models. The others (spleen weight, tumor necrosis factor α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, IFN-γ, disease activity index, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, nitric oxide, myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde, histological score, and macroscopic inflammatory score) showed negative effect sizes in the fixed- and random-effects models. Probiotics showed a significant effect on all investigated factors, except IL-10. In meta-ANOVA and meta-regression analysis, Lactobacillus paracasei was the most effective probiotic for colon length. Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus fermentum, and a mixture of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Saccharomyces boulardii (LC + SB) were effective for colon length, tumor necrosis factor α, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, and disease activity index. Lactobacillus rhamnosus was most effective for IL-10 and IFN-γ. Dietary probiotics are effective in improving the symptoms of IBD. Although the results of this meta-analysis had some limitations due to a lack of animal experiments, they will be meaningful to people with IBD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that the amount of protein in the diet affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-testis axis and sub-optimal quantity reduces male fertility potential in both animals and humans. However, individual research reports on the factors associated with male infertility are collectively uncharacterized. AIM: We systematically reviewed, and meta-analysed animal (rats) studies on the effect of low protein diet on factors associated with male infertility. METHODS: PubMed Central, EMBASE and Scopus databases were searched from inception to 30 March 2019 for the study concepts and related keywords in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol. Data on the outcome measures were extracted and pooled across trials using random-effects model and expressed as mean differences (MD) at a 95\% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Twelve trials identified from 3327 studies, met our inclusion criteria in the comparison of a low protein diet (2-10\% protein) vs control protein diet (17-23\% protein). The results showed that a low protein diet caused a significant reduction in the body weight (P = 0.0001) testis weight (P = 0.0001), seminal vesicle weight (P = 0.0003), epididymis weight P = 0.02), serum testosterone (P = 0.001) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations (P = 0.04) compared with the control treatments. No effect on luteinizing hormone (LH) plasma concentration (P = 0.13) was observed. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that low protein diet caused significant reductions in body weight, testis, epididymis and seminal vesicle weights, serum testosterone and FSH concentration in rats. We infer that sub-optimal protein consumption reduces the gonadal and endocrine function, and consequently male infertility.},

	abstract = {Research indicates that some adult diseases including reproductive pathologies are programmed in utero during foetal development. In particular, maternal low dietary protein, during the most critical developmental periods of male foetal development, may have a detrimental impact on male fertility through direct and epigenetic mechanisms. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of a gestational low protein diet on fertility markers in male offspring in rats through a systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic search using PubMed, and EMBASE databases was performed and two investigators independently screened the 1,703 prospective articles. Eleven articles met the eligibility criteria. Outcome measures were pooled using random-effects models and expressed as mean differences (MDs) at 95\% CIs for each study. The results reveal significant reduction in testis weight (MD (mean difference) -0.08 g; -0.12, -0.42; p = .0001), epididymal sperm count (MD -35.34 × 10(6) cells; -52.15, -18.53; p = .0001), number of Sertoli cells (MD -7.27 × 10(6) (-13.92, -0.62; p = .03), testosterone (T) concentration (MD -0.29 ng/ml; -0.48, -0.09; p = .004) and luteinising hormone (LH) concentration (MD of -0.24 ng/ml; -0.45, 0.04; p = .02) in comparison with controls. In contrast, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration (MD of 0.07 ng/ml; -0.16, 0.29; p = .56) was not significantly different from controls. We conclude that low gestational dietary protein maternal intake potentially negatively impacts fertility in male progeny later in life. The mechanisms of action responsible for these phenomena remain unclear.},

However, the effects of gestational dietary protein modification on reproductive outcomes at birth are less clear. We, therefore, conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials to determine whether high- or low-protein diets are associated with altered reproductive outcomes in a commonly studied species, the rat. Included studies were identified through a systematic search using electronic databases and manual literature review to identify randomized studies published between June 1972 and March 2019. Thirty-two studies were identified and used to analyze the effects of low- and high-protein gestational diets on litter size, litter weight, gestational weight gain, and gestational feed intake. The results indicate that low-protein diets significantly reduced litter weight (P {\textless} 0.00001) and gestational weight gain (P {\textless} 0.0006), but did not influence litter size (P = 0.62) or gestational feed intake (P = 0.25). In contrast, high-protein diets were found to reduce gestational feed intake (P = 0.004) but did not influence litter size (P = 0.56), litter weight (P = 0.22), or gestational weight gain (P = 0.35).

METHODS: A literature search was conducted on PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, and Google databases in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, using keywords to identify articles related to parietal complications of HD in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. The following keywords were used: HD, hydatid cyst, cystic echinococcosis, alveolar echinococcosis, abdominal HD, thoracic HD, parietal complication, cutaneous fistulization, cystocutaneous fistulization, cutaneous involvement, external rupture, external fistulization, subcutaneous involvement, and subcutaneous abscess. The language of publication, journal, or country was not included as limitation criteria, and publications dated before August 1, 2016, were considered. Articles or abstracts containing adequate information, such as age, sex, cyst size, cyst location, clinical presentation, fistula opening location, and management were included in the study, whereas articles with insufficient clinical and demographic data were excluded. RESULTS: The literature review included 52 articles involving 55 patients with parietal complications of HD. Thirty-two articles were written in English, 15 in French, 2 in Spanish, 1 in Italian, 1 in German and 1 in Russian. All 55 patients (women, 30; men, 23; unknown, 2) involved in the study were aged 7 to 93 (mean ± standard deviation, 54.5 ± 20.2) years. A total of 24 patients had cysto-cutaneous fistula (Echinococcus granulosus), 12 had subcutaneous rupture, 10 had cutaneous fistula (E multilocularis), 3 had cystosubcutaneous abscess, 3 had cysto-cutaneo-bronchial fistula, 2 had cysto-cutaneo-bronchio-biliary fistula, and 1 had cutaneo-bronchial fistula. E granulosus were detected in 43 and E multilocularis in 12 patients through clinical, radiological, or histopathological examinations. CONCLUSION: Parietal complications such as cysto-cutaneous fistulization are a rare complication of HD. Complicated HD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with cutaneous involvement, especially in HD endemic regions.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.wasman.2019.03.054},
	abstract = {The animal production industry in the United States is currently undergoing a phase of growth; however, such growth brings certain challenges. One of the most prominent concerns in this regard is the increasing amounts of animal waste produced as a natural consequence of stock population growth. For decades, composting, including that of manure and animal mortalities, has been utilized to manage animal waste. Recently, in an effort to enhance the composting process, biochar has been proposed for use as a compost amendment, and over the last few years, an increasing number of papers on composting with biochar have been published. However, although there have been a few review papers that have summarized the literature regarding biochar use in composting, none of these has focused on animal waste composting. Accordingly, the purpose of this review is to critically analyze the role of biochar in livestock and poultry waste composting, identify gaps in our current knowledge, and propose future research directions. On the basis of the studies analyzed, biochar has the potential to improve animal waste composting processes at application rates of 5-10\%. Biochar can extend the thermophilic phase of the composting process, lower the pH of compost material, prevent leachate formation, and reduce ammonia, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions. Given that the feedstock used to produce biochar and the pyrolysis conditions employed in its production affect the performance of biochar, it is important to report the physicochemical properties of the biochars used to enable comparison of the results of different studies. Moreover, there is a need for further research to gain a better understanding of the impact of biochar regarding the elimination of antibiotic-resistant genes and animal mortality composting.},

We quantified the overall regional and country-specific Salmonella prevalence in different human populations and identified the most common serotypes. Published literature of Salmonella prevalence was systematically reviewed and reported following the Preferred Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Pooled Salmonella prevalence measures were estimated using a random-effects model. We identified 46 research reports that reported 84 Salmonella prevalence measures in 15 out of 24 countries in MENA. There were 252,831 tested humans with 6,356 Salmonella-positive cases. The pooled Salmonella prevalence in MENA was estimated at 6.6\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 5.4\%-7.9\%). The highest pooled Salmonella prevalence measures were in Morocco (17.9\%, 95\% CI: 5.7\%-34.8\%, 1997-2012), Tunisia (10.2\%, 95\% CI: 4.3\%-18.0\%, 1988-2009) and Sudan (9.2\%, 95\% CI: 6.5\%-12.2\%, 2006-2008), while the lowest were in Jordan (1.1\%, 95\% CI: 0.1\%-3.0\%, 1993-2010), Oman (1.2\%, 95\% CI: 1.2\%-1.3\%, 1998-2002) and Palestine (1.2\%, 95\% CI: 0.4\%-2.1\%, 1999-2011). In MENA, Salmonella pooled prevalence in gastrointestinal symptomatic, gastrointestinal asymptomatic and food handlers population groups was 13.0\% (95\% CI: 7.6\%-19.6\%), 11.4\% (95\% CI: 2.2\%-25.7\%) and 3.8\% (95\% CI: 1.0\%-8.0\%), respectively.

Salmonella Enteritidis (29.8\%) and Typhimurium (23.6\%) were the most common serotypes. Salmonella was a common foodborne pathogen in MENA countries, particularly in North African countries. Findings inform the scientific community, the public and the decision-makers with Salmonella prevalence and gaps in evidence in MENA to support control and prevention strategies and could leverage more research studies.},

Previous work by our group examined the association of snakebite and acute myocardial infarction. In this systematic review we aim to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of acute cerebrovascular accidents that are reported to be extremely rare complications of snake envenomation. METHODS: We performed a literature search for reports on stroke associated with snake envenomation between Jan 1995 to Oct 2018, and summarized their characteristics. RESULTS: Eighty-three published cases were reviewed. 66.3\% of the cases were younger than 50 years of age. The mean time for the onset of the symptoms is 23.8±10.9 hours after exposure. 77.1\% of the cases found to have ischemic stroke, 20.5\% with intra-cranial hemorrhage and both infarction and hemorrhage in 2.4\%. Mortality was reported in 16.9\% with mean time between onset of the symptoms and death is 4.2 days. CONCLUSION: Stroke secondary to snake envenomation is a rare but serious complication. Once stroke is suspected, initiating appropriate management is crucial in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with this potentially fatal complication of snake envenomation.},

	abstract = {The aims of this study were to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of the types of probiotic formulations that are commercially available and to critically appraise the available evidence for the effectiveness of probiotics in improving the health and productivity of calves. Relevant papers were identified to answer the question: 'In calves aged between birth to one year, is the use of probiotics associated with changes in haematological or biochemical parameters, faecal bacteria counts, average daily live weight gain, dry matter intake, or feed conversion ratio?' The search of the literature yielded 67 studies that fit the primary screening criteria. Included studies were assessed for bias and confounding using a predefined risk assessment tool adapted from the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials and GRADE guidelines. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager and R. Random sequence generation was low in more than 59 \% of studies. Risk of allocation concealment and performance bias were largely unclear in over 68 \% of studies. Calves fed probiotics had increased average daily live weight gains (ADG) from birth to weaning (mean difference [MD] = 83.14 g/d 95 \% CI = 58.36-107.91, P {\textless} 0.001) compared with calves on a control diet. Calf age reduced the level of heterogeneity of the effect of probiotics on ADG for calves between one to three weeks of age (τ(2) = 73.15; I(2) = 4\%; P = 0.40) but not for calves older than three weeks of age (τ(2) = 2892.91; I(2) = 73 \%; P {\textless} 0.001). Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was lower for calves on probiotics (MD = -0.13 kg of dry matter intake (DMI) to kg of live weight (LW) gain, 95 \% CI = -0.17 to -0.09, P {\textless} 0.001), and the heterogeneity of effect was large in younger aged calves (τ(2) = 0.05; I(2) = 78 \%; P = 0.03). The risk of bias regarding the methodology in the included studies was high. The quality of evidence for each outcome was categorised as moderate. There is sufficient data to support the effectiveness of probiotic use in some applications such as for the improvement of performance and productivity parameters of calves. However, the evidence is weak for other potential probiotic uses in calves such as improved health and reduced risk of disease. Therefore, the existing data are inconclusive and do not support the use of probiotics as an alternative to antimicrobials to improve calf health and productivity.},

Literature was collated via retrieved information from online databases, viz, PubMed, MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Besides improved immunomodulation and nutrient digestibility, in-feed probiotics have shown drastic reductions in gastrointestinal tract-invading pathogens. However, every novel probiotic strain cannot be assumed to share historical safety with conventional strains. Any strain not belonging to the wild-type distributions of relevant antimicrobials, or found to be harbouring virulence determinants, should not be developed further. Modes of identification and the transmigration potential of the strains across the gastrointestinal barrier must be scrutinized. Other potential risk factors include the possibility of promoting deleterious metabolic effects, excessive immune stimulation and genetic stability of the strains over time. Adverse effects of probiotics could be strain specific, depending on the prevailing immunological and physiological condition of the host. The most crucial concern is the stability of the strain. Probiotics stand a good chance of replacing antibiotics in animal husbandry. The possibility of the probiotics used in animal feed cross-contaminating the human food chain cannot be downplayed. Thus, the established safety measures in probiotic development must be adhered to for a successful global campaign on food safety and security.},

METHODS: Systematic search was done using PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE and ProQuest databases. Quantitative analysis of alveolar bone loss, with subcategories for the experimental periods studied, was performed. The analysis was performed through the mean difference (MD), with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) and according to SYRCLE guidelines. RESULTS: Nine studies were considered eligible. A statistically favorable difference was observed for the use of aPDT in all periods studied in systemically healthy animals at 7 (P {\textless} 0.00001; MD: -0.71; 95\% CI: [-0.85, -0.58]; I2: 90\%), 15 (P {\textless} 0.00001; MD: -0.49; 95\% CI: [-0.62, -0.37]; I2: 88\%), and 30 (P {\textless} 0.00001; MD: -0.53; 95\% CI: [-0.65, -0.41]; I2: 80\%) days postoperatively. The difference was also observed for modified animals at 7 (P {\textless} 0.00001; MD: -1.03; 95\% CI: [-1.43, -0.62]; I2: 97\%), 15 (P {\textless} 0.00001; MD: -1.04; 95\% CI: [-1.62, -0.46]; I2: 99\%), and 30 (P {\textless} 0.00001; MD: -0.88; 95\% CI: [-1.37, -0.39]; I2: 97\%) days postoperatively. CONCLUSION: The adjunctive use of aPDT favored the reduction of alveolar bone loss in experimental periodontitis in rats, and this result was more evident in systemically compromised rats.},

Whereas some studies found significant positive effect of cow's milk on exercise performance and recovery of muscle function, others did not find any effect. These controversies could be due to the heterogeneity of cow's milk ingestion (e.g., amount of cow's milk, timing of consuming the cow's milk), to the type of intervention, and to the large heterogeneity of outcomes measured. Limited studies exist examining the effects of cow's milk consumption and its influence on exercise performance and recovery of muscle function, therefore further studies are needed to draw more definitive conclusions.},

In this review, 108 studies from 2013 to 2018 were considered to determine the quality of adherence to the ARRIVE guidelines in the reports of the methodologies. The majority of the studies lacked the details recommended in the ARRIVE guidelines regarding data directly related to the welfare of animals undergoing surgery and those about anesthetic protocols and analgesics. Information related to sample size calculation and housing and husbandry conditions was also very limited. We believe that the ARRIVE guidelines are an excellent tool for good-quality reporting.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis and intestinal parasites are mostly affecting poor people. They are in a vicious since one is the risk factor for the other. However, the comprehensive report on the burden and co-incidence of intestinal parasites and tuberculosis in Ethiopia is scant. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to provide abridge conclusive evidence on the intestinal parasite-tuberculosis co-infection in Ethiopia. METHODS: A total of 414 articles published in English were searched from both electronic databases (CINAHL, DOAJ, Embase, Emcare, Medline, ProQuest, and PubMed, Science Direct, and Web of Science) and other sources. The qualities of the included studies were assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools and the publication bias was measured using the funnel plot and Eggers regression test. Comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) Version 3.3.07 and Review Manager software were used to estimate pooled prevalence and associations of intestinal parasites and tuberculosis infection. RESULTS: Eleven articles with a total of 3158 tuberculosis patients included in the analysis based on the eligibility criteria. The estimated pooled prevalence of intestinal parasites co-infection was 33\% (95\% CI: 23.3, 44.3) using the random-effects model. The most common intestinal parasites were Ascaris lumbricoides 10.5\% (95\% CI: 6.0, 17.5), Hookworm 9.5\% (95\% CI: 6.10, 14.4), Giardia lamblia 5.7\% (95\% CI: 2.90, 10.9) and Strongyloides sterocoralis 5.6\% (95\% CI: 3.3, 9.5). The odds of intestinal parasites infection was higher among tuberculosis patients compared to tuberculosis free individuals (OR = 1.76; 95\% CI: 1.17, 2.63). A significant difference was observed among TB patients for infection with intestinal helminths (OR = 2.01; 95\% CI: 1.07, 3.80) but not for intestinal protozoans when compared with their counterparts. The odds of multiple parasitic infections was higher among tuberculosis patients (OR = 2.59, 95\% CI: 1.90, 3.55) compared to tuberculosis free individuals. However, intestinal parasites co-infection was not associated with HIV status among tuberculosis patients (OR = 0.97; 95\% CI: 0.71, 1.32). CONCLUSION: One-third of tuberculosis patients are co-infected with one or more intestinal parasites, and they are more likely to be infected with intestinal helminths and multiple intestinal parasitic infections compared to TB free individuals. We recommend routine screening of tuberculosis patients for intestinal parasites. The effect of mass deworming on tuberculosis incidence would be important to be considered in future researches.

	abstract = {Cancer is an increasingly frequent malignancy worldwide, and despite the advances in drug development, it is still necessary to develop new plant-derived medicines. Euterpe oleracea (acai) is abundant in South and Central America and has health benefits due to its high levels of phytochemicals, including lignans and polyphenols. The aim of this review was to systematically describe the safety and antitumor effects of acai in preclinical models using rodents to provide a more comprehensive assessment of acai for both therapeutic uses and the development of future clinical studies in cancer. Eligible studies were identified using four international databases (PubMed, Medline, Lilacs and SciELO) from their inception date through December 2017. The included studies were analyzed with methodological rigor (QATRS) to enable better quality control for these experimental studies. Sixty publications were identified in the databases, but only 9 articles were eligible: 6 evaluated the pharmacological effects of acai in animal models of cancer (1 model each of esophageal cancer, urothelial cancer, melanoma and Walker-256 tumor and 2 models of colon cancer), and 3 were toxicological assays using preclinical models with rodents. Overall, 747 animals were analyzed. On a QATRS score scale of 0-20, the quality of the studies ranged from 16 to 20 points. Pulp was the main fraction of acai administered, and an oral administration route was most common. The acai dosage administered by gavage ranged from 30 mg/kg to 40,000 mg/kg, and acai fed in the diet accounted for 2.5\% to 5\% of the diet. The anticarcinogenic and chemopreventive activities of acai were observed in all experimental models of cancer and reduced the incidence, tumor cell proliferation, multiplicity and size of the tumors due to the antiinflammatory, antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties of acai. No genotoxic effects were observed after acai administration. The results of this review suggest that acai is safe and can be used as a chemoprotective agent against cancer development. Acai therapy may be a novel strategy for treating cancer.},

The database consisted of 40 experiments with 159 treatments, involving 735 lactating cows.

The relation of the non-fibrous carbohydrate (NFC) content of the diet with the lactose content and the effect of the DM diet content and the high NDF content on the voluntary intake are specific characteristics of the types of roughage used. Dietary NDT intake is affected by the digestibility of DM and, mainly, NDF, depending on the proportion and characteristics of the nutrients used in the diet, and these factors have an impact on dietary efficiency, as well as on milk composition.},

Lactating dairy cow diets with a single source of roughage other than corn silage resulted in lower voluntary intake, milk yield, and differences in milk composition, compared to diets based on corn silage or the combination of two roughages, probably due to reduced nutrient digestibility. Diets based on corn silage are distinguished by feed efficiency, milk yield, and composition. Diets based on the combination of two roughage sources are similar with respect to milk yield and composition, compared to diets based on corn silage; whereas, diets with a single source of roughage (other than corn silage), even when containing a higher proportion of concentrate, led to reduced voluntary intake, milk yield, and food efficiency due to the lower utilization of the nutrients.

Using a meta-analysis, we evaluated the effects of dietary roughage sources on the composition, voluntary intake, and digestibility of diets fed to crossbred Holstein x Zebu cows under experimental feeding conditions in Brazil. Finally, we assessed the effects of dietary roughage sources on milk yield and composition. The database was composed of 43 experiments with 183 treatments, including 943 lactating cows. The data were obtained from studies published between January 2000 and December 2015. The data were evaluated by analysis of variance, considering the distribution of variables. The diets differed in dry matter and crude protein (CP) contents according to the roughage sources. Diets based on corn silage demonstrated higher intakes of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), CP, and total digestible nutrients, which improved the digestibility of NDF and CP, and resulted in a higher milk yield compared to the diets with one roughage source or those with a combination of two roughage sources.

	abstract = {It is well-known that positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can prevent ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and improve pulmonary physiology in animals with injured lungs. It's uncertain whether PEEP has similar effects in animals with uninjured lungs. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different PEEP levels in animals with uninjured lungs was performed. Trials in animals with injured lungs were excluded, as were trials that compared ventilation strategies that also differed with respect to other ventilation settings, e.g., tidal volume size. The search identified ten eligible trials in 284 animals, including rodents and small as well as large mammals. Duration of ventilation was highly variable, from 1 to 6 hours and tidal volume size varied from 7 to 60 mL/kg. PEEP ranged from 3 to 20 cmH(2)O, and from 0 to 5 cmH(2)O, in the 'high PEEP' or 'PEEP' arms, and in the 'low PEEP' or 'no PEEP' arms, respectively. Definitions used for lung injury were quite diverse, as were other outcome measures. The effects of PEEP, at any level, on lung injury was not straightforward, with some trials showing less injury with 'high PEEP' or 'PEEP' and other trials showing no benefit. In most trials, 'high PEEP' or 'PEEP' was associated with improved respiratory system compliance, and better oxygen parameters. However, 'high PEEP' or 'PEEP' was also associated with occurrence of hypotension, a reduction in cardiac output, or development of hyperlactatemia. There were no differences in mortality. The number of trials comparing 'high PEEP' or 'PEEP' with 'low PEEP' or 'no PEEP' in animals with uninjured lungs is limited, and results are difficult to compare. Based on findings of this systematic review it's uncertain whether PEEP, at any level, truly prevents lung injury, while most trials suggest potential harmful effects on the systemic circulation.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To provide a systematic review of the literature on the disorders and management of the lacrimal drainage system (LDS) in few of the species of the animal kingdom. METHODS: The authors performed a PubMed search of all articles that were published in English with specific reference to lacrimal drainage disorders in animals. Data captured include demographics, presentations, investigation, diagnoses and management modalities. Emphasis was also on anatomical differences, evolutionary perspectives and addressing the lacunae and potential directions for future research. RESULTS: The lacrimal drainage system is a terrestrial adaptation in vertebrates. Evolutionary development of the LDS is closely linked to the Harderian gland and the vomeronasal organ. Variable differences in the clinical presentations and management of lacrimal drainage disorders (LDD) are noted in comparison to humans. These are secondary to unique structural and pathophysiological differences. Uniformity in usage and reporting of disease terminologies is required. Diagnostic challenges in clinical examination can be met with the development of customized lacrimal instruments. Contrast dacryocystorhinography is a very useful investigation in the diagnosis of LDD. Multiple bypass procedures like conjunctivorhinostomy, conjunctivobuccostomy and conjunctivomaxillosinosotomy have been described for nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO). Advances of endoscopy and radiological techniques are paralleled by minimally invasive lacrimal interventions. The search for an ideal animal model for human LDS is far from over and the choice of the animal needs to be customized based on the research objectives. CONCLUSION: The lacrimal drainage system is an ancestral feature in tetrapod vertebrates and it is present, in some form or another, in most descendant species. The lacrimal drainage system has evolved considerably, adapting to the needs of the species. It is essential to understand the lacrimal drainage disorders of domestic animals so that the animal and human lacrimal sciences contribute more meaningfully to each other.},

	abstract = {Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonotic helminthiasis caused by different species of the genus Echinococcus, and is a major economic and public health concern worldwide. Synthetic anthelmintics are most commonly used to control CE, however, prolonged use of these drugs may result in many adverse effects. This study aims to discuss the in vitro/in vivo scolicidal efficacy of different medicinal plants and their components used against Echinococcus granulosus. Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, PubMed and Scopus were used to retrieve the published literature from 2000-2020. A total of 62 published articles met the eligibility criteria and were reviewed. A total of 52 plant species belonging to 22 families have been reported to be evaluated as scolicidal agents against E. granulosus worldwide. Most extensively used medicinal plants against E. granulosus belong to the family Lamiaceae (25.0\%) followed by Apiaceae (11.3\%). Among various plant parts, leaves (36.0\%) were most commonly used. Essential oils of Zataria multiflora and Ferula asafetida at a concentration of 0.02, and 0.06 mg/ml showed 100\% in vitro scolicidal activity after 10 min post application, respectively. Z. multiflora also depicted high in vivo efficacy by decreasing weight and size while also causing extensive damage to the germinal layer of the cysts. Plant-based compounds like berberine, thymol, and thymoquinone have shown high efficacy against E. granulosus. These plant species and compounds could be potentially used for the development of an effective drug against E. granulosus, if further investigated for in vivo efficacy, toxicity, and mechanism of drug action in future research.},

	abstract = {Addition of uric acid (UA) to thrombolytic therapy, although safe, showed limited efficacy in improving patients' stroke outcome, despite alleged neuroprotective effects of UA in preclinical research. This systematic review assessed the effects of UA on brain structural and functional outcomes in animal models of ischemic stroke. We searched Medline, Embase and Web of Science to identify 16 and 14 eligible rodent studies for qualitative and quantitative synthesis, respectively. Range of evidence met 10 of a possible 13 STAIR criteria. Median (Q1, Q3) quality score was 7.5 (6, 10) on the CAMARADES 15-item checklist. For each outcome, we used standardised mean difference (SMD) as effect size and random-effects modelling. Meta-analysis showed that UA significantly reduced infarct size (SMD: -1.18; 95\% CI [-1.47, -0.88]; p {\textless} 0.001), blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment/oedema (SMD: -0.72; 95\% CI [-0.97, -0.48]; p {\textless} 0.001) and neurofunctional deficit (SMD: -0.98; 95\% CI [-1.32, -0.63]; p {\textless} 0.001). Overall, there was low to moderate between-study heterogeneity and sizeable publication bias. In conclusion, published rodent data suggest that UA improves outcome following ischemic stroke by reducing infarct size, improving BBB integrity and ameliorating neurofunctional condition. Specific recommendations are given for further high-quality preclinical research required to better inform clinical research.},

	abstract = {Adults perpetrate the majority of animal abuse incidents yet clinicians are left with very little evidence base to advance/enhance their practice. The purpose of this systematic review is to synthesize and evaluate the current literature on adult-perpetrated animal abuse and to identify the etiological factors related to this type of offending. Twenty-three studies met the specific inclusion criteria but most importantly, they examined the characteristics of adult perpetrators of animal abuse. The findings from this review were demarcated by sample type: (1) Participants were the perpetrators of the animal abuse or held offense-supportive attitudes and (2) participants were victims of intimate partner violence reporting incidents of animal abuse perpetrated by their partner. From the perpetrator perspective, there were key developmental (i.e., maladaptive parenting strategies), behavioral (such as varied offending behaviors), and psychological (e.g., callousness, empathy deficits) factors highlighted in the literature. Finally, in the context of intimate partner violence, findings indicated that perpetrators abuse animals to control, coerce, intimidate, and/or manipulate their victims (this effect is moderated by the victims' emotional attachment to their pet). This review inherently underlines treatment targets that could achieve greater clinical gains, but we also conclude that more empirical and theoretical work is needed in order to set an agenda that prioritizes future research and effective practice.},

	abstract = {Cholesterol is a lipophilic component essential for the body due to its diverse functionalities, such as participation in vitamin D synthesis, metabolism of steroids and sex hormones, help in the absorption of fat soluble vitamins, besides participating in the maintenance of the fluidity and permeability of plasma membrane. This function is extremely important to regularize the action potential and the consequent synaptic plasticity. However, high cholesterol levels due to a hyperlipidemic diet or genetic dysfunction are related to various cardiovascular and metabolic pathologies, such as diabetes. In addition, elevated cholesterol levels participate in the pathophysiology of neuropathies, such as Alzheimer and Parkinson. Considering that some neuropathies have hippocampal alterations as one of the events, this study aimed to investigate the possible relationship between hypercholesterolemia, hippocampus and the pathophysiology of neurological disorders through a review of the literature using preclinical studies. During the month of February 2018, we searched the databases Pubmed and Lilacs, using "hypercholesterolemia" and "hippocampus". Inclusion criteria: Preclinical studies published between 2013 and 2017 were selected. Exclusion criteria: review articles, articles that did not correlate hypercholesterolemia with neurological disorders and hippocampus. Increased serum cholesterol was associated with biochemical changes, especially oxidative stress, inflammation and metabolism of the amyloid protein, as well as neurodegenerative processes at the hippocampus level. In addition, drugs that modulate serum cholesterol levels have also been found to influence cognition and hippocampal integrity. Preclinical studies indicate that the hippocampus was susceptible to hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, hypercholesterolemia may contribute to neurological disorders with hippocampal disorders.},

METHODS: A systematic review of literature of cases of congenital brucellosis was performed on October 10, 2017 (registered as PROSPERO CRD42017072061). RESULTS: A case seen by the authors was added to the review, yielding 44 reported cases of which 22 (50\%) were from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, or Kuwait. For cases with the gestational age reported, 23 of 37 (62\%) were preterm. The species was Brucella melitensis in 35 cases, Brucella abortus in 3 cases and not documented in 6 cases. The diagnosis was based on a positive blood culture from the first day of life in 20 cases (45\%). Presentation was usually typical for a bacteremic infant of that GA, but two infants were asymptomatic at diagnosis. There were two recurrences and seven deaths (six in preterm infants), but the role of Brucella infection in the deaths was not clear. CONCLUSION: Brucellosis remains a concern in endemic countries, adversely affecting pregnancy and very rarely causing neonatal infection. Prematurity appeared to be the prime cause of death in neonates with congenital brucellosis.},

	abstract = {Aliskiren is an oral antihypertensive medication that acts by directly inhibiting renin. High levels of circulating renin and prorenin activate the pathological signaling pathway of fibrosis. This drug also reduces oxidative stress. Thus, the aim of this systematic review is to analyze experimental studies that show the actions of aliskiren on fibrosis. PubMed and LILACS databases were consulted using the keywords aliskiren and fibrosis within the period between 2005 and 2017. Fifty-three articles were analyzed. In the heart, aliskiren attenuated remodeling, hypertrophy, inflammatory cytokines, collagen deposition, and oxidative stress. In the kidneys, there was a reduction in interstitial fibrosis, the infiltration of inflammatory cells, apoptosis, proteinuria, and in the recruitment of macrophages. In diabetic models, an improvement in the albumin/creatinine relationship and in the insulin pathway in skeletal muscles was observed; aliskiren was beneficial to pancreatic function and glucose tolerance. In the liver, aliskiren reduced fibrosis, steatosis, inflammatory cytokines, and collagen deposition. In the lung and peritoneal tissues, there was a reduction in fibrosis. Many studies have reported on the beneficial effects of aliskiren on endothelial function and arterial rigidity. A reduction in fibrosis in different organs is cited by many authors, which complies with the results found in this review. However, studies diverge on the use of the drug in diabetic patients. Aliskiren has antifibrotic potential in several experimental models, interfering with the levels of fibrogenic cytokines and oxidative stress. Therefore, its use in diseases in which fibrosis plays an important pathophysiological role is suggested.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The presence of infections is one of the main factors that leads to delays in healing or non-closure of cutaneous wounds. Although the goal of antibiotic use is to treat or prevent infection, there is currently no agreement on the effectiveness of these products. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of antibiotic use during the healing process of skin wounds in animal models not intentionally infected, as well as to analyze the advances and limitations of the studies carried out in this field. MAIN METHODS: This systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines, using a structured search on the MedLine (PubMed) and Scopus platforms to retrieve studies published until August 29, 2018, 13:35p.m. The studies included were limited to those that used excision or incision wound models and that were not intentionally infected. The data for the animal models, antibiotic used, and the main results of the studies were extracted, and compared where possible. Bias analysis and methodological quality assessments were examined through the SYRCLE's Risk of Bias tool. KEY FINDINGS: Twenty-seven studies were selected. Overall, the effects of the antibiotic on the wound decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and promoted an increased number of fibroblasts, extracellular matrix constituents, re-epithelialization and tissue strength. A great deal of important information about the methodology was not presented, such as: the statistical analysis used, the animal model (sex and age), antibiotic dosage, blinding and randomization of the animals chosen. SIGNIFICANCE: Based on the results found, we believe that antibiotic therapy can be considered a viable alternative for the treatment of cutaneous wounds. However, current evidence obtained from the methodological quality analysis points towards a high risk of bias. This is due to the incomplete characterization of the experimental design and treatment protocol, which compromises the reproducibility of the studies.},

This overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses aimed to examine the scientific literature available on the association between dairy product consumption and T2D risk. A literature search was conducted in the MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Central Database of Systematic Reviews, and Web of Science databases from their inception to April, 2018. Forest plots summarized the risk ratios (RRs) reported by meta-analyses on high compared with low and dose-response dairy product consumption. The risk of bias was assessed using the AMSTAR2 tool. We included 12 meta-analyses, reporting data from 4-22 cohort studies and from 4-23 populations. The participants' ages ranged from 20 to 88 y, and participants were followed up for from 4 to 30 y. Studies included 64,227-566,875 participants and reported 4810-44,474 cases of T2D. Most studies reported an inverse association between T2D incidence and dairy product consumption, especially for 1) total dairy products (range: 0.86-0.91), 2) low-fat dairy products (range: 0.81-0.83), 3) low-fat milk (RR: 0.82), and 4) yogurt (range: 0.74-0.86). Dose-response analyses showed a decreased T2D risk for 1) 200-400 g/d of total dairy products (range: 0.93-0.97) and 2) 200 g/d of low-fat dairy products (range: 0.88-0.91). Total dairy product consumption is associated with a lower risk of T2D, especially for yogurt and low-fat dairy consumption. The association with cheese is moderate. Moreover, dose-response analyses showed that the risk of T2D decreased by each unit increase in consumption of total dairy products and low-fat dairy products.},

Most of the related literature focuses on MS impact on offspring, however, it should ideally also consider the impact of altered maternal behaviour caused by MS itself. This systematic review aimed at providing a comprehensive compilation of the effects of MS on key maternal behaviour aspects. We performed a keyword literature search using Boolean operators. Databases were searched between 2000-2018. Additional studies were included from manual search. Twenty-nine articles addressing the impact of MS on maternal behaviour and/or mothers' anxiety, depression-like behaviour, memory and consequences on underlying mechanisms. The methodological aspects and main conclusions were extracted from each study. This review shows that MS induces changes in dams. Results are particularly robust for increased anxiety and depressive-like symptoms, and altered maternal behaviours, predominantly for longer periods of MS. Finally, research in the field could strongly benefit from the establishment of guidelines to reduce the methodological inconsistencies here identified.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Skin wounds are closely correlated with opportunistic infections and sepsis risk. Due to the need of more efficient healing drugs, animal peptides are emerging as new molecular platforms to accelerate skin wound closure and to prevent and control bacterial infection. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the preclinical evidence on the impact of animal peptides on skin wound healing. In addition, we carried out a critical analysis of the studies' methodological quality. Main Methods. This systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines, using a structured search on the PubMed-Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science platforms to retrieve studies published until August 25, 2020 at 3 : 00 pm. The studies included were limited to those that used animal models, investigated the effect of animal peptides with no association with other compounds on wound healing, and that were published in English. Bias analysis and methodological quality assessments were examined through the SYRCLE's RoB tool. RESULTS: Thirty studies were identified using the PRISMA workflow. In general, animal peptides were effective in accelerating skin wound healing, especially by increasing cellular proliferation, neoangiogenesis, colagenogenesis, and reepithelialization. Considering standardized methodological quality indicators, we identified a marked heterogeneity in research protocols and a high risk of bias associated with limited characterization of the experimental designs. CONCLUSION: Animal peptides show a remarkable healing potential with biotechnological relevance for regenerative medicine. However, rigorous experimental approaches are still required to clearly delimit the mechanisms underlying the healing effects and the risk-benefit ratio attributed to peptide-based treatments.},

From the PRISMA methodology, an initial search process was carried out on the OVIDR, SciELO Citation IndexR and RedalycRsearch platforms. Based on a research question, a search for relevant titles was carried out, considering only original articles and case reports published in indexed journals and under peer review processes. Subsequently, the reference lists of the definitive articles were searched for additional information (snowballing). Four articles were considered for the presentation of final results and discussion, all published in English, between 2002 and 2015. From the information collected from the four studies, it can be inferred that there are immunological variations in patients undergoing general anesthesia, finding differences in immune responses between total intravenous and inhaled anesthesia. Additionally, it is noteworthy the absence of experimental research that allows not only to analyze the differences between the types of anesthesia, but also between the different anesthetic protocols and patients with concomitant diseases.},

Recently, several animals' models' studies have been performed to investigate the therapeutic impact of irisin in several disorders. Several interventional trials used different doses. However, optimum dose was not determined. This systematic review aims to identify the optimal dose of interventional irisin in mice and rat animal models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Online databases PubMed, Google Scholar, and Springer were systematically searched from 2012 to 2019. The words searched were irisin, irisin and animal model, physical activity, and irisin and irisin dosage. Non-irisin doses, in vitro studies, and factors influencing irisin levels were excluded. RESULTS: Eleven of the total 391 qualifying studies were included. A daily injection of 500 μg/kg irisin may be the optimum dose of effect in mice and rats. CONCLUSION: More studies are required to determine the optimum dose of irisin to be used as a therapeutic intervention based on animal model.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Sri Lanka is endemic to cutaneous leishmaniasis and reported as the latest focus of leishmaniasis in the Asian subcontinent. Annually, the number of leishmaniasis cases is increasing; therefore, more efficient diagnostic tools, treatment methods and effective prevention measures are indispensable. For this reason, many studies were conducted regarding leishmaniasis infections in Sri Lanka; however, some areas need more attention. Thus, in this review, we comprehensively discussed the studies on leishmaniasis carried out in Sri Lanka. METHODS: Published articles on leishmaniasis in Sri Lanka were searched on PubMed, Google Scholar and ResearchGate databases. Inclusion criteria for the articles were based on keyword searches including 'Leishmaniasis in Sri Lanka', 'Leishmaniasis vector in Sri Lanka', 'Sandfly species in Sri Lanka', 'Leishmaniasis epidemiology in Sri Lanka' which are publicly accessible as of 15th July 2019. RESULTS: In this study, we evaluated and summarized the leishmaniasis reports in Sri Lanka and mainly focused on clinical presentation of leishmaniasis infection, genetic characteristics of Leishmania donovani Sri Lankan strain, geographical distribution and associated environmental factors, immunological aspects of the infection, vector, reservoir host, risk factors, diagnosis and treatment, and prevention and control. Furthermore, we identified the areas where further research is needed to fill the essential knowledge gaps. CONCLUSIONS: Leishmaniasis has become a critically important parasitic infection in Sri Lanka, whereas the significant clinical form is cutaneous leishmaniasis. Prevalence of the leishmaniasis infections is reported from all the districts of the country. Therefore, more studies are essential to be carried out to fill the existing knowledge gaps emphasized in this review.},

Consequently, back pain management is commonly limited to symptomatic treatment therapies. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review is to evaluate major progress and to unravel the biology and pathology of ID discogenic pain. METHODS: The design of this study is a systematic review. A literature search was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases, with no time constraints to locate relevant literature. Significant articles (literature reviews, therapeutic essays, clinical-human-research studies, animal research, and laboratory research) on the intervertebral disc were identified and reviewed. The exclusion criteria were the following: case reports and clinical studies with {\textless}10 patients. RESULTS: Through a dense review of the literature, the ID is deciphered and described as a fragile anatomic entity. For this systematic review, 132 studies were identified and 79 were retained. The main deterioration and alteration mechanisms that lead to the programmed death of the ID are summarized. In addition, the large variety of biological therapies that override surgical treatment are determined. CONCLUSIONS: The degeneration mechanisms of the ID are well defined and decrypted. Although therapies have progressed, none has been effective. The regeneration of the ID remains highly challenging because of the complexity of its natural composition, microstructure, and mechanical properties.},

We systematically reviewed the long-term effects of early macronutrient supplementation in preterm and SGA animals and whether these differ by sex. Using Cochrane Neonatal and SYRCLE methodologies we included random or quasi-random studies that allocated non-human mammals to macronutrient supplements or no supplements between birth and weaning and assessed post-weaning outcomes. We used random-effects models to calculate standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Six studies provided low to very-low-quality evidence that macronutrient supplementation increased weight in juvenile rats (SMD; 95\% CI: 2.13; 1.00, 3.25; 1 study, n = 24), increased leptin concentrations in older adults (1.31; 0.12, 2.51; 1 study, n = 14 male rats), but decreased leptin concentrations in young adults (-1.13; -2.21, -0.05; 1 study, n = 16 female rats) and improved spatial learning and memory (qualitative data; 1 study). There was no evidence of sex-specific effects and no overall effect on length, serum lipids, body composition, HOMA-IR, or blood pressure. Macronutrient supplements may affect later growth, metabolism, and neurodevelopment of preterm and SGA animals, but evidence is limited and low quality.},

	abstract = {The World Health Organization has reported an annual global suicide rate of 14.5 per 100,000 people. On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately one-third of the global population are infected with Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) parasite. It is widely assumed that microbial pathogens, such as T. gondii, are probably associated with affective and behavioural modulation. The present article aimed to assess the proposed role of toxoplasmosis in raising the risk of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA) using the available epidemiological data. Seven major electronic databases and the Internet search engine Google were searched for all the studies published between the 1st of January 1950 and 31st of October 2019. The heterogeneity and the risk of bias within and across studies were assessed. Following data extraction, pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence interval (CI) across studies were calculated using the random-effects models. A total number of 9,696 articles were screened and 27 studies were regarded as eligible in our systematic review (SI with five papers and 22 papers on SA). A significant association was detected between antibodies against T. gondii with TA (ORs = 1.57; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-2.00, p = .000). Exploration of the association between T. gondii and SA yielded a positive effect of seropositivity for IgG antibodies but not IgM. Despite the limited number of studies, a statistical association was detected between suicidal behaviours and infection with latent T. gondii.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is well known for its ability to virtually infect all warm-blooded vertebrates. Although felines as the definitive hosts have an important role in the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis, there are few descriptions of genetic diversity in the world. The present review study aimed to describe the population structure of T. gondii in these animal species. For the purpose of the study, five English language databases reporting data on T. gondii genotyping in cats were searched within March-June 2019. This study is registered on the site of CAMARADES-NC3Rs (15-Jan-2018). The searching process resulted in the inclusion of 50 reports published from 1992 to June 2019. The data revealed that 47,390 samples were genotyped into 662 T. gondii DNA/isolates. Globally, atypical genotypes were predominant (47.7\%, n = 316); in addition, Type II clonal strains were the second most common genotype (37\%, n = 244). These results suggested an epidemic population structure in America and Asia, and a clonal population structure in Europe and Africa. Genotype \#3 was found to be dominant in Africa, Europe and Oceania continents. Furthermore, genotypes \#9 and \#5 were prevalent in Asia and America, respectively. Additionally, genotypes \#2, \#3, \#5 and \#20 were common genotypes in domestic and sylvatic cycles from family Felidae. Collectively, this systematic review indicated a large degree of genetic diversity and circulation of mouse-virulent T. gondii strains in this family. However, further studies are necessary to better understand the population structure of T. gondii in these animal species and determine the significance of their features.},

	abstract = {Osteoarthritis is a common clinical and pathological end-point from a range of joint disorders, that ultimately lead to structural and functional decline of the joint with associated lameness and pain. Increasing understanding of the risk factors associated with osteoarthritis will assist in addressing the significant threat it poses to the welfare of the dog population and implementing preventive measures. Presented here, is the first comprehensive systematic review and evaluation of the literature reporting risk factors for canine osteoarthritis. This paper aimed to systematically collate, review and critically evaluate the published literature on risk factors for canine osteoarthritis and its predisposing conditions such as developmental joint dysplasias, cruciate ligament degeneration, and patellar luxation. Peer-reviewed publications were systematically searched for both osteoarthritis and predisposing arthropathies on Web of Science and PubMed following PRISMA (2009) guidelines, using pre-specified combinations of keywords. Sixty-two papers met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated and graded on reporting quality. Identified risk factors included both modifiable factors (neuter status and body weight) for which intervention can potentially affect the risk of occurrence of osteoarthritis, and unmodifiable factors (sex, breed, and age) which can be used to identify individuals most "at risk." Osteoarthritis in dogs frequently develops from predisposing arthropathies, and therefore risk factors for these are also important to consider. Papers evaluated in this study were rated as medium to high-quality; gap analysis of the literature suggests there would be significant benefit from additional research into the interactions between and relative weighting of risk factors. There are a number of examples where research outcomes are conflicting such as age and sex; and further investigation into these factors would be beneficial to attain greater understanding of the nature of these risks. Comprehensively collating the published risk factors for osteoarthritis and its predisposing conditions offers opportunities to identify possible means for control and reduction within the population through preventative methods and control strategies. These factors are highlighted here, as well as current literature gaps where further research is warranted, to aid future research direction.},

Periodontal disease (PD) is associated to other systemic diseases, and inflammation may be responsible for the association. Consequently, controlling inflammation not only may benefit oral health but also may assist with the management of other chronic inflammatory conditions. We aimed to investigate the effects of resveratrol administration on PD control in preclinical studies. A systematic search was performed for scientific articles using both electronic databases and a manual search using combinations of the following search terms: "resveratrol" OR "3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene" AND "periodontal disease" OR "periodontitis" OR "gingivitis". Only in vivo original studies investigating resveratrol treatment on experimental animal models of PD were selected. A quality assessment of the studies was performed using the Animal Research Reporting In Vivo Experiment (ARRIVE) guidelines, and the risk of bias was assessed using the Syrcle tool. The search returned 570 articles, and 11 matched the inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis showed that resveratrol treatment attenuated alveolar bone loss (T$^{\textrm{2}}$=0.0041; 95\% CI: -0.14; -0.04). The ARRIVE criteria reported a good quality of studies in general (mean score 28.5+or-2.5). However, five Syrcle domains indicated a high risk of bias or did not present information clearly.

	abstract = {Mathematical modelling is nowadays a pivotal tool for infectious diseases studies, completing regular biological investigations. The rapid growth of computer technology allowed for development of computational tools to address biological issues that could not be unravelled in the past. The global understanding of viral disease dynamics requires to account for all interactions at all levels, from within-host to between-herd, to have all the keys for development of control measures. A literature review was performed to disentangle modelling frameworks according to their major objectives and methodologies. One hundred and seventeen articles published between 1994 and 2020 were found to meet our inclusion criteria, which were defined to target papers representative of studies dealing with models of viral infection dynamics in pigs. A first descriptive analysis, using bibliometric indexes, permitted to identify keywords strongly related to the study scopes. Modelling studies were focused on particular infectious agents, with a shared objective: to better understand the viral dynamics for appropriate control measure adaptation. In a second step, selected papers were analysed to disentangle the modelling structures according to the objectives of the studies. The system representation was highly dependent on the nature of the pathogens. Enzootic viruses, such as swine influenza or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, were generally investigated at the herd scale to analyse the impact of husbandry practices and prophylactic measures on infection dynamics. Epizootic agents (classical swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease or African swine fever viruses) were mostly studied using spatio-temporal simulation tools, to investigate the efficiency of surveillance and control protocols, which are predetermined for regulated diseases. A huge effort was made on model parameterization through the development of specific studies and methodologies insuring the robustness of parameter values to feed simulation tools. Integrative modelling frameworks, from within-host to spatio-temporal models, is clearly on the way. This would allow to capture the complexity of individual biological variabilities and to assess their consequences on the whole system at the population level. This would offer the opportunity to test and evaluate in silico the efficiency of possible control measures targeting specific epidemiological units, from hosts to herds, either individually or through their contact networks. Such decision support tools represent a strength for stakeholders to help mitigating infectious diseases dynamics and limiting economic consequences.},

	abstract = {Background: Due to their antimicrobial properties and safety, essential oils are currently proposed as a sustainable option for antibiotic alternatives in the livestock sector. This current systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the effects of dietary essential oil supplements on dry matter intake (DMI), average daily gain (ADG), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of small ruminants. Methods: A total of 12 studies (338 small ruminants) were included in this meta-analysis. The overall effect size was quantified using Hedges' g with 95\% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model. Publication bias was inspected using Begg's and Egger's tests, followed by trim and fill method to detect the number of potential missing studies. Results: Insignificant heterogeneity among studies was detected both on DMI ( P of Q = 0.810; I-square = 0.00\%), ADG ( P of Q = 0.286; I-square = 17.61\%), and FCR ( P of Q = 0.650; I-square = 0.00\%). The overall effect size showed that essential oils supplementation had no significant impact on DMI (Hedges' g = -0.12; 95\% CI = -0.50 to 0.26; P = 0.429) and FCR (Hedges' g = -0.17; 95\% CI = -0.55 to 0.22; P = 0.284), but had a significant positive impact on ADG (Hedges' g = 0.44; 95\% CI = 0.12 to 0.76; P = 0.002). The result of publication bias analysis showed that DMI, ADG, and FCR did not present any significant biases ( P {\textgreater} 0.10), and no potential missing studies detected. Conclusions: Dietary essential oil could improve ADG of small ruminants, without any alteration on DMI and FCR. Further research in this topic is still required to provide stronger evidence of the potency of essential oil as a growth promoter for small ruminants.},

	abstract = {Rabies is one of the most feared infectious diseases worldwide, predominantly occurring in Asia and Africa where rabies is endemic in domestic dog populations. Whereas previous studies have demonstrated mass dog vaccination and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) as the most effective control strategies, successful rabies elimination has yet to be realized as these recognized effective interventions continue to face challenges of limited accessibility. In the light of new evidence towards improving programmatic feasibility and clinical practice in rabies control especially among endemic countries, a systematic review was undertaken to identify cost-effectiveness modelling studies of rabies preventive measures and to provide a critical review of published evidence through comparative evaluation and model quality assessment, and a synthesis of key findings based thereon. Our search through MEDLINE and SCOPUS identified a total of 17 studies which mostly focused on estimating the impact of increasing PEP and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) access, human rabies elimination scenarios using mass dog vaccinations only or complemented with PEP strategy. While no significant methodological inconsistency across studies was identified and the extent of reporting is generally high, we note several points for quality and internal validity improvement. Assessment of modelling approach showed that decision tree models had similar pathways. The results of the studies suggest that interventions would be cost-effective at the cost-effectiveness threshold of 1 to 3 times per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as recommended by the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health's GDP based thresholds, compared with no intervention in rabies endemic countries. When compared across studies which reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as cost per QALY gained or DALY averted in international dollars adjusted by purchasing power parity conversion rate, PEP vaccination yields less cost per DALY averted or QALY gained due to one year-horizon assessment compared to canine vaccination at 4- or 10-year-time horizon.},

It has been recognized as an important cause of epidemic and endemic abortion in cattle around the world. There is no study to demonstrate the country level picture of the disease in Iran and estimate the extent of the problem, quantitatively. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to systematically review the observational studies on bovine neosporosis in Iran and estimate an overall serologic prevalence of the infection in the cattle population. Search for all published reports on N. caninum in Iran was conducted from inception until September 2018. Major English (PubMed, Scopus and Science Direct) and Persian (IranDoc, SID, Iranmedex, and Magiran) electronic database sources were used for this study. After removing duplicated articles, 128 documents remained. Unrelated articles (89) were excluded after primary screening and 39 articles were evaluated for eligibility. Finally, 37 studies from 33 articles were recognized as eligible and were included in the present work. The author screened the studies and extracted the data twice, carefully. Based on the meta-analysis, the overall serologic prevalence of N. caninum in 10,967 cattle with 2619 positive ones was 23.6 \% with 95 \% CI: 19.8-27.9 \%. The random effect model was used for meta-analysis because the Cochran Q value (795.10, df = 36, P {\textless} 0.001) and Higgins index (I(2) = 95.47 \%) showed statistically significant heterogeneity. In subgroup meta-analysis, abortion status of the animal and geographical location of the study showed significant association with serologic prevalence, while age and breed did not have significant associations. No publication bias was detected, and sensitivity analysis showed stability of the overall estimate after excluding any individual study. It could be concluded that N. caninum is widespread in cattle population in Iran and the time is right to implement national level educational and control programs for it.},

While an upper limit of alpha-lipoic acid intake in humans has not been conclusively determined, the levels for oral intake of a-LA have been better defined in animals, and distinct differences based on species have been described. The maximum tolerated oral dose of a-LA in dogs has been reported as 126 mg/kg body weight and the LD(50) as 400 to 500 mg/kg body weight. The antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuro-protective benefits of alpha-lipoic acid in dogs were observed at concentrations much lower than the maximum tolerated dose or proposed LD(50). At concentrations of 2.7-4.94 mg/kg body weight/day, alpha-lipoic acid is well tolerated and posed no health risks to dogs while providing improved antioxidant capacity. This review thereby supports the utility of alpha-lipoic acid as an effective nutritive additive in dog food.},

Among antimicrobials, critically important ones are therapeutic drugs that should be primarily safeguarded to allow successful outcomes against important bacterial infections in humans. The most important source of antimicrobial resistance has been recognized in the inappropriate use of antimicrobials in human and animal medicine, with farming being a critical stage. Products of animal origin are the link between animal and humans and can contribute to the spread of antimicrobial resistance, in particular through bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae, commonly present in both animals' gut and food. Salmonella is an important member of this bacterial family due to its pathogenicity, its noteworthy prevalence and the frequent detection of resistance genes in different isolates. In the present systematic review, the distribution of antimicrobial resistance determinants among Salmonella enterica serovars in pigs, cattle and poultry production was investigated in the European context. A comprehensive literature search was carried out in three different databases, and 7955 papers were identified as relevant. After the different steps of the review process, 31 papers were considered eligible for data extraction to gain insight about sources and reservoirs for such genes. Results suggest that despite the increasing attention directed toward antimicrobial resistance in animal production, a wide plethora of genes still exist and further actions should be undertaken to face this challenge.},

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the prevalence rate and status of Sarcocystis spp. in ruminants as important food sources in Iran. METHODS: Data were collected from papers indexed in five English language electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar) and four Persian electronic databases (IranMedex, SID, IranDoc, and Magiran) from January to April 2019. Papers were selected based on inclusion criteria. Data analysis was performed in StatsDirect statistical software, version 2.7.2. RESULTS: The searching process resulted in the identification of 73 studies. Data analyses revealed that the total prevalence (95\% confidence intervals) of Sarcocystis spp. in Iranian ruminants was 74.40\% (64.01-83.56). In addition, a significant association was also observed between sarcocystosis infection in Iranian ruminants and year, host, location, and diagnostic technique (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: According to our data, the prevalence of Sarcocystis infection in ruminants is relatively high. High pathogenicity of some Sarcocystis spp. and the negative impact that the spread of some parasites among ruminants can have on human and animal health necessitate the direction of more attention toward monitoring, controlling, and preventing sarcocystosis.},

	abstract = {Hydatidosis is a potential zoonotic helminthic disease affecting a broad spectrum of mammals, including humans, worldwide. The current review was conducted to investigate the genotypic status and prevalence of hydatid disease in camels across the world. For the purpose of the study, the articles addressing the worldwide prevalence of hydatidosis in camels were searched in several English language databases. The search process resulted in the inclusion of 122 papers. Based on the data presented in the reviewed articles, the pooled prevalence of hydatid disease in camels across the world was measured at 23.75\% (95\% CI 20.15-27.55). Moreover, the subgroup analysis demonstrated significant differences in the overall prevalence of hydatidosis among camels based on year, geographic area, climate parameters, camel population, gender, infected organ, fertility rate of the cyst and laboratory diagnostic technique. Furthermore, the Echinococcus granulosus genotypes identified in camels with hydatidosis included G1, G2, G3, G1-G3, G5, G6, G7, G6-G7 and G6-G10, with G6 being the most common genotype throughout the world. The data obtained from the current study are central to the better conceptualization of the biological and epidemiological characteristics of E. granulosus s.l. genotypes around the world, which can be helpful in the planning and adoption of more comprehensive control strategies.},

The disease imposes high expenditures and economic losses in medical and veterinary. Prophylactic vaccination would be one of the effective preventive health care against echinococcosis. During the last decades, many studies have characterized the protective antigens of Echinococcus granulosus and their role in immunization of various animal host species. Herein, we aimed to systematically evaluate and represent the best antigens as possible vaccine candidates for cystic echinococcosis. Data were systematically searched from five databases including ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect and Web of Science, up to 1 February 2020. Two reviewers independently screened and assessed data extraction and quality assessment. A total of 47 articles were eligible for inclusion criteria in the current study. The most common antigens used for vaccination against E. granulosus were EG95 and antigen B. Freund's adjuvant and Quil A have been predominantly utilized. In addition, regarding the antigen delivery, animal models, measurement of immune responses and reduction in hydatid cyst have been discussed in the text. The data demonstrated that DNA vaccines with antigen B and recombinant protein vaccines based on EG95 antigen have the best results and elicited protective immune responses.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Neospora caninum is an obligate intracellular apicomplexan protozoan that causes neurological disorders in dogs. This systematic review and meta-analysis targeted at evaluating the worldwide seroprevalence rate of N. caninum in dogs. METHODS: Five electronic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar, until December 2018 were thoroughly searched for relevant English language articles. Papers were selected based on inclusion criteria. Data were analyzed in StatsDirect statistical software (version 2.7.9). RESULTS: The searching process yielded a total number of 156 papers. The total prevalence (95\% confidence intervals) of N. caninum infection in dog population worldwide was measured as 17.14\% in data analyses (15.25-19.10). In addition, a significant association was also detected between neosporosis infection in dogs and continent, country, year, WHO regions, sample size and diagnostic method (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: Dogs are a matter of concern to public health officials as a source of N. caninum infection. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to provide comprehensive data and systematically analyze the prevalence of N. caninum infection in dogs. Accordingly, it is recommended that researchers carry out further studies to prevent and control neosporosis among dog population worldwide.},

	abstract = {First-line therapy for advanced or metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) involves the removal of tumor-promoting androgens by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), resulting in transient tumor regression. Recurrent disease is attributed to tumor adaptation to survive, despite lower circulating androgen concentrations, making the blockage of downstream androgen signaling a chemotherapeutic goal for PCa. Dietary intake of tomato and its predominant carotenoid, lycopene, reduce the risk for PCa, and preclinical studies have shown promising results that tomato and lycopene can inhibit androgen signaling in normal prostate tissue. The goal of this systematic review was to evaluate whether mechanistic evidence exists to support the hypothesis that tomato or lycopene interact with the androgen axis in PCa. Eighteen studies (n = 5 in vivo; n = 13 in vitro) were included in the final review. A formal meta-analysis was not feasible due to variability of the data; however, the overall estimated directions of effect for the compared studies were visually represented by albatross plots. All studies demonstrated either null or, more commonly, inhibitory effects of tomato or lycopene treatment on androgen-related outcomes. Strong mechanistic evidence was unable to be ascertained, but tomato and lycopene treatment appears to down-regulate androgen metabolism and signaling in PCa.},

We herein report a general improvement in technical standards throughout the temporal span examined; however, significant methodological limitations are also identified. We propose easily actionable avenues for ameliorating these shortcomings and enhancing the reach of this field. Text mining and pathway analysis corroborate the relevance of proteins and metabolites related to the triad oxidative stress-inflammation-disease on reproductive function. We envisage a breakthrough in cattle reproductive molecular research within the next few years as in vivo sample techniques are improved, omics analysis equipment becomes more affordable and widespread, and software tools for single- and multi-omics data processing are further developed. Additional investigation of the impact of local oxidative stress and inflammation on fertility, both at the local and systemic levels, is key towards realising the full potential of this field.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anaesthetic neuroprotection in the setting of traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains unproved and is based upon the results in preclinical experiments. Here, we sought to synthesise the results in rodent models of TBI, and to evaluate the effects of publication bias, experimental manipulation, and poor study quality on the effect estimates. METHODS: After a systematic review, we used pairwise meta-analysis to estimate the effect of anaesthetics, opioids, and sedative-hypnotics on neurological outcome, and network meta-analysis to compare their relative efficacy. We sought evidence of bias related to selective publication, experimental manipulation, and study quality. RESULTS: Sixteen studies, involving 32 comparisons, were included (546 animals). The treatment improved the neurological outcomes by 35\%; 95\% confidence interval: 26-44\%; P{\textless}0.001. The statistical heterogeneity was small (12\%), but the 95\% prediction interval for the estimate was wide (15-56\%). The statistical power was low: 61\% (90\% confidence interval: 22-86\%). The small sample size in the studies was a serious shortcoming reducing the statistical heterogeneity and obscuring differences in outcome between drugs and between experimental conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Anaesthetics do provide neuroprotection in rodent models of TBI. The effect-size estimates do not appear to be exaggerated by selective publication, experimental manipulation, or study design. The main shortcoming of the included studies were small sample sizes leading to low power and imprecision, which precluded the network meta-analysis from providing a meaningful ranking for efficacy amongst the drugs. Reliable preclinical investigations of neuroprotection by anaesthetics will require larger sample sizes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surra is an animal trypanosomosis, caused by infection with Trypanosoma evansi and leading to severe economic loss due to mortality and morbidity. Compared to tsetse-transmitted animal trypanosomoses, little attention is given to the epidemiology and control of surra. Understanding its epidemiology is a first step in local and global efforts to control the disease. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies on distribution, host ranges and prevalence of T. evansi infection. METHODS: Four electronic databases were searched for publications on T. evansi that met our inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Subsets of publications were subjected to meta-analysis for the pooled prevalence of T. evansi in various hosts as determined by multiple detection methods. RESULTS: A total of 272 references published between 1906-2017 were included. Trypanosoma evansi was reported from 48 countries; largely confined to Africa and Asia with publications on natural T. evansi infections from 77\% (n = 48) of countries, contrasting with seven countries in South America, and four in Europe where T. evansi is not endemic but was imported with infected animals. Although surra is a notifiable disease, many countries do not report surra cases to OIE. Trypanosoma evansi was mainly reported from dromedary camels in Africa and the Middle East, water buffaloes, cattle, dogs and horses in East and Southeast Asia. In South America, the acute form of the disease was reported in horses and dogs. Surra was also reported in a wide range of wild animals. Some rare human cases occurred in India and Vietnam. Meta-analysis on a subset of 165 publications indicated pooled prevalence of T. evansi in domestic animals ranging from 14-31\%, 6-28\% and 2-9\% using respectively antibody detection, molecular and parasitological tests, with camels as the most affected, followed by buffalo and cattle. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates that T. evansi affects a wide range of domestic and wild animals in Africa, Asia and South America with highest prevalence observed in dromedary camels. For successful control of T. evansi, both locally and globally, the role of wild animals in the epidemiology of surra needs further investigation.},

This part of a three-article series will analyze urinary bladder hypertrophy in the diabetes mellitus type 1 model of rats injected with streptozotocin (STZ). METHODS: A systematic search for the key word combination "diabetes," "bladder" and "hypertrophy" was performed in PubMed; additional references were identified from reference lists of those publications. All papers were systematically extracted for relevant information. RESULTS: A total of 39 studies were identified that quantitatively reported on bladder hypertrophy in rats upon injection of STZ; of which several reported on multiple time points yielding a total of 83 group comparisons. Bladder hypertrophy was found consistently, being fully developed as early as 1 week after STZ injection (bladder weight 188 ± 59\% of matched control). Hypertrophy was similar across sexes and STZ doses (35-40 vs 50-65 mg/kg) but appeared greater with Wistar rats than other rat strains. The extent of bladder hypertrophy was not correlated to blood glucose concentrations, but normalization of blood glucose concentration by insulin treatment starting early after STZ injection prevented hypertrophy; insulin treatment starting after hypertrophy had established largely reversed it. CONCLUSIONS: Bladder size approximately doubles after STZ injection in rats; the extent of hypertrophy is not linked to the severity of hyperglycemia but largely reversible by restoration of euglycemia.},

This review aimed to identify specific constraints to small ruminant production and identify practical and sustainable solutions. From 54 eligible articles, most were focused in Ethiopia (n = 44) with only 6 studies performed in Tanzania and 4 in Uganda. The most frequently identified constraint in Ethiopia and Tanzania was disease (n = 28 and n = 3, respectively), and in Uganda, it was the lack of access to veterinary services (n = 4). Additionally, access to good breeding stock, lack of animal records, and an established marketing chain were also mentioned in all the three countries. Ectoparasites, gastrointestinal parasites, orf, and sheep/goat pox were the most frequently mentioned disease challenges causing productivity losses. Many articles provided potential solutions as suggested by farmers, including improved access to veterinary services and medicines, improved record keeping, and access to good breeding stock. Farmers highlighted the value of community-based participatory development plans to increase education on disease control, land management, and husbandry. This review also highlighted knowledge gaps, the need for further research, particularly in Tanzania and Uganda, and the importance of addressing multiple challenges holistically due to the links between constraints.},

	abstract = {AIM: Animal studies are an important knowledge base when information from clinical trials is missing or conflicting. The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effect of conventional targeted temperature management (TTM) between 32-36 °C in animal cardiac arrest models, and to estimate the influence of effect modifiers on the pooled effect of TTM. DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline and Scopus from inception to May 2020 for randomised controlled animal trials assessing the effect of conventional TTM versus normothermia on neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest. We extracted data on study characteristics, study quality data, neurologic outcome, mortality, and potential effect modifiers. RESULTS: We retrieved 1635 studies, 45 studies comprising data of 981 animals met the inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was high in 17 studies and moderate in 28 studies. We undertook random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses to calculate the pooled effect and the influence of effect modifiers. There was a strong beneficial effect of TTM as compared to normothermia on neurologic outcome (standardised mean difference of 1.4 [95\% CI -1.7 to -1.1; I(2) = 75\%]). Faster cooling rates, lower target temperature of TTM within the range of 32-36 °C, and shorter duration of cooling were independently associated with an increasing effect size of TTM. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review of animal cardiac arrest studies showed a consistent favourable effect of postresuscitation TTM as compared to normothermia on neurologic outcome that increased with lower target temperatures.},

Emerging applications of mass depopulation include reducing welfare issues associated with slaughter delays, which was observed in the United States in 2020 as a result of the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The objectives of this review were to summarize the available literature on swine depopulation methods and to highlight critical gaps in knowledge. Peer-reviewed articles were identified through a systematic search in electronic databases including Web of Science, MEDLINE, and PubMed. A total of 68 publications were assessed. Gaseous carbon dioxide inhalation was the most commonly reported depopulation method for both small- and large-scale trials. Measurements of consciousness state, which serves to assess suffering and humaneness, appeared to be lacking in a high proportion of the studies. None of the published studies demonstrated an ideally reliable and safe way to induce rapid unconsciousness in large groups of pigs. Development of rapid mass depopulation methods applicable to large groups of pigs is necessary to provide industry partners with suitable and low-cost emergency preparedness procedures while adhering to personnel safety and animal welfare standards. Lastly, there is an urgent need to standardize comprehensive reporting guidelines for depopulation studies.},

	doi = {10.3168/jds.2019-16842},
	abstract = {The objectives were to use meta-analytic methods to determine the effects of amount of supplemental choline ion as rumen-protected choline (RPC) starting prepartum on production and health of dairy cows. The literature was systematically reviewed and 21 experiments, with up to 66 treatment means and 1,313 prepartum parous cows, were included. All experiments had a treatment with no supplemental choline (0 g/d; n = 30 treatment means), and the amount of choline ion supplemented to treated cows ranged from 5.6 to 25.2 g/d (n = 36 treatment means). Duration of pre- and postpartum feeding of RPC averaged (±standard deviation) 22.0 ± 6.0 and 57.5 ± 42.2 d, respectively. Data collected included the ingredient composition and chemical analyses of pre- and postpartum diets, amount of choline ion supplemented, number of cows per treatment, frequency of health events, and the least squares means and respective standard error of the means for production responses, liver composition, and blood parameters. The concentrations of net energy for lactation and metabolizable amino acids and protein (MP) in pre- and postpartum diets were predicted for each treatment mean using National Research Council (2001). Mixed model meta-analysis was conducted including the random effect of experiment and weighting by the inverse of the standard error of the means squared. Increasing supplementation of choline ion during transition linearly increased pre- (β = 0.0184 ± 0.00425) and postpartum dry matter intake (β = 0.0378 ± 0.00974), and yields of milk (β = 0.436 ± 0.112), energy-corrected milk (ECM; β = 0.422 ± 0.0992), fat (β = 0.00555 ± 0.000793), and protein (β = 0.0138 ± 0.00378). Nevertheless, an interaction between choline and postpartum metabolizable methionine as a percent of MP (METMPPo) was observed for yields of milk, ECM, and protein because as METMPPo increased, the positive response to choline on yields of milk, ECM, and protein decreased. Supplementing choline during transition tended to reduce the risks of retained placenta and mastitis, but it had no effect on metritis, milk fever, displaced abomasum and ketosis, or the concentration of triacylglycerol in the hepatic tissue postpartum. The median amount of choline ion supplemented was 12.9 g/d and responses in postpartum dry matter intake and yields of milk, ECM, fat, and protein to that amount of supplementation were 0.5, 1.6, 1.7, 0.07, and 0.05 kg/d, respectively. No interactions were observed between supplemental choline and prepartum dietary net energy for lactation or metabolizable methionine as a percent of MP. Collectively, feeding RPC during the transition period improves performance in parous cows. Increases in yields of milk and milk components were observed in spite of pre- and postpartum diets, although the increments in milk, ECM, and protein yields with supplementing choline decreased as the concentration of methionine in postpartum diets increased. The optimum dose of choline ion was not detected, but likely it is more than the 12.9 g/d fed in most experiments evaluated in the current meta-analysis. Finally, the meta-analysis identified lack of sufficient data to understand the role of supplemental choline in nulliparous cows.},

	abstract = {Zoonoses present a major public health threat and are estimated to account for a substantial part of the infectious disease burden in low-income countries. The severity of zoonotic diseases is compounded by factors such as poverty, living in close contact with livestock and wildlife, immunosuppression as well as coinfection with other diseases. The interconnections between humans, animals and the environment are essential to understand the spread and subsequent containment of zoonoses. We searched three scientific databases for articles relevant to the epidemiology of bacterial zoonoses/zoonotic bacterial pathogens, including disease prevalence and control measures in humans and multiple animal species, in various African countries within the period from 2008 to 2018. The review identified 1966 articles, of which 58 studies in 29 countries met the quality criteria for data extraction. The prevalence of brucellosis, leptospirosis, Q fever ranged from 0-40\%, 1.1-24\% and 0.9-28.2\%, respectively, depending on geographical location and even higher in suspected outbreak cases. Risk factors for human zoonotic infection included exposure to livestock and animal slaughters. Dietary factors linked with seropositivity were found to include consumption of raw milk and locally fermented milk products. It was found that zoonoses such as leptospirosis, brucellosis, Q fever and rickettsiosis among others are frequently under/misdiagnosed in febrile patients seeking treatment at healthcare centres, leading to overdiagnoses of more familiar febrile conditions such as malaria and typhoid fever. The interactions at the human-animal interface contribute substantially to zoonotic infections. Seroprevalence of the various zoonoses varies by geographic location and species. There is a need to build laboratory capacity and effective surveillance processes for timely and effective detection and control of zoonoses in Africa. A multifaceted 'One Health' approach to tackle zoonoses is critical in the fight against zoonotic diseases. The impacts of zoonoses include.},

However, evidence-based knowledge on FLI has remained unavailable. The main objectives of this study were to investigate the status of felines infected by Leishmania spp. worldwide. Data were extracted from 10 available databases over the period of 1982 to 2017. Overall, 78 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were used for data extraction in this systematic review. The overall FLI prevalence by both serological and molecular methods was estimated at 10\% (95\% CI: 8\%-14\%). In Italy, both the seroprevalence (24 \%) and PCR prevalence (21 \%) were found to be higher than in other countries. The most common diagnostic test used was the indirect fluorescent antibody test (38.5\%). Studies on mixed-breed felines were more common than those on other breeds, while the most common parasite species was L. infantum (63\%). Our findings suggest that cats act as primary and/or secondary reservoir hosts in the transmission of the Leishmania spp. to humans and also to dogs, by sandflies, at least in endemic foci. Moreover, available data confirm the enzootic stability situation of FLI in several countries including some in Europe.},

	abstract = {In Ethiopia, poultry production is an important source of domestic food and nutrition security while providing income for nearly 80\% of Ethiopians. However, several infectious and parasitic diseases hamper poultry production. To date, evidence on the nationwide burden of specific diseases has not been collated to inform targeting of poultry health interventions. The objective of this systematic review is to summarize and analyze the literature on poultry diseases since 2000. A detailed systematic review protocol was designed according to Cochrane collaboration, Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE), and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements. The review revealed that 14 infectious and parasitic diseases of poultry were reported in 110 published studies from 2000 to 2017, and 81.82\% (90/110) of the studies covered 6 diseases: Newcastle disease (ND), infectious bursal disease (IBD), avian coccidiosis, helminth infestation, ecto-parasite infestation, and Salmonella infection. The pooled prevalence estimates of ND and IBD were 44\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 27 to 63) and 41\% (95\% CI: 23 to 60), respectively. Among the parasitic diseases, avian coccidiosis, helminth infestation, and ecto-parasite infestation had estimated pooled prevalences of 37\% (95\% CI: 30 to 44), 62\% (95\% CI: 45 to 78), and 50\% (95\% CI: 33 to 68), respectively. The pooled prevalence estimate of Salmonella infection was found to be 51\% (95\% CI: 32 to 70). Most of the studies were conducted in central Ethiopia, in the State of Oromia, and focused on extensive farming systems. While the number of studies was low, the overall trend of disease reporting in the literature is increasing (Y = 0.99X-3.34). In conclusion, the high-pooled prevalence estimates of diseases and the scarcity of reported data for all of Ethiopia indicate an important data gap on infectious-disease distribution in the country. While the high-pooled prevalence points towards the need for intervention to control poultry diseases, there is also a need to ensure all diseases that result in production losses and public health risks are studied appropriately in all Ethiopian production systems.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The present systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed to assess the weighted molecular prevalence of Blastocystis sp. in humans along with the comparative molecular prevalence and subtypes distribution of Blastocystis isolated from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in Iran. METHODS: International electronic databases including Medline/PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar were explored until 4th October 2020. Heterogeneity index was evaluated among studies using Cochran's Q test and I(2) index. Finally, 23 eligible studies were qualified to be included in this review. RESULTS: The pooled molecular prevalence of Blastocystis sp. in Iran was reported 15.2\% (95\% CI 11.5-19.7). In addition, the molecular prevalence based on PCR-sequencing and STS primers was reported 12.5\% (95\% CI 8.6-17.7) and 19.8\% (95\% CI 13.1-28.8), respectively. Interestingly, there was a considerably higher prevalence among asymptomatic patients [25.1\% (95\% CI 20.8-30.0)] in comparison to symptomatic ones [21.0\% (95\% CI 15.9-27.2)]. In addition, the frequency of Blastocystis ST1, ST2, and ST3 from positive samples in symptomatic patients was 19.7\%, 35.1\%, and 47.4\%, respectively. In addition, the prevalence of Blastocystis ST1, ST2, and ST3 from positive samples in asymptomatic patients was 27.1\%, 26.8\%, and 37.8\%, respectively. The results obtained in Iran showed that Blastocystis is more common in asymptomatic patients compared to patients having clinical symptoms. Of note, ST3, as the most common subtype causing clinical symptoms, was the most prevalent reported subtype among both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in the country. CONCLUSIONS: Hence, the pathogenicity of the Blastocystis parasite is not subtype-specific and appears to be related to a variety of risk factors. Still the Blastocystis epidemiology is open to question and more large-scale studies should be performed on this aspect.},

	abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease of livestock with serious economic and public health impact in Ethiopia. The disease is reported from cattle, small ruminants and dromedary camels in the country. However, there is no organized summary report on the magnitude and distribution pattern of TB in small ruminants and dromedary camels, unlike that of bovine TB. Consequent to this gap, this review was organized to provide pooled prevalence estimates, and examine level of heterogeneity among studies at national level. In addition, it attempts to illustrate the spatial distribution patterns along the three livestock species based on available reports. Tuberculosis articles on the aforesaid livestock species were searched online using PubMed, CAB direct, Web of Science and AJOL databases. Eighteen articles published from January 2000 to May 15, 2020, written in the English language that fulfill the selection quality criteria were considered for the review. Altogether, 50 district based observational studies conducted on 10,371 goats, 6262 dromedary camels, and 1457 sheep were used for analysis. Accordingly, the pooled prevalence estimates of TB, in a random effect model were 2.3 \% (95 \% CI: 1.7, 3.1) for goats, 0.8 \% (95 \% CI: 0.5, 1.4) for sheep and 8.2 \% (95 \% CI: 6.6, 10.2) for dromedary camels. The subgroup analysis revealed presence of statistically significant differences (p {\textless} 0.001) in pooled prevalence estimates among the three species. In multivariable meta-regression model, diagnostic methods used for screening (single intra-dermal comparative cervical tuberculin test (SICCTT){\textgreater} 2mm, SICCTT {\textgreater} 4mm and detailed postmortem inspection) were the only predictors identified to show statistically significant difference (p{\textless}0.001) and explained 68.6 \% of the explainable heterogeneity (R(2) =0.686) in goat TB studies. In general, study reports on small ruminant and dromedary camel TB are limited throughout the country. The most significant data gaps were in Gambella, and Benshangul-Gumuz regional states, where no single report could be retrieved on small ruminant TB. Limitation of study reports and lack of comparable categories constrained further investigation on other predictors in sheep and camel studies. Thus, the authors would like to emphasize the need for more representative studies in the species of concern in all regions of the country. Meanwhile, the relatively higher proportion of TB in dromedary camels demands special attention in arid and semiarid parts of the country, as it is the leading livestock species on which agropastoralist and pastoralists livelihoods depend.},

	abstract = {Lungworms are important parasitic nematodes of small ruminants that colonize the lower respiratory tract and cause high morbidity and economic loss throughout the world. This systematic review was conducted with the aim of estimating the pooled prevalence of lungworm infection in small ruminants in Ethiopia. Besides, it examines the predictors thought to be responsible for heterogeneity noted between the reports. The search databases used were PubMed, CAB direct, AJOL and Web of science. Eligible studies were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Thirty two studies published between 2000 and 2016 were found eligible and data were generated on 14,257 small ruminants (12,310 sheep and 1947 goats). Predictors including the study area, type of small ruminants affected, parasitic species involved, a diagnostic test used, study design, management systems, breed, agroecology, and year article published were used as milestone of data extraction. The statistical tool employed were meta-analysis, univariable and multivariable meta-regression and Egger's and begg's statistics for sensitivity analysis. Accordingly, the estimated pooled prevalence of lung worm infection in small ruminants was 40.8\% (95\% CI: 36.1, 45.6) with a very high heterogeneity between the study reports (I(2) = 96.5\%). However, diagnostic test used and administrative States were the only two predictors identified to explain 15.5\% of the explainable heterogeneity (R(2) = 0.1545, tau(2) unexplained = 0.6032, tau(2) total = 0.7135) noted between studies. The reviewed studies showed that three genera of lungworms, namely Dictyocaulus filaria, Mullerius capillaris and Protostrogylus rufescens were prevalent both in sheep and goats in Ethiopia. Mixed infection with two or three species was reported in 4.4 to 48.6\% of the total infected animals. Indeed this review is informative and provides a better picture on lungworm infection in Ethiopia; however, it is not exhaustively detailed as there was lack of clear data on the role of some important factors like age, flock size, management system and seasonal variation on lungworm infection. Thus, thorough epidemiological studies including all seasons are required for formulation of meaning full control strategies.},

	abstract = {Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by obligate intracellular protozoa of the genus Leishmania. Ethiopia does not have an overall estimation of prevalence of leishmaniasis infection at a country level. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize and pool estimates of studies that report the prevalence of leishmaniasis in Ethiopia. The literature search was conducted to identify all published studies reporting the prevalence of leishmaniasis with clearly designed inclusion and exclusion criteria. From all screened articles, 30 studies were eligible for final meta-analysis and systematic review. Because substantial heterogeneity was expected, random-effects meta-analyses were carried out using the total sample size and number of positives to estimate the prevalence of the disease at a country level. Between-study variability was high (τ(2) = 0.02; heterogeneity I(2) = 99.72\% with Heterogeneity chi-square = 11985.41, a degree of freedom = 33 and P = 0.001). The overall random pooled prevalence of leishmaniasis was 19\% (95\% CI 14\%-24\%). Meta-regression analysis showed that diagnosis method used have contributed to the heterogeneity of studies. Molecular diagnosis has significantly lower prevalence than microscopic examination with a coefficient of -0.32, a p-value of 0.024, and CI (-0.6-0.05). The result of effect estimates against its standard error showed there was no publication bias with a P value of 0.084. This review indicated that there is still a higher prevalence of Leishmaniasis in the country. Reporting on risk factors like sex and age affected, species of Leishmania involved and many more other risk factors reviewing was not possible in this study due to lack of completeness in articles included. However, this report is an indication that the country needs nationally coordinated extensive prevention and control plan to reduce public health and socio-economic impact of the disease.},

The occurrence of Escherichia coli in foods of animal origin in Ethiopia is arguably high due to many reasons like illegal slaughtering of animals in open fields, unhygienic slaughter practices in the abattoirs, and the risk of disease due to this organism is high because of a widespread tradition of raw meat consumption. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to pool estimates of the prevalence of the organism in different foods of animal origin which is the first of its kind in the country. The literature search was conducted to identify all published articles reporting the prevalence of Escherichia coli in foods of animal origin.

Due to the expected variation between studies, a random-effects meta-analysis was carried out using the total sample size and number of positives (effect size and standard error of the effect size). Individual study prevalence estimates ranged from 0\% to 20\% with an overall pooled prevalence of 7\% (95\% CI = 5\%-8\%). Studies weighted approximately equal with weights on individual studies ranging from 2\% to 2.6\% due to high heterogeneity between studies.

This paper aims to identify and compare the different spatial and spatio-temporal Bayesian modelling methods that have been applied to DF and examine influential covariates that have been reportedly associated with the risk of DF. A systematic search was performed in December 2017, using Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, PubMed, ProQuest and Medline (via Ebscohost) electronic databases. The search was restricted to refereed journal articles published in English from January 2000 to November 2017. Thirty-one articles met the inclusion criteria. Using a modified quality assessment tool, the median quality score across studies was 14/16. The most popular Bayesian statistical approach to dengue modelling was a generalised linear mixed model with spatial random effects described by a conditional autoregressive prior. A limited number of studies included spatio-temporal random effects. Temperature and precipitation were shown to often influence the risk of dengue. Developing spatio-temporal random-effect models, considering other priors, using a dataset that covers an extended time period, and investigating other covariates would help to better understand and control DF transmission.},

Albeit, it seems that the anti-obesity effect of ginger and its mechanism of action has not yet been reviewed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically review the effect of Zingiber officinale Roscoe on obesity management. Databases including PubMed, Scopus, Google scholar, and Science Direct were searched from 1995 until May 2017 using the definitive keywords. Searching was limited to articles with English language. All of the relevant human and animal studies and also in vitro studies were included. Review articles, abstract in congress, and also other varieties of ginger were excluded. Eligibility of included articles were evaluated by 3 reviewers, which also extracted data. Articles were critically assessed individually for possible risk of bias. Twenty-seven articles (6 in vitro, 17 animal, and 4 human studies) were reviewed. Most of the experimental studies supported the weight lowering effect of ginger extract or powder in obese animal models, whereas the results of the available limited clinical studies showed no changes or slight changes of anthropometric measurements and body composition in subjects with obesity. Ginger could modulate obesity through various potential mechanisms including increasing thermogenesis, increasing lipolysis, suppression of lipogenesis, inhibition of intestinal fat absorption, and controlling appetite. This review article provides some convincing evidence to support the efficacy of ginger in obesity management and demonstrates the importance of future clinical trials.},

Moxibustion is widely accepted in East Asia as a treatment for cognitive impairment. This systematic review aimed to verify the efficacy and underlying mechanism of moxibustion in treating cognitive impairment. METHODS: Sixteen trials involving 324 animals obtained from MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane library, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wan-Fang, Cqvip, the Korean Studies Information Service System, and the Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System met the inclusion criteria. We extracted the results of behavioral tests and immunohistochemical biomarkers from the included articles and evaluated the risk of bias and reporting quality. RESULTS: The moxibustion group showed significantly decreased escape latency, increased crossing times, and prolonged dwelling times in the Morris water maze test. There was a significantly enhanced latency period and reduced error time in the step-down test and nerve behavior score. The effects of moxibustion were found to be mediated by suppression of oxidative stress and apoptosis, modulation of inflammation and Aβ genesis activation of vascular endothelial growth factor, and adjustment of metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty acid metabolism. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of moxibustion on cognitive impairment and suggested the putative mechanism. However, considering the small number of included studies, high bias risk, low reporting quality, and the limitations of animal experimentation, our results need to be confirmed by more detailed studies.},

	abstract = {Novel, non-coevolved associations between introduced plants and native insect herbivores may lead to changes in trophic interactions in native communities, as well as to substantial economic problems. Although some studies in invasion ecology demonstrated that native herbivores can preferentially feed on introduced plants and therefore contribute to the biotic resistance of native communities to plant invasions, the role of acridid grasshoppers as native generalist insect herbivores is largely overlooked. This systematic review aimed to identify patterns of grasshopper feeding preferences for native versus introduced plants and, consequently, a potential of grasshoppers to provide biotic resistance of native communities. The analysis of 63 records of feeding preference trials for 28 North-American grasshopper species (retrieved from 2146 studies published during 1967-2017) has demonstrated a preference of grasshoppers for introduced host plants, and identified 12 preferred introduced plants with high or middle invasive ranks. A significant effect of the life stage (p{\textless}0.001), but not the experimental environment, plant material, and measurements, on grasshopper preferences for introduced plants was also detected. Overall, results suggest a potential of acridid grasshoppers to contribute to the biotic resistance of native communities. The review also provides methodological recommendations for future experimental studies on grasshopper-host plant interactions.},

	abstract = {To better understand how relevant intensive systems' characteristics simultaneously affect the performance and welfare of broiler chickens, a meta-analysis of recent literature was carried out. The study determined the effects of gender, genetics, experimental initial age (EIA, d), stocking density (SD; kg/m2), group size (GS; n), bedding material (yes/no), duration of photoperiod (DP; h), divided scotoperiod (yes/no), feeding phases (1/2/3/{\textgreater}3), environmental control (EC; yes/no), environmental enrichment (yes/no), use of vaccines and other medications (yes/no), experimental duration (d), and relevant 2-way interactions on average daily gain (g/d), average daily feed intake (g/d), FCR (g: g), mortality (\%), behavior (\%), and gait score (mean value). Predictive equations for response variables were calculated using multiple regression models including a random experiment effect. Among other results, EIA × SD interaction indicated that relatively high SD may improve FCR at older ages, but parallel increased mortality would pose concerns about the actual productive benefits and welfare. Combining large GS and relatively low SD seem to improve performance and decrease flock disturbance. They would also increase leg problems, and so their actual benefits on welfare remain unclear. A gradual increase in FCR seems to occur with longer DP at older EIA (EIA × DP interaction), highlighting the importance of adapting light programs to flock age to optimize performance. The SD × DP and GS × DP interactions predicted increased FCR for longer DP at low SD or large GS, that is, with more effective space available. Longer DP combined with low SD or large GS would overall promote enhanced leg conditions, and therefore welfare. Predictions would not support scotoperiod division from both performance and welfare perspectives. The SD × EC interaction indicated that EC would benefit chicken performance at low SD, although EC would seem to increase leg problems. Our study highlights the complex, interactive nature of production systems' characteristics on broiler chicken performance and welfare.},

St John's wort (SJW), Hypericum perforatum, is a common remedy for mild depression, a problem prevalent in this population.

The objective of this study is to systematically review rodent studies assessing the safety of SJW during the perinatal period. A literature search to November 10, 2017, identified 10 rodent studies that met a priori inclusion criteria. Study quality was evaluated according to both the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation tool for assessing bias and recommendations for appropriate reporting of herbal medicine research. Significant methodological limitations were found in each of the studies reviewed. These limitations include the lack of botanical verification and omission of extract characterization, inadequate explanation of dosage rationale, and absence of bias limiting protocols. Critical appraisal with contemporary tools indicates that each of the reviewed studies lacks appropriate rigour, rendering the results unreliable. Despite this, these papers are used in the rationale for recommending or contraindicating SJW during pregnancy and lactation.},

(Fluted pumpkin) is cucurbitaceous vegetable grown in West Africa, particularly in Nigeria for its leaves and seeds. The curative properties of fluted pumpkin are popular in Nigerian folklore medicine, and several investigators have validated these therapeutic effects using animal models. The aim of this work therefore, was to review publicly available literature on the pharmacotherapeutic activities of T. occidentalis. Searches were performed on PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar for related studies, with search dates set between 1990 and 2018. A total of 499 articles were retrieved and analyzed, with 38 studies ultimately retained. Studies contained in this review were carried out in Nigeria, across different locations. 13 categories of pharmacological activities for fluted pumpkin were documented after analyzing full texts of the articles retained. T. occidentalis offers myriad of healing properties that can be explored by pharmaceutical industries. As the search for potent drugs from botanical sources continues, there is need for future investigations to isolate and characterize pharmacologically active agents that confer medicinal properties on fluted pumpkin, as well as elucidate the structures of these agents and pathways by which they exert their healing properties.},

The occurrence of Escherichia coli in foods of animal origin in Ethiopia is arguably high due to many reasons like illegal slaughtering of animals in open fields, unhygienic slaughter practices in the abattoirs, and the risk of disease due to this organism is high because of a widespread tradition of raw meat consumption. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to pool estimates of the prevalence of the organism in different foods of animal origin which is the first of its kind in the country. The literature search was conducted to identify all published articles reporting the prevalence of Escherichia coli in foods of animal origin. From all screened articles, nine studies were eligible for final systematic review and meta-analysis. Because substantial heterogeneity was expected, random-effects meta-analyses were carried out to pool the prevalence of the organism from different foods of animal origin. Prevalence of the organism was found to be 4\% (95\% CI = 3\%-5\%) in foods of animal origin. This systematic review and meta-analysis showed the level of contamination of foods of animal origin in Ethiopia is high indicating the need for immediate planning of mitigation strategies and detection methods to reduce its level and impact throughout the country.},

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) was conducted to identify articles from inception until January 2021, utilizing six databases. Controlled trials that compared the effects of different protein types were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis. Quality assessment and risk of bias of the included articles were assessed by using Cochrane risk of bias instrument and ROBINS-I. Out of the 10 studies that met the criteria, there was a decreasing trend in CRP levels when consuming plant proteins compared to animal proteins among non-dialysis participants. There was a statistically significant decrease when comparing animal proteins to unspecified proteins in CRP levels among dialysis participants [Hedges' g = 2.11; 95\% CI 1.12, 3.11; p ≤ 0.001], favoring unspecified proteins. Furthermore, animal proteins (eggs, red meat) showed increasing trends in CRP levels compared to whey protein isolate. Caution must be considered regarding these results as controlled, non-randomized, trials were included in the analysis, which may have contributed to high risk of bias. Future research should focus on protein types and the impact they have on kidney disease progression and inflammation markers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Scabies is an infectious disease that affects the skin caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei and it transmitted through close personal contact. Even though it is easily treatable disease, its prevalence is high and continuous as neglected tropical disease of resource-poor settings, and particularly affects young age groups. Despite of these facts, studies conducted in Ethiopia regarding to the prevalence and associated factors for scabies infestation have been highly variable and didn't well compiled. Due to that, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimates the overall prevalence of scabies and associated factors in all age groups in Ethiopia. METHODS: International databases (PubMed/PMC/Midline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Google and Science Direct) were systematically searched from December 1, 2019, to January 18, 2020. All observational studies noted the prevalence of human scabies and associated factors in Ethiopia were included. Two authors (AG and G.T) independently extracted all necessary data using a standardized data extraction format. The data which is extracted each study were analyzed using STATA Version 14.1. Heterogeneity among the included studies was assessed through the Cochrane Q test statistics and I(2) test. Lastly, a random effects meta-analysis model was computed to fix overall prevalence and associated factors of scabies. RESULTS: Twelve studies were included in this meta-analysis after 410 articles retrieved. Of these, eight studies were analyzed for prevalence estimation. The overall prevalence of scabies infestation was 14.5\% (95\%CI: 1.5, 27.6\%) in Ethiopia. Furthermore, the subgroup analysis revealed the highest prevalence was 19.6\% in Amhara region. A person from a large family size (OR: 3.1, 95\% CI: 1.76, 5.67), and sharing a bed (OR: 3.59, 95\%CI: 2.88, 4.47) were significantly associated with scabies. CONCLUSION: This study revealed the prevalence of scabies infestation was 14.5\% in Ethiopia which was high. Persons from high family size and any contact with scabies case were factors associated with scabies.},

Some strategies are used to maintain the well-being of zoo animals at high levels, such as environmental enrichment. Environmental enrichment consists of inserting stimuli into the animals' enclosures so that they have the opportunity to exhibit behaviors that are closer to the natural, improving their physical and psychological health. The present study aimed to evaluate, through a bibliometric analysis, how Brazilian zoos have used the technique of environmental enrichment to improve the welfare of their animals, as well as to list gaps that may guide future studies with this theme by the managers/Zoo technicians and researchers. The data were collected on three databases: The Web of Science copyright , Plataforma CAPES copyright and Google Scholar copyright . The keywords used for searching for articles in these databases were: "environmental enrichment, zoo, Brazil". The survey was performed from 1945 until 2016. Fifty-two studies, which began in 2006, were evaluated; most of them in zoos in the Southeast of Brazil, with carnivores and primates, and using more than one type of environmental enrichment. Most of the studies was behaviorally evaluated and showed positive effects to the animals. We conclude that studies on the effects of environmental enrichment in the country are still incipient, although they are in rapid growth. Environmental enrichment studies should: consider a greater number of animal species; be delineated with quality, especially concerning the sample size; and be performed by more zoos in Brazil. Finally, studies should be disseminated in quality scientific communication media, so that they can be replicated not only in Brazil but also in zoos around the world.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The system of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated proteins (cas) is a new technology that allows easier manipulation of the genome. Its potential to edit genes opened a new door in treatment development for incurable neurological monogenic diseases (NMGDs). The aim of this systematic review was to summarise the findings on the current development of CRISPR-cas for therapeutic purposes in the most frequent NMGDs and provide critical assessment. METHODS AND DATA ACQUISITION: We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, looking for original studies on the use of CRISPR-cas to edit pathogenic variants in models of the most frequent NMGDs, until end of 2017. We included all the studies that met the following criteria: 1. Peer-reviewed study report with explicitly described experimental designs; 2. In vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo study using human or other animal biological systems (including cells, tissues, organs, organisms); 3. focusing on CRISPR as the gene-editing method of choice; and 5. featured at least one NMGD. RESULTS: We obtained 404 papers from MEDLINE and 513 from EMBASE. After removing the duplicates, we screened 490 papers by title and abstract and assessed them for eligibility. After reading 50 full-text papers, we finally selected 42 for the review. DISCUSSION: Here we give a systematic summary on the preclinical development of CRISPR-cas for therapeutic purposes in NMGDs. Furthermore, we address the clinical interpretability of the findings, giving a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) paves the way forward, with 26 out of 42 studies reporting different strategies on DMD gene editing in different models of the disease. Most of the strategies aimed for permanent exon skipping by deletion with CRISPR-cas. Successful silencing of the mHTT gene with CRISPR-cas led to successful reversal of the neurotoxic effects in the striatum of mouse models of Huntington's disease. Many other strategies have been explored, including epigenetic regulation of gene expression, in cellular and animal models of: myotonic dystrophy, Fraxile X syndrome, ataxias, and other less frequent dystrophies. Still, before even considering the clinical application of CRISPR-cas, three major bottlenecks need to be addressed: efficacy, safety, and delivery of the systems. This requires a collaborative approach in the research community, while having ethical considerations in mind.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Cultural competency is a cornerstone of patient-centered health care. Religious doctrines may define appropriate consumption or use of certain animals and forbid use of others. Many medications contain ingredients that are animal-derived; these medications may be unacceptable to individual patients within the context of their religious beliefs and lifestyle choices. Knowledge of animal-derived medications as a component of cultural competency can facilitate a dialogue that shifts focus from the group to the individual, away from cultural competency toward cultural humility, and away from a paternalistic provider/patient dynamic toward one of partnership. OBJECTIVES: To explore how animal-derived drug components may impact medication selection and acceptability from the perspective of patients, physicians, and religious leaders as evidenced by studies that explore the question via survey or questionnaire. A secondary objective is to use the context of animal-derived drug products as a component of cultural competency to build a framework supporting the development of cultural humility. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in the PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, and ProQuest databases using combinations of the following terms: "medication selection," "medication," "adherence," "pharmaceutical preparations," "religion and medicine," "religion," "animal," "dietary," "porcine," and "bovine." Studies that reported using surveys or questionnaires to examine patient, physician, or religious leader perspective on animal-derived medications published in English between 1990 and 2020 were included. Review articles, opinion pieces, case reports, surveys of persons other than patients, religious leaders, or physicians, and studies published in languages other than English were excluded. Three authors independently reviewed articles to extract information pertaining to perspectives on animal-based medication ingredients. RESULTS: Eight studies meeting the described criteria were found that queried beliefs or knowledge of patients, religious leaders, or physicians regarding medications and medical products of biologic origin. Those studies are described in full in this review. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of animal-derived ingredients may help open conversations with patients around spiritual history and cultural competency, particularly for those patients belonging to religious sects with doctrines that define appropriate use of human- or animal-derived products. Further formal study is needed to explore more fully the extent to which religious beliefs may impact selection of animal- or human-derived medications. Guidelines developed from this knowledge may aid in identifying individual patients with whom the discussion may be particularly relevant. More studies are needed to quantify and qualify beliefs regarding animal-derived medication constituents.},

	abstract = {In humans, the majority of sustained traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are classified as 'mild' and most often a result of a closed head injury (CHI). The effects of a non-penetrating CHI are not benign and may lead to chronic pathology and behavioral dysfunction, which could be worsened by repeated head injury. Clinical-neuropathological correlation studies provide evidence that conversion of tau into abnormally phosphorylated proteotoxic intermediates (p-tau) could be part of the pathophysiology triggered by a single TBI and enhanced by repeated TBIs. However, the link between p-tau and CHI in rodents remains controversial. To address this question experimentally, we induced a single CHI or two CHIs to WT or rTg4510 mice. We found that 2× CHI increased tau phosphorylation in WT mice and rTg4510 mice. Behavioral characterization in WT mice found chronic deficits in the radial arm water maze in 2× CHI mice that had partially resolved in the 1× CHI mice. Moreover, using Manganese-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging with R1 mapping - a novel functional neuroimaging technique - we found greater deficits in the rTg4510 mice following 2× CHI compared to 1× CHI. To integrate our findings with prior work in the field, we conducted a systematic review of rodent mild repetitive CHI studies. Following Prisma guidelines, we identified 25 original peer-reviewed papers. Results from our experiments, as well as our systematic review, provide compelling evidence that tau phosphorylation is modified by experimental mild TBI studies; however, changes in p-tau levels are not universally reported. Together, our results provide evidence that repetitive TBIs can result in worse and more persistent neurological deficits compared to a single TBI, but the direct link between the worsened outcome and elevated p-tau could not be established.},

	abstract = {Wild animals are the source of many pathogens of livestock and humans. Concerns about the potential transmission of economically important and zoonotic diseases from wildlife have led to increased surveillance at the livestock-wildlife interface. Knowledge of the types, frequency and duration of contacts between livestock and wildlife is necessary to identify risk factors for disease transmission and to design possible mitigation strategies. Observing the behaviour of many wildlife species is challenging due to their cryptic nature and avoidance of humans, meaning there are relatively few studies in this area. Further, a consensus on the definition of what constitutes a 'contact' between wildlife and livestock is lacking. A systematic review was conducted to investigate which livestock-wildlife contacts have been studied and why, as well as the methods used to observe each species. Over 30,000 publications were screened, of which 122 fulfilled specific criteria for inclusion in the analysis. The majority of studies examined cattle contacts with badgers or with deer; studies involving wild pig contacts with cattle or with domestic pigs were the next most frequent. There was a range of observational methods including motion-activated cameras and global positioning system collars. As a result of the wide variation and lack of consensus in the definitions of direct and indirect contacts, we developed a unified framework to define livestock-wildlife contacts that is sufficiently flexible to be applied to most wildlife and livestock species for non-vector-borne diseases. We hope this framework will help standardise the collection and reporting of contact data; a valuable step towards being able to compare the efficacy of wildlife-livestock observation methods. In doing so, it may aid the development of better disease transmission models and improve the design and effectiveness of interventions to reduce or prevent disease transmission.},

One of the genes that undergoes changes by prenatal stress (PNS) exposure, is the gene coding brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Studies have reported different patterns of change following PNS in BDNF, which emphasizes the complexity of the issue. In this review, systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL databases was performed. Primary searches resulted in 2132 studies and finally 43 studies were found to meet the inclusion criteria. Transcriptional and epigenetic changes of BDNF gene in the brain were recorded. Decreased or unchanged BDNF total mRNA and BDNF mature protein, with hypermethylation of the coding exons were the most reported changes. However, stress paradigm, gender of the fetus and the day of sacrifice were found to significantly affect the results. Hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are the most vulnerable regions. They can show long lasting and persistent transcriptional and epigenetics changes of BDNF gene following PNS. Further studies evaluating the importance of these findings in humans are essential.},

	abstract = {Low-grade canine cutaneous mast cell tumour (cMCT) with metastasis at the time of treatment is uncommonly reported, with few studies focusing on this specific clinical entity. The specific objective of this study was to systematically review the veterinary literature and perform a meta-analysis summarizing the clinical presentation, treatments reported and clinical outcomes from dogs with histologically low-grade cMCT and metastasis present at initial treatment. A total of 980 studies were screened with eight publications providing data on 121 dogs ultimately included. The most common treatments were surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy in 83/121 (69\%) dogs; combined surgery, radiation and chemotherapy in 17/121 (14\%) dogs; chemotherapy alone in 12/121 (10\%) dogs and surgery alone in 7/121 (6\%) dogs. Dogs with distant metastasis (n = 22) experienced significantly shorter survival compared with those with regional lymph node (RLN) metastasis (n = 99; median 194 vs 637 days; P {\textless} .01). Two variables were significantly associated with increased risk of death: presence of distant (vs RLN) metastasis (hazard ratio = 2.60; P {\textless} .01) and not receiving surgery as a component of treatment (hazard ratio = 3.79; P {\textless} .01). Risk of bias was judged to be low in terms of selection and performance bias but high in terms of detection and exclusion bias. In conclusion, dogs with cMCT and RLN metastasis can be expected to live significantly longer than those with distant metastasis, and surgery appears to have a role in extending survival of metastatic low-grade cMCT.},

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to quantify the overall effect of inorganic NO(3), administered via drinking water, on body weight gain in rats. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases, and the reference lists of published papers. Experiments on male rats, reported data on body weight in NO(3)-treated animals and controls, were included for quality assessment, meta-analyses, subgroup analyses, and meta-regressions. Of 173 initially obtained studies, 11 were eligible to be included in the analyses, which covered the years 2004 to 2019 and included a total of 43 intervention (n=395) and 43 control (n=395) arms. Overall, the final body weights were significantly lower in the NO(3)-supplemented groups compared to controls (WMD= -16.8 g, 95 \% CI= -27.38, -6.24; P=0.002). Doses of NO(3) higher than the median ({\textgreater} 72.94 mg L(-1) d(-1)) and longer NO(3) exposure ({\textgreater} 8 weeks) resulted in greater mean differences (WMD= -31.92 g, 95 \% CI= -52.90, -10.94 and WMD= -23.16 g, 95 \% CI= -35.64, -10.68 g). After exclusion of experiments using high doses of NO(3) ({\textgreater} 400 mg L(-1) d(-1)), the overall mean differences in body weights between the groups decreased by approximately 37 \% but remained statistically significant (WMD= -10.11 g, 95 \% CI= -19.04, -1.19, P=0.026). Mean changes in body weight were affected by age, baseline values in body weight, and the duration of the studies. These preliminary experimental findings strongly support the hypothesis that NO(3) can be considered as a natural anti-obesity agent.},

This could be attributed to induction of neuroapoptosis and inhibition of neurogenesis by several mechanisms, with a pivotal role of microRNAs in this milieu. MicroRNAs are critical regulators of gene expression that are differentially expressed in response to internal and external environmental stimuli, including general anesthetics. Through this systematic review, we aimed at summarizing the current knowledge apropos of the roles and implications of deregulated microRNAs pertaining to anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity in animal models and derived neuronal cultures. OVID/Medline and PubMed databases were lastly searched on April 1st, 2019, using the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) or Title/Abstract words ("microRNA" and "anesthesia"), to identify all published research studies on microRNAs and anesthesia. During the review process, data abstraction and methodological assessment was done by independent groups of reviewers. In total, 29 studies were recognized to be eligible and were thus involved in this systematic review. Anesthetic agents studied included sevoflurane, isoflurane, propofol, bupivacaine, and ketamine. More than 40 microRNAs were identified to have regulatory roles in anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity. This field of study still comprises several gaps that should be filled by conducting basic, clinical, and translational research in the future to decipher the exact role of microRNAs and their functions in the context of anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of fascioliasis in humans, cattle, sheep, and goats, done by a systematic review in Iran. METHODS: Fifty articles were extracted including Iranian papers such as Google scholar, Magiran, Iran Medex, SID, and Pubmed. Out of these, 21 articles were selected for meta-analysis. Essential information for meta-analysis was extracted from papers and archived in Excel software for calculating by statistical analysis. The variance of each study was obtained using the binomial distribution. Heterogeneity of the studies was surveyed using I2 index. Data were analyzed using a random effect model. RESULTS: Of 21 collected papers, 1,275,506 samples from cow (507,152), sheep (454,882), goat (207,925), and human (105,547) had been surveyed in Iran. Eight studies were conducted on humans and 13 on animals. The prevalence rate obtained in humans was 3\% with a confidence interval (CI) of 95\% (1\%-7\%). Prevalence rate obtained in cows, sheep, and goats was 13\% with CI of 95\% (10\%-16\%). The highest level of prevalence was reported from cities in the North in animals with a prevalence of 14\%. The highest level of prevalence was reported from Gilan in humans with a prevalence of 0.1\%. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of the Fascioliasis in Iran has reduced in recent years, But the importance of the disease has not reduced and there is a possibility of an epidemic. Furthermore, in many cities of Iran, there is no study on the disease.},

	abstract = {Background and Purpose- Brain electrical stimulation, widely studied to facilitate recovery from stroke, has also been reported to confer direct neuroprotection in preclinical models of acute cerebral ischemia. Systematic review of controlled preclinical acute cerebral ischemia studies would aid in planning for initial human clinical trials. Methods- A systematic Medline search identified controlled, preclinical studies of central nervous system electrical stimulation in acute cerebral ischemia. Studies were categorized among 6 stimulation strategies. Three strategies applied different stimulation types to tissues within the ischemic zone (cathodal hemispheric stimulation [CHS], anodal hemispheric stimulation, and pulsed hemispheric stimulation), and 3 strategies applied deep brain stimulation to different neuronal targets remote from the ischemic zone (fastigial nucleus stimulation, subthalamic vasodilator area stimulation, and dorsal periaqueductal gray stimulation). Random-effects meta-analysis assessed electrical stimulation modification of final infarct volume. Study-level risk of bias and intervention-level readiness-for-translation were assessed using formal rating scales. Results- Systematic search identified 28 experiments in 21 studies, including a total of 350 animals, of electrical stimulation in preclinical acute cerebral ischemia. Overall, in animals undergoing electrical stimulation, final infarct volumes were reduced by 37\% (95\% CI, 34\%-40\%; P{\textless}0.001), compared with control. There was evidence of heterogeneity of efficacy among stimulation strategies (I(2)=93.1\%, P(heterogeneity){\textless}0.001). Among the within-ischemic zone stimulation strategies, only CHS significantly reduced the infarct volume (27 \%; 95\% CI, 22\%-33\%; P{\textless}0.001); among the remote-from ischemic zone approaches, all (fastigial nucleus stimulation, subthalamic vasodilator area stimulation, and dorsal periaqueductal gray stimulation) reduced infarct volumes by approximately half. On formal rating scales, CHS studies had the lowest risk of bias, and CHS had the highest overall quality of intervention-level evidence supporting readiness to proceed to clinical testing. Conclusions- Electrical stimulation reduces final infarct volume across preclinical studies. CHS shows the most robust evidence and is potentially appropriate for progression to early-stage human clinical trial testing as a promising neuroprotective intervention.},

Information on the bibliographic data, anthelmintic drugs, animals, reduction method, days after application, parasite genera, type of application, and dosage were collected. The final data base was composed of 70 articles published between 1986 and 2016 with a total of 8,976 animals. The mode of application interfered with the efficacy of anthelmintic drugs in cattle (P{\textless}0.05); oral application was superior to injectable and pour-on drugs. The combined use of drugs was superior to single macrocyclic lactones including ivermectin (P{\textless}0.05), in this way the combined use was more effective than the single use of drugs for the control of gastro-intestinal nematodes in cattle (P{\textless}0.05). Nematode genera in the abomasum (Ostertagia spp., Haemonchus spp.) and intestine (Cooperia spp.) were evaluated. Levamisole had a greater efficacy for Cooperia spp. than Ostertagia spp. (P{\textless}0.05); ivermectin had a greater efficacy for Ostertagia spp. than Haemonchus spp. (P{\textless}0.05); doramectin had a greater efficacy for Ostertagia spp. than Cooperia spp. (P{\textless}0.05). Dosing in larger quantities and according to the manufacturer's recommendation was most efficient, and the dose limiting species differed between substance classes. The test based on the count of eggs per gram of faeces indicated a reduced efficacy of the drug as days passed following treatment. The forest plot did not show a difference (P{\textgreater}0.05) between interventions (resistance and efficacy). The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that anthelmintic resistance in cattle is present on several continents. Therefore, there is a need to replace the schemes based on the exclusive use of drugs in order to decrease the selection pressure.},

Meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled Odds Ratio and 95\% Confidence Intervals. Of the 1504 abstracts screened for eligibility, 80 were deemed relevant for full publication review. Thirteen publications were included in the qualitative synthesis and assessed for systematic bias. Only five studies were included in the quantitative analysis because they showed a low risk of producing biased results in all the parameters. The forest plot indicated four studies that discuss anthelmintic resistance (P{\textless}0.05), while only one study did not discuss anthelmintic resistance (P{\textless}0.05). The pooled estimate showed 0.59 (95\% Confidence intervals: 0.08, 0.47) times higher odds for studies that report anthelmintic resistance than for studies reporting efficacious anthelmintic treatment, with significant and substantially low heterogeneity (I2=25\%). Anthelmintic resistance to injectable macrocyclic lactones is a reality. There are need to improve methodological reporting in studies, which is a problem for investigations that involves systematic review and meta-analysis (SR-MA).},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Extracellular vesicles from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC-EVs) have shown promise in wound healing. Their use in diabetic wounds specifically, however, remains pre-clinical and their efficacy remains uncertain less clear. A systematic review of preclinical studies is needed to determine the efficacy of MSC-EVs in the treatment of diabetic wounds to accelerate the clinical translation of this cell-based therapy. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched (to June 23, 2020). All English-language, full-text, controlled interventional studies comparing MSC-EVs to placebo or a "no treatment" arm in animal models of diabetic wounds were included. Study outcomes, including wound closure (primary outcome), scar width, blood vessel number and density, and re-epithelialisation were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. Risk of bias (ROB) was assessed using the SYRCLE tool for pre-clinical animal studies. RESULTS: A total of 313 unique records were identified from our search, with 10 full text articles satisfying inclusion criteria (n = 136 animals). The administration of MSC-EVs improved closure of diabetic wounds compared to controls with a large observed effect (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) 5.48, 95\% Confidence Interval (CI) 3.55-8.13). Healing was further enhanced using MSC-EVs enriched in non-coding RNAs or microRNAs compared to controls (SMD 9.89, 95\%CI 7.32-12.46). Other outcomes, such as blood vessel density and number, scar width, and re-epithelialisation were improved with the administration of MSC-EVs, with a large effect. ROB across studies was unclear. CONCLUSION: MSC-EVs, particularly following enrichment for specific RNAs, are a promising treatment for diabetic wounds in pre-clinical studies and translation to the clinical domain appears warranted.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) have been implicated in the regulation of tumor growth. Studies remain preclinical with effects ranging from inhibition of tumor growth to cancer progression. A systematic review and meta-analysis is needed to clarify the effect of MSC-EVs on tumor growth to facilitate potential translation to clinical trials. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature (MEDLINE, Embase, and BIOSIS databases to June 1, 2019) identified all pre-clinical controlled studies investigating the effect of MSC-EVs on tumor growth. Study selection and data extraction were performed in duplicate. Potential risk of bias was assessed using the SYRCLE tool. A random effects meta-analysis of reduction in tumor weight/volume (primary outcome) was performed. RESULTS: We identified 29 articles and 22 reported data on tumor responses that were included for meta-analysis. Studies were associated with unclear risk of bias in a large proportion of domains in accordance with the SYRCLE tool for determining risk of bias in preclinical studies. A high risk of bias was not identified in any study. MSC-EVs had a mixed response on tumor progression with some studies reporting inhibition of tumor growth and others reporting tumor progression. Overall, MSC-EVs exerted a non-significant reduction in tumor growth compared to controls (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.80, 95 \% CI -1.64 to 0.03, p = 0.06, I(2) = 87 \%). Some studies reported increased tumor growth which aligned with their stated hypothesis and some interrogated mechanisms in cancer biology. EVs isolated from MSCs that overexpressed anti-tumor RNAs were associated with significant tumor reduction in meta-analysis (SMD - 2.40, 95 \% CI -3.36 to -1.44, p {\textless} 0.001). Heterogeneity between studies was observed and included aspects of study design such as enrichment of MSC-EVs with specific anti-tumor molecules, tissue source of MSCs, method of EV isolation, characterization of MSCs and EVs, dosage and administration schedules, and tissue type and source of tumor cells studied. CONCLUSIONS: MSC-EVs are associated with mixed effects on tumor growth in animal models of cancer. In studies where anti-tumor RNAs are packaged in EVs, a significant reduction in tumor growth was observed. Reducing heterogeneity in study design may accelerate our understanding of the potential effects of MSC-EVs on cancer.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgical specialists in plastic, head and neck, hand, trauma surgery, and emergency medicine physicians bear the burden of treating the most serious injuries caused by animals. Most of these incidents result from an attack by a known dog, and breed has been proposed, but not proven, to be a controllable factor. The authors summarize the peer-reviewed literature on dog bites in the United States, specifically as related to the breeds implicated. METHODS: A systematic review of all peer-reviewed publications reporting on dog bites in the United States was performed. MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library searches were conducted through May 8, 2018, for studies from the United States implicating a specific dog breed as responsible. RESULTS: Forty-one articles met inclusion criteria, the majority of which were single-institution retrospective reviews. Main outcomes were any dog bite reported in the peer-reviewed literature where a specific breed was implicated. Secondary measures included dog bites reported in areas where breed-specific legislation was enacted. The most common pure breed identified was German Shepherd, followed by Pit Bull-type breeds (i.e., American Staffordshire Terrier, American Pit Bull Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, American Bully), Labrador, Collie, and Rottweiler, respectively. Pit bull-type and German Shepherd breeds are consistently implicated for causing the most serious injuries to patients in the United States across heterogeneous populations, and this remained consistent across multiple decades. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' results indicate that German Shepherd and Pit Bull-type breeds account for the largest subset of pure breeds implicated in severe dog bites inflicted on humans in the medical literature. The role and complexity of mentioning breed in relation to human injuries are also discussed.},

	abstract = {The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) both recognize the importance of veterinary services in controlling zoonotic diseases, in preventing human injury, and in protecting the welfare of non-human animals. Furthermore, both organizations recommend regular evaluations of veterinary programs. Accordingly, we conducted a scoping review to collate the available peer-reviewed evaluations of subsidized small animal veterinary services in terms of the effects on animal and public health. We summarized the evaluation methods used, identified key journals in this disparate literature, and identified gaps in knowledge. CAB Abstracts, PubMed, and Scopus were searched, yielding 1441 records published between 2009 and 2016 for initial screening. After examining titles and keywords, abstracts, and finally full articles, we identified 32 relevant papers that evaluated 27 distinct programs. The global distribution was broad, with half of the papers evaluating programs in Africa or Asia, all of which were rabies vaccination programs targeting dogs. Three program evaluation categories were identified: zoonotic disease prevention (9 papers), animal welfare and control (9 papers), and One Health promotion (14 papers). Nearly three-quarters (72\%) of the papers used more than one method for collecting data. The most common data sources were questionnaires (22 papers) and administrative records, such as medical charts (21 papers). The most common indicators used for animal health-related program assessments were the number of animals reached by the program (27 papers) and any changes in animal population demographics (22 papers). These indicators were found in all three types of program evaluations (i.e., zoonotic disease prevention, animal welfare/control, and One Health promotion). For public health-related program assessments, the most common indicators consisted of determining barriers to a veterinary program's success (13 papers), followed by costs of a program (11 papers), changes in perceived threats or nuisances (11 papers), and community knowledge of a zoonotic disease (11 papers). The small number of papers identified in this review, n=32, underscores that comprehensive evaluations of subsidized veterinary services are uncommon in the peer-reviewed literature. Yet, when performed, such evaluations can help guide program delivery and future research. Given the high stakes and the high costs of subsidized veterinary services, greater efforts in program evaluation are warranted.},

Recent research has demonstrated the potential of natural products, such as polyphenol-rich fruit extracts, for use in the treatment of obesity. The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the metabolic effects of polyphenol-rich fruit extracts on diet-induced obesity (DIO) in rodents. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases to identify preclinical studies that assessed polyphenol-rich fruit extracts compared to placebo on DIO in rodents in December 2018. Two researchers selected the studies, extracted the data, and assessed the quality of studies. Meta-analyses of standardized mean difference (SMD) of outcomes were calculated in Stata 11, and causes of heterogeneity were assessed by meta-regression. RESULTS: We included 14 studies in the systematic review and 13 studies with 21 matched groups in the metaanalysis. Polyphenol-rich fruit extracts reduced the total body weight gain (SMD = -1.48; confidence interval: - 1.95, -1.01), energy intake (SMD = -0.42; -0.67, -0.17), visceral adipose tissue (SMD = -0.96; -1.25, -0.66), triglycerides (SMD = -1.00; -1.39, -0.62), cholesterol (SMD = -1.18, -1.66, -0.69), LDL- c (SMD = -1.15; -1.65, - 0.65), fasting glucose (SMD = -1.05; -1.65, -0.46), and fasting insulin (SMD = -1.40; -1.80, -1.00) when compared to vehicle.

This semi-systematic review synthesizes the evidence published in the last 30 years, worldwide, to address two main questions "what do farmers think (farmer's general view) about farm animal welfare?" and "what are the factors that influence their thinking?". A thematic analysis was conducted to identify factors that influenced the implementation of FAW innovation. The main outcomes extracted from 96 peer-reviewed publications on a range of livestock species identified 11 internal factors including farmer knowledge, empathy, personality, values, and human-animal bond; 15 external factors including economic advantages, communication, time and labor influenced the perception of FAW. Farmers' knowledge and cost implications of FAW were the most frequently reported factors. The review further highlights the need for promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and stakeholder participation. This study suggests strategies to improve FAW, including tools to support behavioral changes amongst farmers.},

We aimed to conduct the systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the epidemiological data on prevalence of Cryptococcus species complexes in trees and their surroundings, bird guano and secretions, animals, and highlight the reported episodes of cryptococcosis in Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Proquest, Google Scholar, Embase, and the ISI Web of Science, as well as the national databases, from January 1969 to October 2019 were searched. Furthermore, gray literature (e.g., thesis, congress abstracts) was evaluated using Iran Doc and www.thesis. RESEARCH: ac.ir. Search process was accomplished on English or Persian language articles using the following keywords: "Cryptococcus", "Cryptococcosis", "invasive fungal infection", "Humans", "Birds", "Pigeon", "Animals", "Tree", "Eucalyptus", and "Iran", both alone and in combination. RESULTS: Overall 36 studies were eligible regarding Cryptococcus and cryptococcosis in Iran. The total prevalence rates of Cryptococcus species in the tree was 4.7\% (95\% CI: 2.3-7.8), and in bird guano was 20.4\% (95\% CI: 10.7-32.2). Cryptococcosis in animal, and human were 1.7\% (95\% CI: 0.01-5.1), and 2.8\% (95\% CI: 0.7v6.1), respectively. The highest prevalence of Cryptococcus in the trees (14.6\%), and bird guano (89.4\%) in Khorasan, animals (8.9\%) in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, and human (4.4\%) in Mazandaran provinces were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Given the significant risk of Cryptococcus species for susceptible humans, mainly HIV-infected patients, it seems quite necessary to adopt concrete preventive strategies to pinpoint the environmental habitats of this yeast.},

The research was done in the Thermal Comfort Laboratory at FEAGRI- UNICAMP, and the concept of the systematic review was applied. The research criterion was initially defined (the keywords) aiming to identify and evaluate the variables that describe the experimental characteristics and the animals. The primary keywords identified were: broiler chicken from commercial strains, broiler production, rearing conditions, thermal environment, air quality, acoustic environment, light intensity, management, and heat stress. Those were the key words searched in the database of the online libraries. The selected articles were registered into an electronic spreadsheet with the title, the name of the authors, year of publication, language, the journal where it was published, the keyword, the period when the research was done, source/database, and the abstract. A total of 167 articles were selected, and only 34 were added to the review. The use of the systematic review of the literature allowed identifying the main variables that positively influence the broiler performance, such as the temperature near the thermal comfort, the use of roof lining, besides the use of adiabatic cooling and cast bricks in the laterals. The presence of positive ventilation, as well as the use of yellow curtains and constant lighting, has also influenced a better performance to broilers.},

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common; however, effective treatments of the secondary brain injury are scarce. Melatonin is a potent, nonselective neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory agent that is showing promising results in neonatal brain injury. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the pre-clinical and clinical literature on the effectiveness of melatonin in improving outcome after TBI. Using the systematic review protocol for animal intervention studies (SYRCLE) and Cochrane methodology for clinical studies, a search of English-language articles was performed. Eligible studies were identified and data were extracted. Quality assessment was performed using the SYRCLE risk of bias tool. Meta-analyses were performed using standardized mean differences (SMD). Seventeen studies (15 pre-clinical, 2 clinical) met inclusion criteria. There was heterogeneity in the studies, and all had moderate-to-low risk of bias. Meta-analysis of pre-clinical data revealed an overall positive effect on neurobehavioural outcome with SMD of 1.51 (95\% CI: 1.06-1.96). Melatonin treatment had a favorable effect on neurological status, by an SMD of 1.35 (95\% CI: 0.83-1.88), and on cognition by an SMD of 1.16 (95\% CI: 0.4-1.92). Melatonin decreased the size of the contusion by an SMD of 2.22 (95\% CI: 0.8--3.59) and of cerebral edema by an SMD of 1.91 (95\% CI: 1.08-2.74). Only two clinical studies were identified. They were of low quality, were used for symptom management, and were of uncertain significance. In conclusion, there is evidence that melatonin treatment after TBI significantly improves both behavioral outcomes and pathological outcomes; however, significant research gaps exist, especially in clinical populations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neoangiogenesis is one of the key pathogenetic mechanisms in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Modulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) seems to be a possible adjuvant therapy for HCC, due to the anti-angiogenic and anti-fibrogenic activity of these drugs. AIM: To elucidate the role of ARBs and ACE-Is in HCC. METHODS: We performed an electronic search of the literature using the most accessed online databases (PubMed, Cochrane library, Scopus and Web of Science), entering the query terms "angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors" OR "ACE inhibitors" OR "ACE-I" AND "hepatocarcinoma*" OR "hepatocellular carcinoma; moreover "angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers" OR "ARBs" AND "hepatocarcinoma*" OR "hepatocellular carcinoma". Eligibility criteria were: (1) prospective or retrospective clinical studies; (2) epidemiological studies; and (3) experimental studies conducted in vivo or in vitro. Abstracts, conference papers, and reviews were excluded a priori. We limited our literature search to articles published in English, in peer-reviewed journals. RESULTS: Thirty-one studies were selected. Three interventional studies showed that ACE-Is had a significant protective effect on HCC recurrence only when used in combination with vitamin K or branched chain aminoacids, without a significant increase in overall survival. Of six retrospective observational studies, mainly focused on overall survival, only one demonstrated a prolonged survival in the ACE-Is group, whereas the two that also evaluated tumor recurrence showed conflicting results. All experimental studies displayed beneficial effects of RAS inhibitors on hepatocarcinogenesis. Numerous experimental studies, conducted either on animals and cell cultures, demonstrated the anti-angiogenetic and antifibrotic effect of ACE-Is and ARBs, thanks to the suppression of some cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1a, transforming growth factor-beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha. All or parts of these mechanisms were demonstrated in rodents developing fewer HCC and preneoplastic lesions after receiving such drugs. CONCLUSION: In humans, RAS inhibitors - alone or in combination - significantly suppressed the cumulative HCC recurrence, without prolonging patient survival, but some limitations intrinsic to these studies prompt further investigations.},

	abstract = {The global expansion of aquaculture has raised concerns about its environmental impacts, including effects on wildlife. Aquaculture farms are thought to repel some species and function as either attractive population sinks ('ecological traps') or population sources for others. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of empirical studies documenting interactions between aquaculture operations and vertebrate wildlife. Farms were associated with elevated local abundance and diversity of wildlife, although this overall effect was strongly driven by aggregations of wild fish at sea cages and shellfish farms (abundance: 72x; species richness: 2.0x). Birds were also more diverse at farms (1.1x), but other taxa showed variable and comparatively small effects. Larger effects were reported when researchers selected featureless or unstructured habitats as reference sites. Evidence for aggregation 'hotspots' is clear in some systems, but we cannot determine whether farms act as ecological traps for most taxa, as few studies assess either habitat preference or fitness in wildlife. Fish collected near farms were larger and heavier with no change in body condition, but also faced higher risk of disease and parasitism. Birds and mammals were frequently reported preying on stock, but little data exist on the outcomes of such interactions for birds and mammals - farms are likely to function as ecological traps for many species. We recommend researchers measure survival and reproduction in farm-associated wildlife to make direct, causal links between aquaculture and its effects on wildlife populations.},

	doi = {10.1002/syn.22103},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Environmental enrichment (EE) can be related to changes in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus of adult rodents. Exposure to EE may also induce neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG). The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the current literature on the correlation between neurogenesis and BDNF expression in the hippocampal DG region resulting from exposure to EE, which is associated with changes in memory, in rodents. METHODS: Bibliographic searches of the Medline/PubMed and ScienceDirect databases were carried out, and 334 studies were found. A predefined protocol was used and registered on PROSPERO, and 32 studies were included for qualitative synthesis. The PRISMA was used to report this systematic review. RESULTS: Most of the included studies showed that there is little evidence in the literature demonstrating that memory changes resulting from EE are dependent on BDNF expression and that there is an induction of neurogenesis in the hippocampal DG. However, the observed increase in molecular expression levels and cell proliferation is dependent on the age, the timing and duration of exposure to EE. Regarding the methodological quality of the studies, the majority presented a risk of bias due to the high variability in the age of the animals. CONCLUSION: There are few studies in the literature that correlate the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in neurogenesis in the hippocampal DG with BDNF expression in this region in rodents exposed to EE; however, there are other factors that can modulate this neurogenesis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Strongyloides stercoralis infection, a neglected tropical disease, is widely distributed. Autochthonous cases have been described in Spain, probably infected long time ago. In recent years the number of diagnosed cases has increased due to the growing number of immigrants, travelers and refugees, but endemically acquired cases in Spain remains undetermined. METHODOLOGY: We systematically searched the literature for references on endemic strongyloidiasis cases in Spain. The articles were required to describe Strongyloides stercoralis infection in at least one Spanish-born person without a history of travel to endemic areas and be published before 31st May 2018. Epidemiological data from patients was collected and described individually as well as risk factors to acquisition of the infection, diagnostic technique that lead to the diagnosis, presence of eosinophilia and clinical symptoms at diagnosis. FINDINGS: Thirty-six studies were included, describing a total of 1083 patients with an average age of 68.3 years diagnosed with endemic strongyloidiasis in Spain. The vast majority of the cases were described in the province of Valencia (n = 1049). Two hundred and eight of the 251 (82.9\%) patients in whom gender was reported were male, and most of them had current or past dedication to agriculture. Seventy percent had some kind of comorbidity. A decreasing trend in the diagnosed cases per year is observed from the end of last decade. However, there are still nefigw diagnoses of autochthonous cases of strongyloidiasis in Spain every year. CONCLUSIONS: With the data provided by this review it is likely that in Spain strongyloidiasis might have been underestimated. It is highly probable that the infection remains undiagnosed in many cases due to low clinical suspicion among Spanish population without recent travel history in which the contagion probably took place decades ago.},

	abstract = {Long-term wildlife disease research (LTWDR) and its interfaces with humans and domestic animals provide perspective to understand the diseases' main drivers and how they operate. In a systematic review, we analysed the temporal trend of the studies on LTWDR, their aims, and the hosts, pathogens and geographic areas studied. We also evaluated the added value that such studies provide. For analysis, we selected a total of 538 articles from 1993 to 2017 with a study period greater than or equal to 4 consecutive years. A marked increase in the number of studies published during the last 20 years was observed that reflects a growing awareness of the outstanding role of wildlife as a reservoir of diseases. The most studied pathogen agents were viruses (39.2\%), bacteria (38.5\%) and protozoans (15.8\%). Concerning the hosts, mammals (84.9\%), particularly ungulates (40\%) and carnivores (30.9\%), and birds (12.5\%) were the most represented in these long-term studies. Most articles reached conclusions concerning the effect of the disease on the infection/host dynamics (98.7\%) and over 40\% considered the economic consequences or proposed management and control measures. The research was mainly located in the Northern Hemisphere. While the definition of LTWDR is not only determined by the duration of the monitoring, the study must be long enough to: (a) address ecological and epidemiological questions that cannot be resolved with short-term observations or experiments, and (b) clarify the effects of different drivers. This review demonstrates that LTWDR has provided information about the causes and consequences of disease change that otherwise could not have been obtained. It may be used to inform decisions related to the emergence of disease and might help to design early warning systems of disease based on retrospective investigations.},

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the associations between dairy product consumption and CRC incidence. Summary RRs and ORs with 95\% CIs were estimated. A total of 15 cohort studies and 14 case-control studies comprising a total of {\textgreater}22,000 cases were included in the quantitative synthesis. The cohort studies showed a consistent significant decrease in CRC risk associated with higher consumption of total dairy products (RR: 0.80; 95\% CI: 0.70, 0.91) and total milk (RR: 0.82; 95\% CI: 0.76, 0.88) compared with the CRC risk associated with lower consumption. These studies also showed a significant protective association between low-fat milk consumption and CRC (RR: 0.76; 95\% CI: 0.66, 0.88), but only for colon cancer (RR: 0.73; 95\% CI: 0.61, 0.87). Cheese consumption was inversely associated with the risk of CRC (RR: 0.85; 95\% CI: 0.76, 0.96) and proximal colon cancer (RR: 0.74; 95\% CI: 0.60, 0.91). No significant associations with CRC were found for the consumption of low-fat dairy products, whole milk, fermented dairy products, or cultured milk. Most of these associations were not supported by the case-control studies. In conclusion, high consumption of total dairy products and total milk was associated with a lower risk of developing CRC at any anatomic location, including the proximal and distal colon and the rectum. Low-fat milk consumption was associated with a lower risk of CRC, but this association was restricted to colon cancer. Cheese consumption was associated with the prevention of CRC, specifically proximal colon cancer. Further studies on larger samples and with longer follow-up periods, along with appropriately designed and executed clinical trials, are warranted to determine whether dairy product consumption affects CRC development.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rhinovirus (RV) infections are the most common cause of viral upper respiratory infections (URIs), and in the majority of persons they are self-limiting. However, in others, viral URIs can progress to bacterial sinusitis and induce chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) exacerbations. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) review through April 2018 based on MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science-Science Citation Index (SCI), and Conference Proceedings Citation Index- Science (CPCI-S) using keywords: RV, respiratory virus, sinusitis, and airway epithelial cells. The goal of this systematic review was to: (1) determine the prevalence between RV and CRS, (2) study the changes that occur after experimental RV inoculation, (3) investigate the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which RV induces sinonasal inflammation, and (4) explore the treatment options available for RV-associated sinusitis. Data regarding study design, research question, intervention, subjects, outcomes, and biases was extracted. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 2395 unique abstracts, of which 614 were selected for full-text review; 147 were included in the final review. We determined that (1) the prevalence of RV infections is increased in those with CRS, (2) humans challenged in vivo with RV secrete local inflammatory mediators with radiographic mucosal thickening, (3) RV species RV-A and RV-C challenges in vitro to sinonasal epithelia produce robust cytokine responses and differential gene changes, and (4) no current therapies have produced consistent and significant resolution of disease. CONCLUSION: RV infections are common in persons with CRS, and incite inflammatory reactions that may result in CRS exacerbations and progression of disease. Further studies assessing RV species, and the host-virome response are required to develop new strategies targeting RV-induced CRS.},

	abstract = {Although East Africa is home to one of the most advanced dairy industries in Sub-Saharan Africa, regional annual milk production is insufficient to meet the demand. The challenge of increasing milk yields (MYs) among smallholder dairy cattle farmers (SDCFs) has received considerable attention and resulted in the introduction of various dairy management strategies (DMSs). Despite adoption of these DMSs, MYs remain low on-farm and there is a large discrepancy in the efficacy of DMSs across different farms. Therefore, the present study sought to: (1) identify on-farm DMSs employed by East African SDCFs to increase MYs and (2) summarize existing literature to quantify the expected MY changes associated with these identified DMSs. Data were collected through a comprehensive literature review and in-depth semi-structured interviews with 10 experts from the East African dairy sector. Meta-analysis of the literature review data was performed by deriving four multivariate regression models (i.e. models 1 to 4) that related DMSs to expected MYs. Each model differed in the weighting strategy used (e.g. number of observations and inverse of the standard errors) and the preferred model was selected based on the root estimated error variance and concordance correlation coefficient. Nine DMSs were identified, of which only adoption of improved cattle breeds and improved feeding (i.e. increasing diet quality and quantity) consistently and significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) increased daily MYs across the available studies. Improved breeds alongside adequate feeding explained ≤50\% of the daily MYs observed in the metadata while improved feeding explained ≤30\% of the daily MYs observed across the different models. Conversely, calf suckling significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) reduced MYs according to model 2. Other variables including days in milk, trial length and maximum ambient temperature (used as a proxy for heat stress) contributed significantly to decreasing MYs. These variables may explain some of the heterogeneity in MY responses to DMSs reported in the literature. Our results suggest that using improved cattle breeds alongside improved feeding is the most reliable strategy to increase MYs on-farm in East Africa. Nevertheless, these DMSs should not be considered as standalone solutions but as a pool of options that should be combined depending on the resources available to the farmer to achieve a balance between using dairy cattle genetics, proper husbandry and feeding to secure higher MYs.},

	abstract = {Glyphosate (GLY) is an herbicide widely used in agriculture. First considered as non-toxic or slightly toxic to bees, GLY and its different formulations have shown, more recently, to affect negatively the survival, development and behavior of these insects, even when used in doses and concentrations recommended by the manufacturer. Thus, the results of research on the toxicity of GLY to bees are often conflicting, which makes a meta-analysis interesting for data integration, generating a statistically reliable result. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the GLY effects on mortality of bees through a meta-analysis. For this, a search was carried out in the databases Web of Science, CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - Brazil), Scopus, and PubMed. Papers that evaluated the effect of GLY on bee mortality published between 1945 and October 2020, were considered. After obtaining the data, R software was used to perform the meta-analytical tests. Sixteen papers on mortality were selected with 34 data sets. Most of the sets demonstrated differences between the control and experimental groups, showing that the treatments with GLY caused higher mortality of bees. The results considering the methodology used (ingestion or contact), the phase of the biological cycle (adults or larvae), and the dose (ecologically relevant dose and recommended by the manufacturer) were different when compared with their respective control groups. Therefore, GLY can be considered toxic to bees. It is important to emphasize that this meta-analysis identified that papers assessing the toxicity of GLY to bees are still scarce, for both lethal and sublethal effects, mainly for stingless and solitary bee species.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Folate is an essential nutrient required for many different functions in the body. It is particularly important for DNA synthesis, immune functions, and during pregnancy. Folate supplements are commonly prescribed by health professionals for a number of different conditions, however, the absorption of the different derivatives remains unclear. The aim of this review was to assess the bioavailability of various forms of folate supplements in healthy populations and animal models. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted of original research, which assessed the bioavailability of different oral forms of folate in healthy adults or animal models. The following databases were searched: PubMed (U.S. National Library of Medicine), ProQuest Medical Collection (ProQuest) and ScienceDirect (Elsevier) up to March 30, 2017. The inclusion criteria consisted of both animal and human research, no disease state or condition, and assessed levels after an intervention of a folate derivative. RESULTS: A total of 23 studies out of 5226 met the full inclusion criteria. Of these, 4 were animal studies and 19 were human studies. There was variation in supplement forms used with the most commonly tested being folic acid followed by 5-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF). Dosages ranged from 25 μg up to 200 mg. Only three studies found a statistically significant difference in folate bioavailability when evaluating different supplement forms. These studies found 5-MTHF to be more effective at increasing folate levels in participants. CONCLUSIONS: This review has found a number of methodological limitations and conflicting results. Only three out of the 23 studies assessed found a statistically significant difference between different supplemental forms of folate. Quality absorption studies assessing the bioavailability of oral folate supplements are crucial if clinicians are to make effective evidence-based recommendations. More research is required for greater clarification regarding the bioavailability of these supplements.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Climate change affects livestock production and productivity, which could threaten livestock-based food security in pastoral and agro-pastoral production systems of the tropics and sub-tropics. Boran cattle breed is one of the hardiest Zebu cattle reared by Borana Oromo pastoralists for milk and meat production. However, there is limited comprensive information on production, reproduction and adaption traits of the Boran cattle in Ethiopia. Thus, this paper aims to compile the main production, reproduction and some adaptation traits of Boran cattle based on systematic review and meta-analysis of peer reviewed published and unpublished literature. METHODOLOGY: A combination of systematic review and meta-analysis based on PRISMA guideline was employed. Accordingly, out of 646 recorded articles identified through database searching, 64 were found to be eligible for production, reproduction and adaptation characteristics of the Boran cattle, 28 articles were included in qualitative systematic review while 36 articles were used for quantitative meta-analysis. RESULT: The Boran cattle breed has the ability to survive, produce and reproduce under high ambient temperature, utilize low quality forage resources, and resist water shortage or long watering intervals and tick infestations. The review revealed that the breed employs various adaptation responses (morphological, physiological, biochemical, metabolic, cellular and molecular responses) to cope with harsh environmental conditions including climate change, rangeland degradation, seasonal feed and water shortages and high incidences of tick infestations. The meta-analysis using a random-effects model allowed provision of pooled estimates of heritability and genetic correlations for reproduction and production traits, which could be used to solve genetic prediction equations under a population level in purebred Boran cattle. In addition, heritability and genetic-correlation estimates found in the present study suggest that there is high genetic variability for most traits in Boran cattle, and that genetic progress is possible for all studied traits in this breed. CONCLUSION: The Boran cattle breed has the ability to survive, produce and reproduce under high ambient temperature, utilize low quality forage resources, and resist water shortage or long watering intervals and tick infestations. However, currently there are several challenges such as recurrent droughts, pasture deterioration and lack of systematic selection and breeding programs that play to undermine the realization of the potential of the breed. Thus, we recommend systematic selection for enhancing the reproductive and production performances without compromising the adaptation traits of the breed coupled with improved management of rangelands.},

The aim of this review was to assess the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of these drugs in dogs and cats. Through a systematic review of the literature, we identified 37 articles on the use of misoprostol, sucralfate and other gastroprotectants in dogs and cats. There was evidence to support use of misoprostol in the prevention of aspirin-induced gastroduodenal mucosal injury in dogs, and for use of sucralfate in the prevention of acid-induced oesophagitis in cats. However, the overall quality of evidence supporting the use of these drugs in small animal patients was poor. In contrast, there was evidence of important adverse effects, especially drug interaction and gastro-intestinal signs. We therefore recommend prescribing these drugs with caution until further well-conducted studies reveal a useful gastroprotectant effect.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Amplifying endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms is a promising avenue for stroke therapy. One target is mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine kinase regulating cell proliferation, cell survival, protein synthesis, and autophagy. Animal studies investigating the effect of rapamycin on mTOR inhibition following cerebral ischemia have shown conflicting results. AIM: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of rapamycin in reducing infarct volume in animal models of ischemic stroke. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: Our search identified 328 publications. Seventeen publications met inclusion criteria (52 comparisons: 30 reported infarct size and 22 reported neurobehavioral score). Study quality was modest (median 4 of 9) with no evidence of publication bias. The point estimate for the effect of rapamycin was a 21.6\% (95\% CI, 7.6\%-35.7\% p {\textless} 0.01) improvement in infarct volume and 30.5\% (95\% CI 17.2\%-43.8\%, p {\textless} 0.0001) improvement in neuroscores. Effect sizes were greatest in studies using lower doses of rapamycin. CONCLUSION: Low-dose rapamycin treatment may be an effective therapeutic option for stroke. Modest study quality means there is a potential risk of bias. We recommend further high-quality preclinical studies on rapamycin in stroke before progressing to clinical trials.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Zoonotic diseases account for a substantial portion of infectious disease outbreaks and burden on public health programs to maintain surveillance and preventative measures. Taking advantage of new modeling approaches and data sources have become necessary in an interconnected global community. To facilitate data collection, analysis, and decision-making, the number of spatial decision support systems reported in the last 10 years has increased. This systematic review aims to describe characteristics of spatial decision support systems developed to assist public health officials in the management of zoonotic disease outbreaks. METHODS: A systematic search of the Google Scholar database was undertaken for published articles written between 2008 and 2018, with no language restriction. A manual search of titles and abstracts using Boolean logic and keyword search terms was undertaken using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extraction included items such as spatial database management, visualizations, and report generation. RESULTS: For this review we screened 34 full text articles. Design and reporting quality were assessed, resulting in a final set of 12 articles which were evaluated on proposed interventions and identifying characteristics were described. Multisource data integration, and user centered design were inconsistently applied, though indicated diverse utilization of modeling techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristics, data sources, development and modeling techniques implemented in the design of recent SDSS that target zoonotic disease outbreak were described. There are still many challenges to address during the design process to effectively utilize the value of emerging data sources and modeling methods. In the future, development should adhere to comparable standards for functionality and system development such as user input for system requirements, and flexible interfaces to visualize data that exist on different scales.

The resulting manuscripts underwent a 4-step appraisal process, and further manuscripts were sourced from reference lists. This process resulted in a final sample of 70 articles that addressed cow and calf health. Sufficient literature was available to assess mastitis in cows, and scours, cryptosporidiosis, Johne's disease, pneumonia, immunity, and mortality in calves. The results for cryptosporidiosis, pneumonia, immunity, and mortality were mixed, with some differences between studies likely attributable to flawed comparisons between cohorts. Overall, the articles addressing calf scours and mastitis pointed to beneficial or no effects of suckling. The studies addressing Johne's disease did not find cow-calf contact to be a significant risk factor. In conclusion, the scientific peer-reviewed literature on cow and calf health provides no consistent evidence in support of early separation.},

	abstract = {The present study aimed to investigate the relationships between each step of the reproductive process (cyclicity, estrus, and fertility) and both milk production and body reserves management. The database included 102 studies and 300 treatments collected on electronic databases. Coding for each type of experimental factor enabled within and between experiment variation to be distinguished, and to select subsets of experiments with common objectives in order to avoid inappropriate aggregation of results across studies with very different objectives. Finally, the models were based on limited numbers of experiments (from 14 to 30 treatments originating from 7 to 15 distinct experiments) because (i) only data coded for diet and genetic factors were analyzed, separately (studies on other factors such as milking frequency and parity were too scarce); (ii) a minimum of variation of the explanatory variable was set to enable the quantification of the relationship; (iii) few studies reported comparable reproductive, production and body reserves traits. The results of the meta-analyses showed that the commencement of luteal activity (C-LA) was not associated with milk yield and that the relationship between C-LA and body condition score (BCS) at calving was quadratic (with an optimal BCS at calving around 3.10 on a 0-5 scale). Although the interval from calving to first observed estrus (COE1) is partly composed of C-LA, it was not associated with BCS. For each additional 1 kg of milk yield produced at both peak and over the initial 14 weeks of lactation, COE1 was delayed by 1.1 days. The conception rate to first insemination (CRAI1) was reduced by 2.0\% (of inseminated cows) and by 2.2\% for each additional 1 kg of milk yield at peak and at service respectively. Moreover, CRAI1 was increased by 38.2\% and 22.0\% for each additional 1 score of BCS at service and at nadir (i.e. lowest BCS) respectively. Finally, risk of pregnancy (PR) was not associated with milk yield. However, PR was increased by 42.8\% (of cows) and 16.8\% for each additional unit of BCS at calving and at nadir, respectively. This meta-analysis showed that postpartum cyclicity of dairy cows was mainly associated with BCS at calving, whereas estrus expression was mainly associated with milk yield and fertility with both BCS and milk yield. Genetic and nutritional strategies that target a BCS of 3.10 and limit both BCS loss and peak milk yield could be an effective way to improve reproduction.},

	abstract = {Monkeypox is a vesicular-pustular illness that carries a secondary attack rate in the order of 10\% in contacts unvaccinated against smallpox. Case fatality rates range from 1 to 11\%, but scarring and other sequelae are common in survivors. It continues to cause outbreaks in remote populations in Central and West Africa, in areas with poor access and weakened or disrupted surveillance capacity and information networks. Recent outbreaks in Nigeria (2017-18) and Cameroon (2018) have occurred where monkeypox has not been reported for over 20 years. This has prompted concerns over whether there have been changes in the biology and epidemiology of the disease that may in turn have implications for how outbreaks and cases should best be managed. A systematic review was carried out to examine reported data on human monkeypox outbreaks over time, and to identify if and how epidemiology has changed. Published and grey literature were critically analysed, and data extracted to inform recommendations on outbreak response, use of case definitions and public health advice. The level of detail, validity of data, geographical coverage and consistency of reporting varied considerably across the 71 monkeypox outbreak documents obtained. An increase in cases reported over time was supported by literature from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Data were insufficient to measure trends in secondary attack rates and case fatality rates. Phylogenetic analyses consistently identify two strains of the virus without evidence of emergence of a new strain. Understanding of monkeypox virulence with regard to clinical presentation by strain is minimal, with infrequent sample collection and laboratory analysis. A variety of clinical and surveillance case definitions are described in the literature: two definitions have been formally evaluated and showed high sensitivity but low specificity. These were specific to a Congo-Basin (CB) strain-affected area of the DRC where they were used. Evidence on use of antibiotics for prophylaxis against secondary cutaneous infection is anecdotal and limited. Current evidence suggests there has been an increase in total monkeypox cases reported by year in the DRC irrespective of advancements in the national Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) system. There has been a marked increase in number of individual monkeypox outbreak reports, from outside the DRC in between 2010 and 2018, particularly in the Central African Republic (CAR) although this does not necessarily indicate an increase in annual cases over time in these areas. The geographical pattern reported in the Nigeria outbreak suggests a possible new and widespread zoonotic reservoir requiring further investigation and research. With regards to outbreak response, increased attention is warranted for high-risk patient groups, and nosocomial transmission risks. The animal reservoir remains unknown and there is a dearth of literature informing case management and successful outbreak response strategies. Up-to-date complete, consistent and longer-term research is sorely needed to inform and guide evidence-based response and management of monkeypox outbreaks.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The optimal surgical technique for treatment of cranial cruciate ligament rupture in canine has been scientifically discussed for decades. Despite the continuous debate, proximal tibial osteotomies such as tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) and tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA) are increasingly common. The objective of this review was to systematically evaluate the literature reporting outcome and complications associated with TPLO and TTA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search of literature databases identified articles published from August 2004 to February 2016 describing evaluations of short- or longterm outcomes as well as complications following TPLO or TTA. RESULTS: Ninety-one studies were included in this review and assigned to one out of four evidence levels. Of those, 89 studies provided the lowest evidence level and only two were assigned to the third-best evidence level. A comparison of subjective gait analyses could not detect differences in the decrease of lameness between TPLO and TTA, while objective gait analysis supports the superiority of TPLO. Fewer patients treated with TPLO were diagnosed with postoperative joint instability and TPLO had a lower percent increase of osteoarthritis (OA) after surgery. Owner satisfaction was high for both techniques. For TPLO and TTA the average total, minor, major and catastrophic complication rates were 15.9 \% and 20.8 \%, 7.9 \% and 11.6 \%, 5.2 \% and 13.2 \% as well as 0.8 \% and 5.6 \%, respectively. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The assessed literature supports the hypothesis that TPLO is associated with lower complication rates, an improved clinical-functional outcome and less increase of OA compared to TTA. The results are indicative for a long-term restoration of normal limb function after TPLO. However, the strength of available evidence and the comparability of each study's results were poor and more comparative studies are needed to draw strong conclusions towards the superiority of the TPLO over the TTA.},

	abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Maca - Lepidium meyenii Walp. has been cultivated and used by Andean people for over 1300-2000 years in Peru as food and medicine. Starting in the late 1990's it has developed into an important herbal medicine in China and is now cultivated there widely, too Aim of study: This study aims to provide an insight into the emergence of maca on the global market as an alternative remedy to treat reproductive health related problems in both men and women and to critically assess these health claims. Methodology: A search of electronic databases such as EMBASE and a hand-search was done to acquire peer-reviewed articles and reports about maca. Results and discussion: Lepidium meyenii is used traditionally as a tonic, fertility enhancer for both humans and cattle, and to treat a variety of ailments such as rheumatism, respiratory disorders and anaemia among others. Maca root is cooked, baked, fermented as a drink and made into porridge. In the last twenty years, maca was introduced onto the global market and demand has dramatically grown over this time with its promotion on the internet, as the 'Peruvian Ginseng' for libido and fertility enhancement. It has also been said to treat menopausal symptoms, erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The sky-rocketing demand for the plant has seen a shift from traditional cultivation methods to mass production practices with the use of fertilisers and also pesticides; as maca is now grown in areas other than the Andes such as in the Yunnan province in China. This can potentially affect the phytochemistry and composition of the plant and thus, the quality, safety and efficacy of maca products. Meanwhile, research into maca's medicinal properties has followed the spike in popularity of maca and has been focused mainly on maca's aphrodisiac and fertility enhancing properties. So far, the in vivo studies and clinical trials conducted have yielded inconclusive results. Some of the key limitations reside in methodology and sample size. Chemical profiling, led to the discovery of new compounds unique to maca, such as, 'macamides' and also other active metabolites like the glucosinolates; to which the medicinal effects of maca have been ascribed but cannot be confirmed due to lack of data. Conclusions: To date, the health claims of maca cannot be fully supported from a scientific standpoint and more research is needed. It appears that the indigenous local knowledge about the health benefits of maca has been dragged out of context to fit the demands of a growing market for herbal remedies. This globalisation (or hype esp. in China) also has had serious consequences for the local producers in Peru. The lack of protocols to regulate the production and marketing of maca during this rapid expansion, poses a threat to both the safety of consumers and the sustainability of supply.},

A total of 23 in vivo studies were identified in which Agolin was supplemented at 1 g/d per cow; then a meta-analysis was performed to determine the response ratio on milk yield, rumen fermentation, methane emissions and health. Results indicated that an adaptation period of at least 4 weeks of treatment is required. Whereas short-term studies showed minor and inconsistent effects of Agolin, long-term studies ({\textgreater}4 weeks of treatment) revealed that Agolin supplementation increases milk yield (+3.6\%), fat and protein corrected milk (+4.1\%) and feed efficiency (+4.4\%) without further changes in milk composition and feed intake. Long-term treatment also decreased methane production per day (-8.8\%), per dry matter intake (-12.9\%) and per fat and protein corrected milk yield (-9.9\%) without changes in rumen fermentation pattern. In conclusion, despite the mode of action is still unclear and the small number of studies considered, these findings show that Agolin represents an encouraging alternative to improve productivity in dairy cows.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic disease causing severe symptoms in pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals. On average, worldwide, around 30\% of people are seropositive. The oral transmission route is of great significance and food, particularly meat, is an important transmission vehicle for T. gondii. However, the role of different food matrices is debated. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to assess the risk of humans developing acute T. gondii infection via the foodborne route. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Case-control studies including acute cases of T. gondii infection were included after literature searches, without time limits, in several databases. All studies estimating the risk of acquiring T. gondii infection after consumption of specific food categories were included. RESULTS: Three risk factors proved to be significantly associated with acute T. gondii infection in humans: consumption of raw/undercooked meat, Odds Ratio (OR) 3.44 (1.29-9.16), consumption of raw/undercooked beef, OR 2.22 (1.57-3.12), and consumption of raw/undercooked sheep meat, OR 3.85 (1.85-8.00). Consumption of raw/undercooked pork, raw eggs, and unpasteurized milk proved to be non-significant risk factors. LIMITATIONS: Limitations in the present review and meta-analysis are due to the low number of case-control studies available for analysis and the lack of a search strategy targeting gray literature. CONCLUSION: Consumption of raw/undercooked beef and sheep meat are important risk factors for T. gondii infection. Their consumption should be avoided in order to prevent toxoplasmosis, particularly by those in at-risk categories, including pregnant women.

We estimated the global case fatality rate (CFR) of CCHFV infections and the prevalence of CCHFV in humans, ticks and other animal species. We also explored the socio-demographic and clinical factors that influence these parameters. In this systematic review with meta-analyses we searched publications from database inception to 03rd February 2020 in Pubmed, Scopus, and Global Index Medicus. Studies included in this review provided cross-sectional data on the CFR and/or prevalence of one or more targets used for the detection of CCHFV. Two independent investigators selected studies to be included. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently by all authors. Data collected were analysed using a random effect meta-analysis. In all, 2345 records were found and a total of 312 articles (802 prevalence and/or CFR data) that met the inclusion criteria were retained. The overall CFR was 11.7\% (95\% CI = 9.1-14.5), 8.0\% (95\% CI = 1.0-18.9), and 4.7\% (95\% CI = 0.0-37.6) in humans with acute, recent, and past CCHFV infections respectively. The overall CCHFV acute infections prevalence was 22.5\% (95\% CI = 15.7-30.1) in humans, 2.1\% (95\% CI = 1.3-2.9) in ticks, and 4.5\% (95\% CI = 1.9-7.9) in other animal species. The overall CCHFV recent infections seroprevalence was 11.6\% (95\% CI = 7.9-16.4) in humans and 0.4\% (95\% CI = 0.0-2.9) in other animal species. The overall CCHFV past infections seroprevalence was 4.3\% (95\% CI = 3.3-5.4) in humans and 12.0\% (95\% CI = 9.9-14.3) in other animal species. CFR was higher in low-income countries, countries in the WHO African, South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions, in adult and ambulatory patients. CCHFV detection rate in humans were higher in CCHFV suspected cases, healthcare workers, adult and hospitalized patients, ticks of the genus Ornithodoros and Amblyomma and in animals of the orders Perissodactyla and Bucerotiformes. This review highlights a significant disease burden due to CCHFV with a strong disparity according to country income levels, geographic regions, various human categories and tick and other animal species. Preventive measures in the light of these findings are expected.},

	abstract = {Ovariohysterectomy in female dogs is a frequent surgical procedure for sterilization. However, there might be short-term and long-term complications that are necessary to know. This systematic review aims to identify complications due to ovariohysterectomy in dogs, analyzing the methodological quality of the studies that provide data. 40 studies published in Spanish, English, and Portuguese were identified through an electronic search in Pub Med, Medwell Journals, Scielo, Science Direct, and Google Academic. Six descriptive studies of complications due to canine ovariohysterectomy were selected. Studies on complications with non-comparable methodologies were excluded. Heterogeneity was observed in the characteristics and quality of the studies. The majority used convenience sampling, in which the number of participants varied between 72 and 1880. The analysis units were purebred and crossbred canine females from 6 to 108 months of age. The follow-up period of patients for the assessment of complications varied from one week to ten years. The proportion of complications ranged from 0.1 to 74\%. The main events reported are those that occur in short term periods, such as anesthetic complications, bleeding, and wound inflammation. In the long term, there is urinary incontinence, pyometra, and obesity. It is concluded that the scientific evidence available on complications in dogs sterilized by ovariohysterectomy is not enough to support decision-making in the clinical practice with respect to the topic addressed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given the limitations of current therapies for the reconstruction of bone defects, regenerative medicine has arisen as a new therapeutic strategy along with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which, because of their osteogenic potential and immunomodulatory properties, have emerged as a promising alternative for the treatment of bone injuries. In vivo studies have demonstrated that MSCs have a positive effect on regeneration due to their secretion of cytokines and growth factors that, when collected in conditioned medium (MSC-CM) and applied to an injured tissue, can modulate and promote the formation of new tissue. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of application of conditioned medium derived from mesenchymal stem cells in bone regeneration in animal and human models. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review with a comprehensive search through February of 2018 using several electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CENTRAL (Ovid), and LILACS), and we also used the "snowballing technique". Articles that met the inclusion criteria were selected through abstract review and subsequent assessment of the full text. We assessed the risk of bias with the SYRCLE and Cochrane tools, and three meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: We included 21 articles, 19 of which used animal models and 2 of which used human models. In animal models, the application of MSC-CM significantly increased the regeneration of bone defects in comparison with control groups. Human studies reported early mineralization in regenerated bones, and no bone resorption, inflammation, nor local or systemic alterations were observed in any case. The meta-analysis showed an overall favorable effect of the application of MSC-CM. CONCLUSIONS: The application of MSC-CM to bone defects has a positive and favorable effect on the repair and regeneration of bone tissue, particularly in animal models. It is necessary to perform additional studies to support the application of MSC-CM in clinical practice.},

The prevention of tick-borne diseases is strictly linked to the successful management of tick vector populations. The employ of repellents can represent a worth solution to avoid tick bites. It is widely adopted to protect travellers and pets exposed to ticks during limited periods of the year. The use of natural products as active ingredients in eco-friendly repellent formulations is currently a prominent research area, due to the wide diversity and high effectiveness of a number of plant-borne compounds, with special reference to essential oils (EOs) extracted from medicinal and aromatic species. Here, we reviewed current knowledge available on EOs tested as repellents against tick species of veterinary importance. Furthermore, we analysed the effectiveness of pure compounds isolated from EOs as tick repellents and their potential implications for practical use in the öreal world". A quantitative analysis of literature available is this research field was provided, along with its impact (i.e., in terms of citations over time) on the scientific community of researchers in tick control science and natural product chemistry. In the final sections, future outlooks are highlighted. We discussed major challenges to stabilize the most effective EOs and pure molecules, explore the synergistic and antagonistic effects in blends of EOs and/or pure constituents, standardize currently adopted testing methods, and evaluate non-target risks of herbal repellents.},

	abstract = {Fungal infections are one of the most prevalent diseases in the world and there is a lack of new antifungal drug development for these diseases. We conducted a systematic review of the literature regarding the in vitro antifungal activity of the organoselenium compounds ebselen (Eb) and diphenyl diselenide [(PhSe)2]. A systematic review was carried out based on the search for articles with data concerning Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values, indexed in international databases and published until August 2020. A total of 2337 articles were found, and, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria used, 22 articles were included in the study. Inhibitory activity against 96\% (200/208) and 95\% (312/328) of the pathogenic fungi tested was described for Eb and [(PhSe)2], respectively. Including in these 536 fungal isolates tested, organoselenium activity was highlighted against Candida spp., Cryptococcus ssp., Trichosporon spp., Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., Pythium spp., and Sporothrix spp., with MIC values lower than 64 μg/mL. In conclusion, Eb and [(PhSe)2] have a broad spectrum of in vitro inhibitory antifungal activity. These data added with other pharmacological properties of these organoselenium compounds suggest that both compounds are potential future antifungal drugs. Whether MICs toward the upper end of the ranges described here are compatible with efficacious therapy, and whether they may achieve such end as a result of the favorable non-antimicrobial effects of selenium on the host, requires more in vivo testing.
Fungal infections require the investigation of new drugs. The study is a systematic review of organo-selenium compounds with potential antifungal action. In 22 articles included in this review, in a total of 536 isolates of pathogenic fungi tested, the compounds showed action in more than 90\% of them.

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0201077},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-union affects up to 10\% of fractures and is associated with substantial morbidity. There is currently no single effective therapy for the treatment or prevention of non-union. Potential treatments are currently selected for clinical trials based on results from limited animal studies, with no attempt to compare results between therapies to determine which have the greatest potential to treat non-union. AIM: The aim of this systematic review was to define the range of therapies under investigation at the preclinical stage for the prevention or treatment of fracture non-union. Additionally, through meta-analysis, it aimed to identify the most promising therapies for progression to clinical investigation. METHODS: MEDLINE and Embase were searched from 1St January 2004 to 10th April 2017 for controlled trials evaluating an intervention to prevent or treat fracture non-union. Data regarding the model used, study intervention and outcome measures were extracted, and risk of bias assessed. RESULTS: Of 5,171 records identified, 197 papers describing 204 therapies were included. Of these, the majority were only evaluated once (179/204, 88\%), with chitosan tested most commonly (6/204, 3\%). Substantial variation existed in model design, length of survival and duration of treatment, with results poorly reported. These factors, as well as a lack of consistently used objective outcome measures, precluded meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the variability and poor methodological reporting of current non-union research. The authors call for a consensus on the standardisation of animal models investigating non-union, and suggest journals apply stringent criteria when considering animal work for publication.},

	abstract = {Meat eaters often have an ambivalent relationship with the common practice of killing animals for food. They enjoy the taste of meat but dislike the harming of animals that it entails. This moral conflict, often referred to as the 'meat paradox,' tends to result in cognitive dissonance that meat eaters need to resolve. One of the arguably most basic strategies to deal with this dissonance is to cognitively dissociate meat from its animal origins. Whereas philosophers for long time have theorized about the role of such dissociation for consumer behavior, researchers have only recently started to empirically investigate the phenomenon. Here, we present the first systematic literature review of research on consumers' tendency to dissociate meat from its animal origins. Twenty-one publications comprising eight qualitative, one mixed-methods, four correlational, and twenty experimental/interventional studies were identified, which all provided support for the central psychological role of dissociation for meat consumption. However, the review also revealed the need for further research on moderating variables such as gender, age and generation, dietary styles, and people's place of living, including cross-cultural differences. Strikingly, no study so far seems to have included behavioral outcomes, urging the need for future research on how dissociation might affect behavior.},

	abstract = {Some studies have reported that milk and dairy product consumption reduces bladder cancer incidence, whereas others have reported null or opposite findings. This meta-analysis of 26 cohort and case-control studies has been conducted to pool the risk of the association between milk and dairy products and bladder cancer. A systematic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Web of Science (from inception to 30 April 2018) was conducted. Random-effects models were used to compute pooled estimates of RR for high or medium compared with low consumption of milk and dairy. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. Subgroup analyses were performed based on type of dairy, gender, geographic location, and type of study design. Random-effects meta-regression was used to evaluate other confounding factors. Overall, medium compared with low consumption was associated with lower pooled risk of bladder cancer for total dairy products (RR = 0.90; 95\% CI: 0.81, 0.98), milk (RR = 0.90; 95\% CI: 0.82, 0.98), and fermented dairy products (RR = 0.87; 95\% CI: 0.79, 0.96). The inverse association for milk consumption was stronger in Asians (RR = 0.79; 95\% CI: 0.59, 0.98) and in cohort design studies (RR = 0.85; 95\% CI: 0.71, 0.99). Moreover, high compared with low consumption was significantly associated with a lower pooled risk for milk (RR = 0.89; 95\% CI: 0.81, 0.98) and fermented dairy products (RR = 0.78; 95\% CI: 0.61, 0.94). However, high compared with low consumption of whole milk was significantly associated with a higher risk (RR = 1.21; 95\% CI: 1.04, 1.38). The statistical heterogeneity was considerable. In conclusion, the present meta-analysis suggests a decreased risk of bladder cancer associated with medium consumption of total dairy products and with medium and high consumption of milk and fermented dairy products. An increased risk of bladder cancer was observed with high consumption of whole milk. Interpretations of the results should be made with caution.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: West African landscapes are largely characterised by complex agroforest mosaics. Although the West African forests are considered a nonhuman primate hotspot, knowledge on the distribution of many species is often lacking and out-of-date. Considering the fast-changing nature of the landscapes in this region, up-to-date information on primate occurrence is urgently needed, particularly of taxa such as colobines, which may be more sensitive to habitat modification than others. Understanding wildlife occurrence and mechanisms of persistence in these human-dominated landscapes is fundamental for developing effective conservation strategies. METHODS: In this paper, we aim to review current knowledge on the distribution of three threatened primates in Guinea-Bissau and neighbouring regions, highlighting research gaps and identifying priority research and conservation action. We conducted a systematic literature review of primate studies from 1976 to 2016 in Guinea-Bissau, southern Senegal and western Guinea (Boké Region). We mapped historical observation records of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus), Temminck's red colobus (Pilicolobus badius temminckii) and king colobus (Colobus polykomos), including our preliminary survey data from Dulombi, a newly established National Park (NP) in Guinea-Bissau. RESULTS: We found 151 documents, including 87 journal articles, that contained field data on primates in this region. In Guinea-Bissau, nearly all studies focussed south of the Corubal River, including mainly Cantanhez, Cufada, and Boé NP's. In Senegal, most of the data came from Fongoli and Niokolo-Koba NP. In Boké (Guinea) studies are few, with the most recent data coming from Sangarédi. In Dulombi NP we recorded eight primate species, including chimpanzees, red colobus and king colobus. Across the selected region, chimpanzees, red colobus and king colobus were reported in eleven, twelve and seven protected areas, respectively. DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrates large geographical research gaps particularly for the two colobines. For the first time after more than two decades, we confirm the presence of red colobus and king colobus north of the Corubal River in Guinea-Bissau. The little information available from large parts of the red colobus range raises questions regarding levels of population fragmentation in this species, particularly in Casamance and across northern Guinea-Bissau. There are still no records demonstrating the occurrence of king colobus in Senegal, and the presence of a viable population in north-eastern Guinea-Bissau remains uncertain. While the occurrence of chimpanzees in Guinea-Bissau and Senegal is well documented, data from Boké (Guinea) are sparse and out-of-date. Our approach-the mapping of data gathered from a systematic literature review-allows us to provide recommendations for selecting future geographical survey locations and planning further research and conservation strategies in this region.},

To provide an overview of how GnRH or hCG treatment between 4 and 15 d after artificial insemination (AI) improves pregnancy per AI (P/AI) in cows, a meta-analysis was performed on 107 different trials from 52 publications. Data from 18,082 treated cows and 18,385 untreated controls were meta-analyzed. The meta-analysis explained the relative risk for P/AI with GnRH or hCG treatment under various circumstances. The results did not show any difference in P/AI between cows treated with hCG and cows treated with GnRH. Compared with no treatment, treatment with GnRH or hCG improved the chances of P/AI in cows with very poor ({\textless}30\%) and poor (30.1 to 45\%) fertility, whereas treatment did not benefit cows with very good fertility ({\textgreater}60.1\%). Moreover, treatment with GnRH and hCG improved the chances of P/AI in primiparous cows. The improvement was much better in primiparous cows with very low fertility. Treatment with buserelin at a dose above 10 µg and with hCG at a dose above 2,500 IU was associated with increased chances of P/AI compared with lower doses. Treatment with GnRH 10 d after AI was also associated with increased chances of P/AI compared with earlier treatment. The present meta-analysis showed that the use of GnRH and hCG after AI should be focused on cows expected to have low or moderate fertility. Day and dose of treatment have to be considered as well.},

Potential reasons include systematic differences of post-ischemic neuroinflammation between humans and rodents. We here performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize and compare the spatial and temporal distribution of immune cell infiltration in human and rodent stroke. Data on spatiotemporal distribution of immune cells (T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils) and infarct volume were extracted. Data from all rodent studies were pooled by means of a random-effect meta-analysis. Overall, 20 human and 188 rodent stroke studies were included in our analyses. In both patients and rodents, the infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils preceded the lymphocytic influx. Macrophages and neutrophils were the predominant immune cells within 72 h after infarction. Although highly heterogeneously across studies, the temporal profile of the poststroke immune response was comparable between patients and rodents. In rodent stroke, the extent of the immune cell infiltration depended on the duration and location of vessel occlusion and on the species. The density of infiltrating immune cells correlated with the infarct volume. In summary, we provide the first systematic analysis and comparison of human and rodent post-ischemic neuroinflammation. Our data suggest that the inflammatory response in rodent stroke models is comparable to that in patients with stroke. However, the overall heterogeneity of the post-ischemic immune response might contribute to the translational failure in stroke research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: p53 is a tumor suppressor protein involved in regulating a wide array of signaling pathways. The role of p53 in the cell is determined by the type of imposed oxidative stress, its intensity and duration. The last decade of research has unravelled a dual nature in the function of p53 in mediating the oxidative stress burden. However, this is dependent on the specific properties of the applied stress and thus requires further analysis. METHODS: A systematic review was performed following an electronic search of Pubmed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect databases. Articles published in the English language between January 1, 1990 and March 1, 2017 were identified and isolated based on the analysis of p53 in skeletal muscle in both animal and cell culture models. RESULTS: Literature was categorized according to the modality of imposed oxidative stress including exercise, diet modification, exogenous oxidizing agents, tissue manipulation, irradiation, and hypoxia. With low to moderate levels of oxidative stress, p53 is involved in activating pathways that increase time for cell repair, such as cell cycle arrest and autophagy, to enhance cell survival. However, with greater levels of stress intensity and duration, such as with irradiation, hypoxia, and oxidizing agents, the role of p53 switches to facilitate increased cellular stress levels by initiating DNA fragmentation to induce apoptosis, thereby preventing aberrant cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: Current evidence confirms that p53 acts as a threshold regulator of cellular homeostasis. Therefore, within each modality, the intensity and duration are parameters of the oxidative stressor that must be analyzed to determine the role p53 plays in regulating signaling pathways to maintain cellular health and function in skeletal muscle.

	abstract = {Batoids (Chondrichthyes: Batoidea; e.g. stingrays, skates, and guitarfish) comprise more than 55\% of elasmobranch taxa and represent ecologically important predators in benthic and pelagic habitats. Although overexploitation and habitat degradation are the two biggest threats to batoid populations, coastal and oceanic pollution is also a pervasive potential threat. In this systematic review, we compile published scientific literature on trace metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) contamination in elasmobranch species of the Batoidea superorder and present contamination patterns, exposure effects, and potential human exposure risks to most reported contaminants. We found batoids to accumulate a wide range of trace metals, including mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn). Accumulation of POPs is reported for chlordanes, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), dieldrin, Heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Hg levels in muscle tissue were significantly different among oceanic basins and habitats, consistent with previous global assessments of Hg oceanic background levels. Some batoid species presented Hg levels higher than large pelagic teleost fishes and comparable to sharks. Ecological traits such as, bottom feeding, upper trophic position and elasmobranch-specific physiology and metabolism are discussed as potential factors associated with Hg uptake and accumulation in batoids. Some species exceeded USEPA's maximum contamination safety limits in edible tissues for Hg, As and ΣPCBs. For most trace metals and POPs, there is a lack of studies focusing on contamination levels in batoids. We recommend future research increasing reporting on POPs and trace metals besides Hg in batoids to further investigate the role of Elasmobranch as a bioindicator for marine pollution.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Azoles are considered as one of the most efficient fungicides for the treatment of humans, animals, and plant fungal pathogens. They are of significant clinical importance as antifungal drugs and are widely used in personal care products, ultraviolet stabilizers, and in aircraft for its anti-corrosive properties. The prevalence of azole compounds in the natural environment and its accumulation in fish raises questions about its impact on aquatic organisms. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this paper is to review the scientific studies on the effects of azole compounds in fish and to discuss future opportunities for the risk evaluation. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted on Web of Science, PubMed, and ScienceDirect to locate peer-reviewed scientific articles on occurrence, environmental fate, and toxicological impact of azole fungicides on fish. RESULTS: Studies included in this review provide ample evidence that azole compounds are not only commonly detected in the natural environment but also cause several detrimental effects on fish. Future studies with environmentally relevant concentrations of azole alone or in combination with other commonly occurring contaminants in a multigenerational study could provide a better understanding. CONCLUSION: Based on current knowledge and studies reporting adverse biological effects of azole on fish, considerable attention is required for better management and effective ecological risk assessment of these emerging contaminants.},

Electronic search was conducted in Pubmed, PEDro and Scopus databases from inception till June 2018. Randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental trials which investigated the effects of RT (for at least 4 weeks) on cardiac autonomic control (assessed either by heart rate variability, baroreflex sensitivity or post-exercise heart rate recovery) in animal models were included. Out of the total 3,442 studies retrieved by the electronic search, 9 were found to be suitable as per the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. The majority of these studies (6 out of 9) demonstrated improvement in cardiovascular autonomic control after RT in animals; however, three studies did not illustrate any significant change. Standardised mean differences (SMD) showed a significant effect of RT on root mean square of successive differences between adjacent inter-beat (R-R) intervals (RMSSD) [SMD (confidence interval (CI))=4.56 (2.89, 6.23); P{\textless}0.0001] and bradycardic response to change in arterial blood pressure [SMD (CI)=-2.27 (-4.50, -0.03; P=0.05)] whereas no significant change was observed for other variables of cardiac autonomic control post-RT. The present systematic review do not give a clear conclusion regarding the effect of RT on cardiac autonomic control in animal models and thus highlight the need for good quality research in future.},

At the tissue and cellular level, both inflammatory and oxidative processes may be exacerbated post-injury and contribute to further brain damage. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has the potential to downregulate both processes. This review focuses on the potential neuroprotective utility of NAC and N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA) post-TBI. METHODS: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched up to July 2017. Studies that examined clinical and laboratory effects of NAC and NACA post-TBI in human and animal studies were included. Risk of bias was assessed in human and animal studies according to the design of each study (randomized or not). The primary outcome assessed was the effect of NAC/NACA treatment on functional outcome, while secondary outcomes included the impact on biomarkers of inflammation and oxidation. Due to the clinical and methodological heterogeneity observed across studies, no meta-analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Our analyses revealed only three human trials, including two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 20 animal studies conducted using standardized animal models of brain injury. The two RCTs reported improvement in the functional outcome post-NAC/NACA administration. Overall, the evidence from animal studies is more robust and demonstrated substantial improvement of cognition and psychomotor performance following NAC/NACA use. Animal studies also reported significantly more cortical sparing, reduced apoptosis, and lower levels of biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress. No safety concerns were reported in any of the studies included in this analysis. CONCLUSION: Evidence from the animal literature demonstrates a robust association for the prophylactic application of NAC and NACA post-TBI with improved neurofunctional outcomes and downregulation of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers at the tissue level. While a growing body of scientific literature suggests putative beneficial effects of NAC/NACA treatment for TBI, the lack of well-designed and controlled clinical investigations, evaluating therapeutic outcomes, prognostic biomarkers, and safety profiles, limits definitive interpretation and recommendations for its application in humans at this time.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease that leads to more than 120,000 deaths every year. In 2019, World Health Organization (WHO) launched a strategy to decrease its global burden by 2030. There is a range of issues around different interventions for the management of snakebite. Decisions around these interventions should be informed by evidence from systematic reviews (SR). METHODS: An overview of SRs was conducted by searching 12 electronic databases, PROSPERO, contacting experts and screening the bibliography of included reviews. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment (through AMSTAR-2) was done by at least two overview authors independently with discrepancies sorted by consensus. A narrative synthesis was conducted. PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: The overview found 13 completed SRs that has looked at various aspects of management of snakebite envenomation. There was one SR on first aid, nine on effectiveness and safety of snake anti-venom (SAV), two on drugs to prevent adverse reactions due to SAV therapy, and one on surgical interventions for management of snakebite envenomation. All, except one, SR was appraised to have critically low confidence as per AMSTAR-2 Criteria. Evidence base was restricted to few studies for most interventions. DISCUSSION: High quality evidence from SRs is required to inform guidelines and health system decisions which can bring down the burden of snakebite. The review indicates the need to fund high-quality SRs, evidence gaps and core outcome sets which can inform guideline recommendations, funding priorities for conduct of future trials. Variation in species distribution as well as intra-species variation in venom composition implies the need for conduct of region or, nation or state (sub-national) specific randomised controlled trials and SRs on different SAVs and their dosing regimens.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reducing meat consumption can help prevent non-communicable diseases and protect the environment. Interventions targeting conscious determinants of human behaviour are generally acceptable approaches to promote dietary change, but little is known about their effectiveness to reduce the demand for meat. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting conscious determinants of human behaviour to reduce the demand for meat. METHODS: We searched six electronic databases on the 31st of August 2017 with a predefined algorithm, screened publicly accessible resources, contacted authors, and conducted forward and backward reference searches. Eligible studies employed experimental designs to evaluate interventions targeting conscious determinants of human behaviour to reduce the consumption, purchase, or selection of meat in comparison to a control condition, a baseline period, or relative to other eligible interventions. We synthesised results narratively and conducted an exploratory crisp-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to identify combinations of intervention characteristics associated with significant reductions in the demand for meat. RESULTS: We included 24 papers reporting on 59 interventions and 25,477 observations. Self-monitoring interventions and individual lifestyle counselling led to, or were associated with reduced meat consumption. Providing information about the health or environmental consequences of eating meat was associated with reduced intentions to consume and select meat in virtual environments, but there was no evidence to suggest this approach influenced actual behaviour. Education about the animal welfare consequences of eating meat was associated with reduced intentions to consume meat, while interventions implicitly highlighting animal suffering were not. Education on multiple consequences of eating meat led to mixed results. Tailored education was not found to reduce actual or intended meat consumption, though few studies assessed this approach. CONCLUSION: Some interventions targeting conscious determinants of human behaviour have the potential to reduce the demand for meat. In particular, self-monitoring interventions and individual lifestyle counselling can help to reduce meat consumption. There was evidence of effectiveness of some educational messages in reducing intended consumption and selection of meat in virtual environments. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: CRD42017076720 .},

In order to collate the empirical information that is available regarding animal welfare in zoos and aquariums with regard to topics, methods and species, a systematic literature review was conducted of the primary peer-reviewed journals publishing zoo-based and welfare-based research. Journals included Animal Welfare, Animals, Applied Animal Behaviour Science, International Zoo Yearbook, Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science, Journal of Zoo and Aquarium Research, and Zoo Biology. The literature review spanned 2008-2017 and revealed that 7.6\% (n=310) of reviewed publications (n=4,096) in these journals were zoo- or aquarium-based and animal-welfare focused. The main topics studied included enrichment, social conditions and enclosure design, while understudied topics included the welfare of ambassador animals, and the welfare impacts of sound and light. Behaviour was by far the dominant welfare parameter used and the use of hormonal measures declined over this period. Taxonomic representation in these publications was notably skewed. Mammals were the focus of 75\% of studies, and 82\% of studies were vertebrate-focused (great apes being the dominant taxa). This study considers potential reasons for these patterns and highlights research areas for future emphasis that could serve to fill gaps in current knowledge regarding zoo and aquarium animal welfare, including more research into affective states that underlie an animal's welfare status.},

	abstract = {Research on the potential impact of interventions in agriculture on nutrition outcomes is of particular relevance in South Asia where agriculture-related activities are a major source of livelihoods for large sections of society and where the population suffers from one of the highest global burdens of malnutrition in all its forms. This systematic review aims to assess the strength of the available evidence that agricultural interventions have an impact on intermediate and final nutrition outcomes in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Afghanistan. We searched five literature databases and reference lists of previous systematic reviews to identify peer-reviewed studies published between 2012 and 2017, detailing impacts of household- or farm-level agricultural interventions on nutritional outcomes in South Asia. We identified six intervention studies (reported in nine papers) conducted in Bangladesh (two studies), India (two studies) and Nepal (two studies). The majority of studies examined the impact of provision of seed, plants and training to increase home garden fruit and vegetable production with or without integrated poultry provision and training. Other studies evaluated the impact of livestock or aquaculture provision and training. Study designs and quality were mixed; heterogeneity across studies precluded formal meta-analysis. Interventions had a positive impact on intermediate outcomes on the pathway from agricultural intervention to nutritional or health status including dietary quality and dietary diversity of households and individuals (reported in seven papers). The evidence on the impact on final nutritional outcomes was mixed: one paper reported that home gardens with poultry reduced the odds of anaemia but there was no convincing evidence of an impact of agricultural interventions on child anthropometric measurement (reported in four papers). In recent years, the Leveraging Agriculture for Nutrition in South Asia (LANSA) research programme consortium has significantly expanded research on agricultural interventions for nutrition outcomes by conducting and commissioning a suite of formative and feasibility studies that have extended both the range and geographic location of interventions under study. This expanding body of research should, in the future, enable the identification of cost-effective interventions to enhance the impact of agricultural interventions sustainably to improve nutrition outcomes especially in women and children in South Asia.},

The disease has been relevant since the epidemics taken place in Rio de Janeiro in the end of the 20th century, although it was recognized by the government agencies, still considered neglected and underdiagnosed. The meta-analysis study involving 147 works published between 2010 and 2020 revealed that Brazil was highlighted in the occurrence of sporotrichosis, including demonstrating greater global scientific production and figuring a central role in coordinating actions for scientific collaboration with other countries. These joint actions have resulted in social media campaigns, alerting cat guardians of the risks and how the disease presents clinically. Although its good prognosis, the disease has become a public health problem in the diverse regions of Brasil, affecting humans and cats. The observation of the clinical signs and history associated to the diagnostic means are essential to the identification of the Sporotrichosis, by the means of diagnosis, the growth and cytology considered golden standard to identify the agent Sporthrix sp. A quick identification of the sporotrichosis is essential, therefore this review has the porpouse of describing clinical and epidemological patterns of the desease and highlight its significance to society.},

Humans and animals may drink arsenic-contaminated groundwater in addition to consuming foods that have been grown in arsenic-contaminated groundwater and soils. Rice grain is a potential arsenic carrier and the staple food in many parts of the world, particularly in Southeast Asian countries. Data have been summarized from 183 articles describing different aspects of arsenic flow in the food chain, that is, the soil-water-rice-human system and the water-crops-animals system and the bio-availability of arsenic to humans and animals. The phyto-availability of arsenic depends on the physicochemical and biological conditions of soil and water. In humans, the bio-accessibility of inorganic arsenic is 63-99\%. Arsenic is more bio-available from rice than from other foods: different food materials differ in bio-accessible potential. Additionally, the review identifies trends in research on arsenic contamination and food chain flow considering arsenic species, toxicity assessment, and bio-accessibility studies. This systematic review provides a comprehensive assessment of the documented evidence to be used to guide future research on arsenic availability for the rice plant and subsequent availability to humans from cooked rice that can determine arsenic toxicity. The review also highlights how the focus of research on arsenic as a pollutant has changed in the past decades.},

DESIGN: Standardized, systematic evaluation of the literature, categorization of relevant articles according to level of evidence (LOE) and quality (Good, Fair, or Poor), and development of consensus on conclusions via a Delphi-style survey for application of the concepts to clinical practice. SETTINGS: Academic and referral veterinary medical centers. RESULTS: Databases searched included Medline via PubMed and CAB abstracts. Eight different antithrombotic drugs were investigated using a standardized Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) question format both for dogs and cats, including aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin, unfractionated heparin (UFH), dalteparin, enoxaparin, fondaparinux, and rivaroxaban, generating a total of 16 worksheets. Most studies identified were experimental controlled laboratory studies in companion animals (LOE 3) with only four randomized controlled clinical trials in companion animals (LOE 1). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, evidence-based recommendations concerning specific protocols could not be formulated for most antithrombotic drugs evaluated, either because of the wide range of dosage reported (eg, aspirin in dogs) or the lack of evidence in the current literature. However, clopidogrel administration in dogs and cats at risk of arterial thrombosis, notably in cats at risk of cardiogenic thromboembolism, is supported by the literature, and specific protocols were recommended. Comparably, aspirin should not be used as a sole antithrombotic in cats with cardiomyopathy. Using the available safety profile information contained in the literature, the panel reached consensus on suggested dosage schemes for most antithrombotics. Significant knowledge gaps were highlighted, which will hopefully drive novel research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The US Food and Drug Administration warned that exposure of pregnant women to general anaesthetics may impair fetal brain development. This review systematically evaluates the evidence underlying this warning. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched from inception until April 3, 2020. Preclinical and clinical studies were eligible. Exclusion criteria included case reports, in vitro models, chronic exposures, and exposure only during delivery. Meta-analyses were performed on standardised mean differences. The primary outcome was overall effect on learning/memory. Secondary outcomes included markers of neuronal injury (apoptosis, synapse formation, neurone density, and proliferation) and subgroup analyses. RESULTS: There were 65 preclinical studies included, whereas no clinical studies could be identified. Anaesthesia during pregnancy impaired learning and memory (standardised mean difference -1.16, 95\% confidence interval -1.46 to -0.85) and resulted in neuronal injury in all experimental models, irrespective of the anaesthetic drugs and timing in pregnancy. Risk of bias was high in most studies. Rodents were the most frequently used animal species, although their brain development differs significantly from that in humans. In a minority of studies, anaesthesia was combined with surgery. Monitoring and strict control of physiological homeostasis were below preclinical and clinical standards in many studies. The duration and frequency of exposure and anaesthetic doses were often much higher than in clinical routine. CONCLUSION: Anaesthesia-induced neurotoxicity during pregnancy is a consistent finding in preclinical studies, but translation of these results to the clinical situation is limited by several factors. Clinical observational studies are needed. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42018115194.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary nitrate is an important source of nitric oxide (NO), a molecule critical for cardiovascular health. Nitrate is sequentially reduced to NO through an enterosalivary nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway that involves the oral microbiome. This pathway is considered an important adjunct pathway to the classical l-arginine-NO synthase pathway. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to systematically assess the evidence for dietary nitrate intake and improved cardiovascular health from both human and animal studies. DESIGN: A systematic literature search was performed according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines by using key search terms in Medline and EMBASE databases and defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Thirty-seven articles on humans and 14 articles on animals were included from 12,541 screened references. Data on the effects of dietary nitrate on blood pressure, endothelial function, ischemic reperfusion injury, arterial stiffness, platelet function, and cerebral blood flow in both human and animal models were identified. Beneficial effects of nitrate on vascular health have predominantly been observed in healthy human populations, whereas effects in populations at risk of cardiovascular disease are less clear. Few studies have investigated the long-term effects of dietary nitrate on cardiovascular disease clinical endpoints. In animal studies, there is evidence that nitrate improves blood pressure and endothelial function, particularly in animal models with reduced NO bioavailability. Nitrate dose seems to be a critical factor because there is evidence of cross-talk between the 2 pathways of NO production. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for a beneficial effect in humans at risk of cardiovascular disease is limited. Furthermore, there is a need to investigate the long-term effects of dietary nitrate on cardiovascular disease clinical endpoints. Further animal studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms behind the observed effects.},

Thus, in order to search for potential cold-tolerance biomarkers in fish at a post-transcriptional level, the aim of this work is to systematic review current literature on miRNAs related to low temperature in teleost fish and answer the question: are there any miRNAs related to key mechanisms of cold-tolerance in fish? Through a systematic search in 3 different databases, a total of 418 studies were initially identified. After criterious screening, 6 studies were included in the systematic review. At least 71 miRNAs were reported to be differentially expressed (DE) in fish exposed to low temperatures, from which 29 were considered up regulated and 42 down regulated in cold stressed fish. Among the total number of DE miRNAs, 6 were found to be present in at least two studies: miR-9-3p, miR-135c, miR-9-5p, miR-30b, miR-122, miR-92a-3p. DE miRNAs presented in at least two studies were submitted to DIANA mirPath v.3 to identify potential target genes using microT-CDS v 5.0 database. These miRNAs potentially target key regulatory enzymes to glucose and lipid metabolism, controlling the shift in energy metabolism required for cold adaptation. FoxO signaling and circadian cycle are also very likely involved in thermal tolerance mechanisms. These findings represent potential targets for further investigation of microRNA-based predictive tools for fish cold tolerance.},

The therapeutic role of atropine is well-established for patients with acute OP poisoning. The benefit of adding 2-pyridine aldoxime methyl chloride (2-PAM), however, is controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials (RCT) to compare 2-PAM plus atropine in comparison to atropine alone for acute OP poisoning. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS up to March 2017. The Cochrane review handbook was used to assess the risk of bias. Data were abstracted and risk ratios (RR) were calculated for mortality, rate of intubation, duration of intubation, intermediate syndrome, and complications such as hospital-acquired infections, dysrhythmias, and pulmonary edema. We found five studies comprising 586 patients with varying risks of bias. The risk of death (RR = 1.5, 95\% CI 0.9-2.5); intubation (RR = 1.3, 95\% CI 1.0-1.6); intermediate syndrome (RR = 1.6, 95\% CI 1.0-2.6); complications (RR = 1.2, 95\% CI 0.8-1.8); and the duration of intubation (mean difference 0.0, 95\% CI - 1.6-1.6) were not significantly different between the atropine plus 2-PAM and atropine alone.

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to synthesize the literature on consumer preferences for farm animal welfare (FAW), with an emphasis on characterizing consumers based on their FAW preferences. The objective is to provide insights into the salient characteristics associated with animal welfare conscious consumers. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct a systematic review of the results of published research on consumer preferences for FAW. Approximately 350 papers were reviewed, and 52 were included in the analysis. Findings: The authors' review suggests that consumers are not homogenous in their preferences for FAW. The authors identify seven themes that enabled them to characterize consumers with higher FAW preferences. These themes (i.e. age, education and income, gender, country and cross-cultural differences, attitudes and consumer and citizen functions) are grouped under four main headings (socio-demographics, ethics and attitudes, product characteristics and public roles). Research limitations/implications: The authors' synthesis reflects the findings reported in the literature to this date; the identified characteristics may change with time as new evidence becomes available. Practical implications: The information collected in this article would be useful to farmers and food and non-food retailers interested in effective product differentiation and marketing strategies regarding FAW standards. It can also inform policymakers about the state of consumer concerns for FAW. Originality/value: To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first study that attempts to develop a systematic profile of consumers based on their FAW preferences.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Russia is traditionally an endemic area for Taenia saginata infection, where a programme for the prevention of infection has been implemented for sixty years. This paper aims, therefore, to review the recent epidemiology data of Taenia saginata infection in the Russian Federation. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review of published and grey literature, and official data for information on the incidence, prevalence and distribution of Taenia saginata taeniosis and cysticercosis in the Russian Federation between 1st January 1991 and 31st December 2017. RESULTS: From the 404 records returned by our search strategy, we identified 17 official county reports, 17 papers and one meeting abstract on the occurrence of taeniosis or cysticercosis from the Russian Federation, eligible for inclusion in this study. In the Russian Federation, Taenia saginata infection has been continuously present and notifiable in the study period between 1991-2016. In the same area, a continuous decrease in the incidence of human taeniosis cases was observed, from 1.4 to 0.04 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, as well as a reduction in the territory where the infection is reported. The prevalence of bovine cysticercosis, ranging between 0.1-19.0\%, generally has a declining trend, especially after 2005. CONCLUSIONS: Importance of Taenia saginata infection as a medical and veterinary problem has been decreasing in the 21st century but it is still an infection with health and economic impact in the Russian Federation.},

Animal models of mTBI are essential for understanding mechanisms, and pathological outcomes, as well as to test therapeutic interventions. A variety of closed head models of mTBI that incorporate different aspects (i.e., biomechanics) of the mTBI have been reported. The aim of the current review was to compile a comprehensive list of the closed head mTBI rodent models, along with the common data elements, and outcomes, with the goal to summarize the current state of the field. Publications were identified from a search of PubMed and Web of Science and screened for eligibility following PRISMA guidelines. Articles were included that were closed head injuries in which the authors classified the injury as mild in rats or mice. Injury model and animal-specific common data elements, as well as behavioral and histological outcomes, were collected and compiled from a total of 402 articles. Our results outline the wide variety of methods used to model mTBI. We also discovered that female rodents and both young and aged animals are under-represented in experimental mTBI studies. Our findings will aid in providing context comparing the injury models and provide a starting point for the selection of the most appropriate model of mTBI to address a specific hypothesis. We believe this review will be a useful starting place for determining what has been done and what knowledge is missing in the field to reduce the burden of mTBI.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of rodents in Leptospira epidemiology and transmission is well known worldwide. Rats are known to carry different pathogenic serovars of Leptospira spp. capable of causing disease in humans and animals. Wild rats (Rattus spp.), especially the Norway/brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) and the black rat (R. rattus), are the most important sources of Leptospira infection, as they are abundant in urban and peridomestic environments. In this study, we compiled and summarized available data in the literature on global prevalence of Leptospira exposure and infection in rats, as well as compared the global distribution of Leptospira spp. in rats with respect to prevalence, geographic location, method of detection, diversity of serogroups/serovars, and species of rat. METHODS: We conducted a thorough literature search using PubMed without restrictions on publication date as well as Google Scholar to manually search for other relevant articles. Abstracts were included if they described data pertaining to Leptospira spp. in rats (Rattus spp.) from any geographic region around the world, including reviews. The data extracted from the articles selected included the author(s), year of publication, geographic location, method(s) of detection used, species of rat(s), sample size, prevalence of Leptospira spp. (overall and within each rat species), and information on species, serogroups, and/or serovars of Leptospira spp. detected. FINDINGS: A thorough search on PubMed retrieved 303 titles. After screening the articles for duplicates and inclusion/exclusion criteria, as well as manual inclusion of relevant articles, 145 articles were included in this review. Leptospira prevalence in rats varied considerably based on geographic location, with some reporting zero prevalence in countries such as Madagascar, Tanzania, and the Faroe Islands, and others reporting as high as {\textgreater}80\% prevalence in studies done in Brazil, India, and the Philippines. The top five countries that were reported based on number of articles include India (n = 13), Malaysia (n = 9), Brazil (n = 8), Thailand (n = 7), and France (n = 6). Methods of detecting or isolating Leptospira spp. also varied among studies. Studies among different Rattus species reported a higher Leptospira prevalence in R. norvegicus. The serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae was the most prevalent serovar reported in Rattus spp. worldwide. Additionally, this literature review provided evidence for Leptospira infection in laboratory rodent colonies within controlled environments, implicating the zoonotic potential to laboratory animal caretakers. CONCLUSIONS: Reports on global distribution of Leptospira infection in rats varies widely, with considerably high prevalence reported in many countries. This literature review emphasizes the need for enhanced surveillance programs using standardized methods for assessing Leptospira exposure or infection in rats. This review also demonstrated several weaknesses to the current methods of reporting the prevalence of Leptospira spp. in rats worldwide. As such, this necessitates a call for standardized protocols for the testing and reporting of such studies, especially pertaining to the diagnostic methods used. A deeper understanding of the ecology and epidemiology of Leptospira spp. in rats in urban environments is warranted. It is also pertinent for rat control programs to be proposed in conjunction with increased efforts for public awareness and education regarding leptospirosis transmission and prevention.},

We found that SFT was influenced by and increased linearly with hot carcass weights (HCWs) and cold carcass weights (CCWs) and their yields; moreover, the bone fraction decreased whereas the muscle and fat fractions increased with higher levels of SFT. No significant differences were detected in meat quality variables. Thus, SFT appeared to have a direct influence on HCW, CCW, and the weight and yield of bone, muscle, and fat of castrated steers. A uniform fat thickness level of 6.0 mm SFT was determined to be the standard of quality of carcasses and meat products for consumers.},

The aim of this review was to summarize the current knowledge of RFs for AMU in veal calves, pigs and poultry. Thirty-three observational studies were included. Well-identified RFs for an increased AMU are frequent purchase of animals, herd size (large or small depending on the animal species), and a lack of selected biosecurity measures. Also in beef breed calves, more antimicrobials are used than in Holstein calves. AMU is influenced by the farmer, the veterinarian and by the integration. In general, socio-economic RFs are largely unexplored. The causal factors for AMU are multiple and complex, with possible confounding factors and unidentified interactions. Additional knowledge of socio-economic drivers appears particularly urgent to create tailor-made guidelines and awareness campaigns for each sector.},

	abstract = {Snakebite is a Neglected Tropical Disease estimated to cause more than 100,000 human deaths and disable more than 400,000 victims each year. It primarily affects poor agricultural workers, farmers, and cattle herders living in rural areas of developing countries. It is thus an occupational disease. However, the impact of snakebite on these rural communities could be even higher if a One Health approach is taken to consider the direct impact on domestic animals and indirect impact on the livelihood of affected communities. To explore this hypothesis we developed the first scoping review to identify and characterize the global literature on snakebite in domestic animals. Three bibliographic databases (PubMed, Web of Science and Agricola) were searched using terms related to snake, snakebite and domestic animals for publications up to December 31(st), 2016. Two independent reviewers screened publications applying inclusion/exclusion criteria to select relevant material. Relevant information was then extracted from the selected literature. The global literature on snakebite in domestic animals (n = 143 observational studies, reviews and letters) mainly represented North America, Europe and Australia (69\%) with less information from Central and South America, Asia and Africa (31\%). Observational studies (n = 119) mostly concerned pets (78\%) and to a lesser extent livestock (22\%). Thirty-four snake species were reported as responsible for bites in domestic animals. WHO's Medically Important Venomous Snakes were more frequently involved. The social-ecological determinants of snakebite were poorly documented but the reviewed literature suggested a strong seasonality and a diversity of habitat. Snakebite in animals caused neurotoxic, cytotoxic and hemotoxic envenomation syndromes similar to humans and death. Half of publications on envenomed livestock reported a fatality rate above 47\%. There was no literature on the indirect impact of snakebite on livelihood caused by animal morbidity and mortality. The results of this scoping review suggest a high and under-reported burden in terms of mortality in animals and a potential economic impact of snakebite in terms of losses in livelihood of affected communities. However, major knowledge gaps with respect to impact of snakebite on livestock and livelihood were identified. Filling these gaps is necessary for a full understanding of the impact of snakebite and to raise scientific, political and public awareness on this neglected issue.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Coinfection of malaria and intestinal helminths affects one third of the global population, largely among communities with severe poverty. The spread of these parasitic infections overlays in several epidemiological locations and the host shows different outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis determine the pooled prevalence of malaria and intestinal helminthiases coinfections among malaria suspected patients in Ethiopia. METHODS: Primary studies published in English language were retrieved using appropriate search terms on Google Scholar, PubMed/MEDLINE, CINHAL, Scopus, and Embase. The Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) was used for critical appraisal of studies. A pooled statistical meta-analysis was conducted using STATA Version 14.0 software. The heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed using the I2 statistics and Egger's test, respectively. Duval and Tweedie's nonparametric trim and fill analysis using the random-effect analysis. The Random effects model was used to estimate the summary prevalence of comorbidity of malaria and soil transmitted helminthiases and the corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CI). The review protocol has registered in PROSPERO number CRD42019144803. RESULTS: We identified ten studies (n = 6633 participants) in this study. The overall pooled result showed 13\% of the ambulatory patients infected by malaria and intestinal helminths concurrently in Ethiopia. The pooled prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, and mixed infections were 12, 30, and 6\%, respectively. The most common intestinal helminth parasites detected were Hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Tirchuris trichiura. CONCLUSIONS: The comorbidity of malaria and intestinal helminths causes lower hemoglobin level leading to maternal anemia, preterm delivery, and still birth in pregnant women and lactating mother. School-aged children and neonates coinfected by plasmodium species and soil transmitted helminths develop cognitive impairment, protein energy malnutrition, low birth weight, small for gestational age, and gross motor delay. The Ministry of Health of Ethiopia and its international partners working on malaria elimination programs should give more emphasis to the effect of the interface of malaria and soil transmitted helminths, which calls for an integrated disease control and prevention.},

	abstract = {In recent years, and now especially with the arrival of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there has been increased interest in understanding the role of bats in the dynamics of transmission and origin of this pandemic agent. To date, no systematic reviews have been published on this topic. This systematic review aimed to summarize and highlight the frequency of bat infections reported in currently available observational studies for coronavirus. The purpose of this study was also to examine the differences between the pool prevalence by technique and country. We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess coronavirus (CoV) infection in bats and its diagnosis by serological and molecular tests. We carried out random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence and 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI). In all, 824 articles were retrieved (1960-2021). After screening by abstract/title, 43 articles were selected for full-text assessment. Of these, 33 were finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. From the total of studies, the pool prevalence by RT-PCR (n=14,295 bats) for CoV was 9.8\% (95\% CI 8.7-10.9\%); Italy reported the highest pooled prevalence (44.9\%, 95\% CI 31.6-58.1\%), followed by the Philippines (29.6\%). Regarding the ELISA, the pool prevalence for coronavirus from 15 studies, including 359 bats, was 30.2\% (95\% CI 14.7-45.6\%). The results for coronaviruses with the MIF were significantly lower, 2.6\% (95\% CI 1.5-3.7\%). A considerable proportion of infected bats tested positive, particularly by molecular tests. This essential condition highlights the relevance of bats and the need for future studies to detail their role as potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2. In this meta-analysis, bats were positive in almost 10\% by RT-PCR, suggesting their relevance and the need to understand their potential participation in maintaining wild zoonotic transmission.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Coronaviruses are zoonotic viruses that include human epidemic pathogens such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS-CoV), and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus (SARS-CoV), among others (e.g., COVID-19, the recently emerging coronavirus disease). The role of animals as potential reservoirs for such pathogens remains an unanswered question. No systematic reviews have been published on this topic to date. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection in animals and its diagnosis by serological and molecular tests. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence and 95\% confidence interval (95\%CI). RESULTS: 6,493articles were retrieved (1960-2019). After screening by abstract/title, 50 articles were selected for full-text assessment. Of them, 42 were finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. From a total of 34 studies (n=20,896 animals), the pool prevalence by RT-PCR for MERS-CoV was 7.2\% (95\%CI 5.6-8.7\%), with 97.3\% occurring in camels, in which pool prevalence was 10.3\% (95\%CI 8.3-12.3). Qatar was the country with the highest MERS-CoV RT-PCR pool prevalence: 32.6\% (95\%CI 4.8-60.4\%). From 5 studies and 2,618 animals, for SARS-CoV, the RT-PCR pool prevalence was 2.3\% (95\%CI 1.3-3.3). Of those, 38.35\% were reported on bats, in which the pool prevalence was 14.1\% (95\%CI0.0-44.6\%). DISCUSSION: A considerable proportion of infected animals tested positive, particularly by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT). This essential condition highlights the relevance of individual animals as reservoirs of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In this meta-analysis, camels and bats were found to be positive by RT-PCR in over 10\% of the cases for both; thus, suggesting their relevance in the maintenance of wild zoonotic transmission.},

	volume = {14},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0216150},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Paleoparasitology, the study of parasites in the past, brings the knowledge of where and when they occurred in preterit populations. Some groups of parasites, as capillariids, have a complex and controversial systematic, hindering the paleoparasitological diagnosis. In this article, we synthesized the occurrence of capillariids in both the New and the Old World in ancient times, and discussed the difficulty of the diagnosis of species and the strategies for identification. The present review also shows the current status of the phylogeny in capillariids and indicates the necessity to try new approaches for a better understanding of capillariid paleodistribution. METHODS: For the systematic review, a predefined guideline defined by PRISMA was used. The articles collected were identified, screened, and included in the review following criteria for eligibility. The current status of the phylogeny of capillariids was accessed using MUSCLE, Bioedit v.7.0.5 and MEGA v. 7.0.21 programs. RESULTS: The review discussed 38 articles that presented information about capillariids in past populations. Most of capillariid eggs found in the New and Old World were not identified. However, Calodium hepaticum eggs were the most identified, as some from Eucoleus genus. It was observed that sites from the New World had a better chance for capillariid egg identification, due to previous knowledge of its host, when compared to the Old World. In the 18S rDNA phylogenetic analyses, two datasets were constructed, one including sequences from 7 Moravec's genera, where 3 genus-specific clusters, with high bootstrap values, could be observed for Capillaria (ML = 99\%, NJ = 96\%), Eucoleus (ML / NJ = 100\%) and Paratrichosoma (ML / NJ = 100\%). A fourth cluster of 18S rDNA dataset I revealed lack of definition of Pearsonema and Aonchotheca genera. The 18S rDNA dataset II comprised 8 Moravec's genera and defined 3 clusters, 2 genus-specific for Eucoleus (ML = 99\%, NJ = 100\%) and Capillaria (ML / NJ = 98\%). The third 18S rDNA dataset II cluster included 6 genera and exhibited, once again, Pearsonema and Aonchotheca poor discrimination. The cox1 gene data consist of 4 Moravec's genera, and in spite of grouping some species-specific clusters, did not show genera-specific definition. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the numerous archaeological findings, both in the New and the Old Worlds, the identification of capillariid species based on the morphology and morphometry of eggs remains imprecise, often resulting in a generic diagnosis of a group or morphotype of capillariid. Capillariid is one of the most diverse group of helminths recovered in archaeological sites. The phylogenetic trees produced in this study showed limited genetic information available, unresolved genera and incongruence with the classical taxonomy. The elucidation of the paleodistribution of capillariids can give insights of the ancient host-parasite associations but also in modern sceneries.},

	abstract = {Incomplete luteal regression after treatment with a single dose of prostaglandin F(2α) during an Ovsynch protocol decreases fertility to timed artificial insemination (TAI). To increase the proportion of cows with complete luteal regression and subsequently pregnancy per artificial insemination (P/AI), an additional treatment with PGF(2α) 24 h after the first has been recommended. A systematic review of the literature and meta-analytical assessment were performed with the objective of evaluating the effects of adding a second PGF(2α) treatment during the Ovsynch protocol on luteal regression and reproductive performance in lactating dairy cows. Based on the heterogeneity among the experimental treatments, a fixed or a random effects meta-analysis was conducted. Reproductive outcomes of interest were luteal regression at the end of the Ovsynch protocol, and P/AI measured 32 to 39 d after TAI. Seven randomized controlled experiments from 6 published manuscripts including 5,356 cows with the primary objective to evaluate the effect of an additional treatment with PGF(2α) during the Ovsynch protocol on P/AI were used. Information regarding luteal regression at the end of the Ovsynch protocol was available for 1,856 cows. Adding a second PGF(2α) treatment on d 8 during the Ovsynch protocol increased the relative risk (RR) of complete luteal regression at the end of the Ovsynch protocol (RR = 1.14; 95\% confidence interval = 1.10 to 1.17) using a fixed effects model and the RR for pregnancy (RR = 1.14; 95\% confidence interval = 1.06 to 1.22) 32 d after TAI using a fixed effects model. No heterogeneity was observed among the 6 manuscripts regarding complete luteal regression and P/AI. In summary, there was a clear benefit of an additional PGF(2α) treatment during the Ovsynch protocol on luteal regression (+11.6 percentage units) and on P/AI (+4.6 percentage units).},

Luteal presence at the beginning of a TAI protocol and ovarian response after the first gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) injection (G1) affect P4 concentration and subsequently pregnancy per artificial insemination (P/AI). A systematic review of the literature and meta-analytical assessment was performed with the objective of evaluating the magnitude of the effect of luteal presence and ovarian response at the beginning of a TAI protocol on P/AI in lactating dairy cows. We considered only studies using synchronisation protocols consisting of GnRH and prostaglandin F (2α). The time interval between G1 and prostaglandin F (2α) (PGF (2α)) had to range from 5 to 7 d. The time interval between the PGF (2α) injection and G2 had to range from 48 to 72 h. We used 28 controlled experiments from 27 published manuscripts including 16,489 cows with the objective of evaluating the effect size of having a functional corpus luteum (CL) at G1 on P/AI. Information regarding ovulatory response after G1 was available for 5676 cows. In a subset of cows (n = 4291), information was available for luteal presence and ovulatory response at the initiation of the TAI protocol. A functional CL at G1 increased (p {\textless} 0.001) the relative risk of conceiving (RR (relative risk) = 1.32; 95\% CI = 1.21-1.45) in lactating dairy cows. Ovulation after G1 increased (p {\textless} 0.001) the relative risk of conceiving (RR = 1.29; 95\% CI = 1.20-1.38) in lactating dairy cows. The effect of ovulatory response on P/AI after G1 was affected by luteal presence at G1. In summary, there was a clear benefit on P/AI for cows starting a TAI protocol with a functional CL (+10.5 percentage units) and cows ovulating at the beginning of a TAI protocol (+11.0 percentage units).},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in postoperative pain management. While an increasing number of in vitro and animal studies point toward an inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on bone healing process, the few existing retro- and prospective clinical studies present conflicting data. DESIGN: The aim of this qualitative, systematic review was to investigate the impact of perioperative use of NSAIDs in humans on postoperative fracture/spinal fusion healing compared to other used analgesics measured as fracture nonunion with radiological control. PATIENTS/INTERVENTIONS: We performed a systematic literature search of the last 38 years using PubMed Embase and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register including retro- and prospective clinical, human trials assessing the effect of NSAIDs on postoperative fracture/spinal fusion healing when used for perioperative pain management with a radiological follow up to assess eventual nonunion. Due to different study designs, drugs, dosages/exposition times and different methods to assess fracture nonunion, these studies were not pooled for a meta-analysis. A descriptive summary of all studies, level of evidence, study quality and study bias assessment using different scores were used. MAIN RESULTS: Three prospective randomized controlled studies and thirteen retrospective cohort human studies were identified for a total of 12'895 patients. The overall study quality was low according to Jadad and Oxford Levels of Evidence scores. CONCLUSIONS: Published results of human trials did not show strong evidence that NDAIDs for pain therapy after fracture osteosynthesis or spinal fusion lead to an increased nonunion rate. Reviewed studies present such conflicting data, that no clinical recommendation can be made regarding the appropriate use of NSAIDs in this context. Considering laboratory data of animal, human tissue research and recommendation of clinical reviews, a short perioperative exposition to NSAIDs is most likely not deleterious. However, randomized, controlled studies are warranted to support or refute this hypothesis.},

Animal-assisted interventions (AAIs), including interventions involving dog visiting, are increasingly recognized as an innovative approach to ameliorate social, behavioral, psychological, and physical outcomes among older adults. However, available data on their potential to manage depressive symptoms in the aging population are not clear cut. The aim of this review was to conduct a meta-analysis of all prospective controlled studies evaluating the effects of dog visiting on depressive symptoms in older adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted on the electronic databases PubMed and Scopus. Included articles were published between 1980 and 2017 and report controlled empirical studies of dog visiting interventions to ameliorate depressive symptoms in older adults. RESULTS: There was substantial heterogeneity between included studies, which varied in their methodological quality, sample size, and other key features. Notwithstanding such methodological variety, results all go in the same direction and indicate a large beneficial effect of interventions involving dog visiting on depressive symptoms. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This analysis confirms the potential value of dog visiting in ameliorating depressive symptoms in institutionalized and noninstitutionalized older adults. This is in line with previous research indicating AAIs as promising complementary programs for preserving/enhancing emotional and behavioral function in aged individuals. More research is still needed to allow AAIs to be effectively introduced in clinical practice.},

Our research group recently performed a systematic review of reported cell-based-enriching methods for recellularization of ANAs. Recellularization results in consistent improvement of peripheral neuroregeneration compared with plain ANAs. We systematically reviewed the effects on nerve regeneration when ANA enrichment was obtained through biological, chemical, and physical modification instead of cells. METHODS: The PubMed, ScienceDirect, Medline, and Scopus databases were searched for reports of noncellular modification of ANAs, reported from January 2007 to December 2017. The inclusion criteria were English language, noncellular enrichment of ANAs in peripheral nerve regeneration, an in vivo study design, and postgrafting neuroregenerative outcomes assessment. The exclusion criteria were the central nervous system as the site of ANA application, nerve conduits, xenografts, case series, case reports, and reviews. RESULTS: Only animal studies were found to be eligible. We included 16 studies, which were analyzed regarding the animal model, decellularization method, graft-enriching mode, and neuroregenerative tests performed. CONCLUSIONS: Noncellular-based stimulation of ANAs demonstrated positive effects on recovery of nerve function compared with nerve grafting compared with plain ANAs. The neuroregenerative effect of autografting still appeared superior to ANAs, even with noncellular enrichment of ANAs. However, we found that in a few studies, modified ANAs closely approached or even outperformed autografts. Future research should include more preclinical investigations of this promising tool and clinical translation to increase the level of evidence available in the challenging field of peripheral nerve reconstruction.},

After removing duplicates, 327 citations were screened for relevance; of which, 74 articles received full-text reviews.

These documented instances of AdV crossing host species barriers between humans and non-human primate, bat, feline, swine, canine, ovine, and caprine. Eight studies sought to but did not find evidence of zoonosis. The findings demonstrate substantial evidence suggesting AdVs have previously and will continue crossing host species barriers. These have human health consequences both in terms of novel pathogen emergence and epidemic outbreaks, and of appropriate and safe use of non-human adenoviruses for therapeutics. As routine human clinical diagnostics may miss a novel cross-species adenovirus infection in humans, next generation sequencing or panspecies molecular diagnostics may be necessary to detect such incursions.},

	abstract = {The transverse aortic constriction (TAC) model is frequently used to study adverse cardiac remodeling upon pressure overload. We set out to define the most important characteristics that define the degree of cardiac remodeling in this model. A systematic review and meta-analyses were performed on studies using the TAC mouse/rat model and reporting echocardiographic outcome parameters. We included all animal studies in which a constriction around the transverse aorta and at least one of the predefined echocardiography or MRI outcome parameters were assessed. A total of 502 articles and {\textgreater} 3000 wild-type, untreated animals undergoing TAC were included in this study and referenced to a control group. The duration of aortic constriction correlated to the degree of adverse remodeling. However, the mouse data is strongly biased by the preferential use of male C57Bl/6 mice (66\% of studies). Furthermore, mostly ketamine/xylazine anesthetics, 27G needle constriction, and silk sutures are used. Nonetheless, despite the homogeneity in experimental design, the model contained a substantial degree of heterogeneity in the functional outcome measures. When looking at study quality, only 12\% reported randomization, 23\% mentioned any sort of blinding, 25\% adequately addressed the outcomes, and an amazingly low percentage (2\%) showed sample size calculation. Meta-analyses did not detect specific study characteristics that explained the heterogeneity in the reported outcome measures, however this might be related to the strong bias towards the use of specific mouse lines, sex as well as age or to poor reporting of characteristics of study quality.},

	abstract = {To investigate the relationship between faecal calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) excretion in different mammalian species, a meta-analysis on digestibility data derived from the literature was conducted. Seventy-three studies on carnivores, omnivores, large and small hindgut fermenters, ruminants and hippos (a total of 21 mammalian species, precondition for inclusion dietary Ca/P ratio 1.5/1 - 3.0/1) were analysed for Ca and P digestibility. Dietary Ca/P ratios were lower than faecal Ca/P ratios in carnivores, omnivores, ruminants and hippos. In hindgut fermenters, dietary Ca/P ratios were higher than faecal Ca/P ratios, indicating higher intestinal Ca absorption in these species. In all species investigated, there was a significant positive relationship between Ca intake and faecal Ca excretion and between P intake and faecal P excretion. In the biologically relevant range, these equations predicted lower faecal Ca losses in hindgut fermenters than ruminants, for faecal P vice versa. In all species, faecal Ca and P excretion correlated significantly. In carnivores, this highly linear correlation was exceptionally strong (R² = .92). Yet, the linearity of the correlation was questionable in omnivores and ruminants. Possibly, the strong linear correlation of faecal Ca and P excretion in carnivores is due to the formation of insoluble Ca/P complexes in their relatively short and simple gastrointestinal tract. Another hypothesis is that in carnivores, Ca homeostasis relies on modifying bone turnover to a higher degree than on changes in intestinal Ca absorption. For the formation of bone matrix, a constant ratio of Ca and P absorption is of advantage.},

Multiple keywords such as "raw cow milk, heavy metals, and human health" were used to search in related databases. A total of 60 original articles published since 2010 reporting the levels of these metals in raw cow's milk across the world were reviewed. Data showed that the highest levels of Ni (833 mg/L), Pb (60 mg/L), Cu (36 mg/L) were noticed in raw cow milk collected in area consists of granites and granite gneisses in India, while the highest level of Cd (12 mg/L) was reported in barite mining area in India. Fe values in raw cow milk samples were above the WHO maximum limit (0.37 mg/L) with highest values (37.02 mg/L) recorded in India. The highest Al level was (22.50 mg/L) reported for raw cow's milk collected close to food producing plants region in Turkey. The Target Hazard Quotients (THQ) values of Hg were below 1 suggesting that milk consumers are not at a non-carcinogenic risk except in Faisalabad province (Pakistan) where THQ values = 7.7. For the other heavy metals, the THQ values were {\textgreater}1 for Pb (10 regions out of 70), for Cd (6 regions out of 59), for Ni (3 out of 29), and for Cu (3 out of 54). Exposure to heavy metals is positively associated with diseases developments. Moreover, data actualization and continuous monitoring are necessary and recommended to evaluate heavy metals effects in future studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cryptosporidium infection causes gastrointestinal disease and has a worldwide distribution. The highest burden is in developing countries. OBJECTIVES: We sought to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify Cryptosporidium risk factors in Low and Middle Income countries (LMICs). METHODS: Medline Ovid and Scopus databases were searched with no restriction on year or language of publication. All references were screened independently in duplicate and were included if they presented data on at least 3 risk factors. Meta-analyses using random effects models were used to calculate overall estimates for each exposure. RESULTS: The most frequently reported risk factors in the 15 included studies were overcrowding, household diarrhoea, poor quality drinking water, animal contact, open defecation/ lack of toilet and breastfeeding. The combined odds ratio for animal contact was 1.98 (95\%CI: 1.11-3.54) based on 11 studies and for diarrhoea in the household 1.98 (95\%CI: 1.13-3.49) based on 4 studies. Open defecation was associated with a pooled odds ratio of 1.82 (95\%CI: 1.19-2.8) based on 5 studies. Poor drinking water quality was not associated with a significant Cryptosporidium risk, odds ratio 1.06 (95\%CI: 0.77-1.47). Breastfeeding was protective with pooled odds ratio 0.4 (95\%CI: 0.13-1.22), which was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the included studies, crowded living conditions, animal contact and open defecation are responsible for the majority of Cryptosporidium cases in LMICs. Future studies investigating Cryptosporidium risk factors should have a good study design and duration, include appropriate number of cases, select suitable controls, investigate multiple relevant risk factors, fully report data and perform multivariate analysis.},

Consequently, a One Health approach to disease surveillance and control has generated much interest across several disciplines. This systematic review evaluates current global research on the use of domestic dogs as sentinels for human infectious disease, and critically appraises how this may be applied within Canada. Results highlighted a bias in research from high- and middle-income-economy countries, with 35\% of the studies describing data from the Latin America/Caribbean region, 25\% from North America, and 11\% from the European/Central Asia region. Bacteria were the most studied type of infectious agent, followed by protozoa, viruses, helminths, and fungi. Only six out of 142 studies described disease in Canada: four researched a variety of pathogens within Indigenous communities, one researched Borrelia burgdorferi in British Columbia, and one researched arboviruses in Quebec. Results from this review suggest that dogs could provide excellent sentinels for certain infectious-disease pathogens in Canada, yet are currently overlooked. Further research into the use of dog-sentinel surveillance is specifically recommended for California serogroup viruses, Chikungunya virus, West Nile virus, Lyme borreliosis, Rickettsia spp., Ehrlichia spp., and Dirofilaria immitis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The distribution of Taenia saginata in the Americas is unclear. Establishing the distribution, economic burden, and potentials for control of bovine cysticercosis is increasingly important due to the growing demand for beef. This paper aims to take the first step and reviews the recent distribution of T. saginata taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis on a national level within the Americas. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review of published and grey literature for information on the occurrence, prevalence, and geographical distribution of bovine cysticercosis and human taeniosis in the 54 countries and territories of the Americas between January 1st, 1990 and December 31st, 2017. Data on bovine cysticercosis from OIE reports from 1994 to 2005 were also included. RESULTS: We identified 66 papers from the Americas with data on the occurrence of taeniosis or bovine cysticercosis and an additional 19 OIE country reports on bovine cysticercosis. Taeniosis was reported from 13 countries, with nine of these countries reporting specifically T. saginata taeniosis, and four countries reporting non-species specific taeniosis. The reported prevalence of taeniosis ranged between 0.04-8.8\%. Bovine cysticercosis was reported from 19 countries, nine identified through the literature search, and an additional 10 identified through the OIE country reports for notifiable diseases. The reported prevalence of bovine cysticercosis ranged between 0.1-19\%. Disease occurrence was restricted to 21 countries within the Americas, the majority from the mainland, with the only island nations reporting either bovine cysticercosis or taeniosis being Cuba, Haiti, and the US Virgin Islands. CONCLUSIONS: Taenia saginata is widely distributed across 21 of the 54 countries in the Americas, but insufficient epidemiological data are available to estimate the subnational spatial distribution, prevalence, incidence and intensity of infections. This needs to be addressed through active surveillance and disease detection programmes. Such programmes would improve the data quantity and quality, and may enable estimation of the economic burden due to bovine cysticercosis in the region in turn determining the requirement for and cost-effectiveness of control measures.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Working dogs are selected based on predictions from tests that they will be able to perform specific tasks in often challenging environments. However, withdrawal from service in working dogs is still a big problem, bringing into question the reliability of the selection tests used to make these predictions. METHODS: A systematic review was undertaken aimed at bringing together available information on the reliability and predictive validity of the assessment of behavioural characteristics used with working dogs to establish the quality of selection tests currently available for use to predict success in working dogs. RESULTS: The search procedures resulted in 16 papers meeting the criteria for inclusion. A large range of behaviour tests and parameters were used in the identified papers, and so behaviour tests and their underpinning constructs were grouped on the basis of their relationship with positive core affect (willingness to work, human-directed social behaviour, object-directed play tendencies) and negative core affect (human-directed aggression, approach withdrawal tendencies, sensitivity to aversives). We then examined the papers for reports of inter-rater reliability, within-session intra-rater reliability, test-retest validity and predictive validity. CONCLUSIONS: The review revealed a widespread lack of information relating to the reliability and validity of measures to assess behaviour and inconsistencies in terminologies, study parameters and indices of success. There is a need to standardise the reporting of these aspects of behavioural tests in order to improve the knowledge base of what characteristics are predictive of optimal performance in working dog roles, improving selection processes and reducing working dog redundancy. We suggest the use of a framework based on explaining the direct or indirect relationship of the test with core affect.},

We undertook an updated synthesis and meta-analyses on key outcomes for the treatment of calves with HFG. Evaluated outcomes were oocyst shedding, diarrhoea, mortality and weight gain. Experiments had to describe results for same age animals in contemporary arms. Most doses were 100-150 mcg kg-1 day-1. Results were subgrouped by study design, experiments with the lowest risk of bias and lack of industry funding. Eighteen articles were found that described 25 experiments. Most evidence came from randomized controlled trials in Europe. Significantly lower incidence of oocyst shedding, diarrhoea burden and mortality was reported when treatment started before calves were 5 days old. Most studies reported on outcomes for animals up to at least 28 days old. Publication bias was possible in all outcomes and seemed especially likely for diarrhoea outcomes. Beneficial results when HFG treatment was initiated in calves older than 5 days were also found. Prophylactic treatment to prevent cryptosporidiosis is effective in preventing multiple negative outcomes and is beneficial to calf health and will result in a reduction of environmental contamination by Cryptosporidium oocysts.},

No vaccine or cure exists, although symptomatic onset may be delayed with some chemoprophylactics. Other response and management strategies have focused on nutritional status, cleanliness and biosecurity. We undertook a systematic review of observational studies to identify risk or protective factors that could prevent Cryptosporidium parvum infection in calves. Included studies used multivariate analysis within cohort, cross-sectional or case-control designs, of risk factors among young calves, assessing C. parvum specifically. We tabulated data on characteristics and study quality and present narrative synthesis. Fourteen eligible studies were found; three of which were higher quality. The most consistent evidence suggested that risk of C. parvum infection increased when calves had more contact with other calves, were in larger herds or in organic production. Hard flooring reduced risk of infection and calves tended to have more cryptosporidiosis during warm and wet weather. While many other factors were not found to be associated with C. parvum infection, analyses were usually badly underpowered, due to clustering of management factors. Trials are needed to assess effects of manipulating calf contact, herd size, organic methods, hard flooring and temperature. Other factors need to be assessed in larger observational studies with improved disaggregation of potential risk factors.},

DESIGN: The protocols for systematic review were all developed, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses statement and applied to animal research. Reporting of In vivo experiment guidelines for reporting animal research to assess the risk of bias of the studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE through PubMed and manual search from the reference lists of main articles related to the theme. RESULTS: This search strategy identified 65 references, of which 33 were considered inappropriate. The full texts of 32 articles were read, 31 of which did not meet the eligibility criteria and were excluded. The final selection included 1 article for which data was extracted for further evaluation. The article included shows a strongest reaction in the periodontium in front of a secondary occlusal trauma as inflammation and apical migration of the junctional epithelium, bone degradation, and decrease in the quantity of collagen fiber. However, primary occlusal trauma also presents these alterations, with the exception of apical migration of the junctional epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: Although only one study was included in the systematic review of traumatic occlusion, there is some evidence from experimental studies on animals that shows a coherent picture of the effects of traumatic occlusion on the periodontium.

There is growing evidence that supports that the use of probiotics is effective against various diseases, especially in gastrointestinal diseases, including the colorectal cancer, but the differences between the strains, dose, and frequency used are not yet clear. AIMS: To perform a systematic review to compile the results of studies carried out in animal models and investigated the effect of probiotics on colorectal carcinogenesis. METHODS: Studies were selected in PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Search filters were developed using three parameters: probiotics, colorectal cancer, and animal model. RESULTS: From a structured search, we discovered 34 original articles and submitted them to a risk of bias analysis using SYRCLE's tool. The studies show a great diversity of models, most were conducted in rats (55.8\%) and used 1,2 dimethylhydrazine as the drug to induce colorectal carcinogenesis (61.7\%). The vast majority of trials investigated Lactobacillus (64\%) and Bifidobacterium (29.4\%) strains. Twenty-six (86.6\%) studies found significant reduction in lesions or tumors in the animals that received probiotics. The main methodological limitation was the insufficient amount of information for the adequate reproducibility of the trials, which indicated a high risk of bias due to incomplete characterization of the experimental design. CONCLUSIONS: The different probiotics' strains showed anti-carcinogenic effect, reduced the development of lesions and intestinal tumors, antioxidant and immunomodulatory activity, and reduced fecal bacterial enzymes.},

	abstract = {Bone defects following trauma represent a high impact on the quality of life of millions of people around the world. The aim of this study was to review photobiomodulation (PBM) action in the treatment of bone critical defects in rat calvaria, related to evaluation of the current protocols applied. One hundred and forty-seven articles related to the subject were found by searching the main databases (Pubmed, Lilacs, Web of Science, and Scopus) considering the period of publication until the year 2017, and only 14 corresponded the inclusion criteria established for this systematic review. The main parameters of the PBM were expressed in Table 1. In addition, it was possible to observe the use of two different wavelengths (red and infrared), which are considered therapeutic. Most of the evaluated articles presented positive results that describe a greater amount of neoformed bone, an increase in collagen synthesis, and a contribution to microvascular reestablishment. However, two studies report no effect on the repair process when the PBM was used. In addition, we observed considerable variations between the values of power, fluence, and total energy, which make it difficult to compare the results presented between the selected studies. It was possible to conclude that the infrared laser was more effective in positively stimulating the bone repair process of critical defects. Furthermore, a discrepancy was found in the parameter values used, which made it difficult to choose the best protocol for the treatment of this type of lesion.},

	abstract = {Burn is defined as a traumatic injury of thermal origin, which affects the organic tissue. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has gained great prominence as a treatment in this type of injury; however, the application parameters are still controversial in the literature. The aims of this study were to review the literature studies that use LLLT as a treatment in burns conducted in an experimental model, discuss the main parameters used, and highlight the benefits found in order to choose an appropriate therapeutic window to be applied in this type of injury. The selection of the studies related to the theme was carried out in the main databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, LILACS, Web of Science, and Scopus in the period from 2001 to 2017). Subsequently, the articles were then chosen that fell within the inclusion criteria previously established. In the end, 22 were evaluated, and the main parameters were presented. The analyzed studies presented both LLLT use in continuous and pulsed mode. Differences between the parameters used (power, fluence, and total energy) were observed. In addition, the protocols are distinct as to the type of injury and the number of treatment sessions. Among the results obtained by the authors are the improvements in the local microcirculation and cellular proliferation; however, a study reported no effects with LLLT as a treatment. LLLT is effective in accelerating the healing process. However, there is immense difficulty in establishing the most adequate protocol, due to the great discrepancy found in the applied dosimetry values.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pntd.0006364},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is one of the most disabling neglected tropical diseases, ranking second in terms of years lived with disability. While treatment with the drug praziquantel can have immediate beneficial effects, reinfection can occur rapidly if people are in contact with cercaria-infested water. Water treatment for schistosomiasis control seeks to eliminate viable cercariae from water, thereby providing safe alternative water supplies for recreational and domestic activities including laundry and bathing. This provision may reduce contact with infested water, which is crucial for reducing reinfection following chemotherapy and cutting schistosome transmission. METHODOLOGY: A qualitative systematic review was carried out to summarize the existing knowledge on the effectiveness of water treatment in removing or inactivating human schistosome cercariae. Four online databases were searched. Studies were screened and categorized into five water treatment processes: storage, heating, chlorination, filtration, and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection. CONCLUSIONS: All five water treatment methods can remove or inactivate cercariae in water, and hence produce cercaria-free water. However, reliable design guidelines for treating water do not exist as there are insufficient data. Overall, the review found that cercariae are inactivated when storing water for 10-72 hours (depending on temperature), or with chlorination values of 3-30 mg-min/l. UV fluences between 3-60 mJ/cm2 may significantly damage or kill cercariae, and sand filters with 0.18-0.35 mm grain size have been shown to remove cercariae. This systematic review identified 67 studies about water treatment and schistosomiasis published in the past 106 years. It highlights the many factors that influence the results of water treatment experiments, which include different water quality conditions and methods for measuring key parameters. Variation in these factors limit comparability, and therefore currently available information is insufficient for providing complete water treatment design recommendations.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Recurrence after pituitary surgery in Cushing's disease (CD) is a common problem ranging from 5\% (minimum) to 50\% (maximum) after initially successful surgery, respectively. In this review, we give an overview of the current literature regarding prevalence, diagnosis, and therapeutic options of recurrent CD. METHODS: We systematically screened the literature regarding recurrent and persistent Cushing's disease using the MESH term Cushing's disease and recurrence. Of 717 results in PubMed, all manuscripts in English and German published between 1980 and April 2020 were screened. Case reports, comments, publications focusing on pediatric CD or CD in veterinary disciplines or studies with very small sample size (patient number {\textless} 10) were excluded. Also, papers on CD in pregnancy were not included in this review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Because of the high incidence of recurrence in CD, annual clinical and biochemical follow-up is paramount. 50\% of recurrences occur during the first 50 months after first surgery. In case of recurrence, treatment options include second surgery, pituitary radiation, targeted medical therapy to control hypercortisolism, and bilateral adrenalectomy. Success rates of all these treatment options vary between 25 (some of the medical therapy) and 100\% (bilateral adrenalectomy). All treatment options have specific advantages, limitations, and side effects. Therefore, treatment decisions have to be individualized according to the specific needs of the patient.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Several different animal models are used to study disuse-induced bone loss. This systematic review aims to give a comprehensive overview of the animal models of disuse-induced bone loss and provide a detailed narrative synthesis of each unique animal model. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were systematically searched for animal models of disuse from inception to November 30, 2019. In addition, Google Scholar and personal file archives were searched for relevant publications not indexed in PubMed or Embase. Two reviewers independently reviewed titles and abstracts for full-text inclusion. Data were extracted using a predefined extraction scheme to ensure standardization. RESULTS: 1964 titles and abstracts were screened of which 653 full-text articles were included. The most common animal species used to model disuse were rats (59\%) and mice (30\%). Males (53\%) where used in the majority of the studies and genetically modified animals accounted for 7\%. Twelve different methods to induce disuse were identified. The most frequently used methods were hindlimb unloading (44\%), neurectomy (15\%), bandages and orthoses (15\%), and botulinum toxin (9\%). The median time of disuse was 21 days (quartiles: 14 days, 36 days) and the median number of animals per group subjected to disuse was 10 (quartiles: 7, 14). Random group allocation was reported in 43\% of the studies. Fewer than 5\% of the studies justified the number of animals per group by a sample size calculation to ensure adequate statistical power. CONCLUSION: Multiple animal models of disuse-induced bone loss exist, and several species of animals have successfully been studied. The complexity of disuse-induced bone loss warrants rigid research study designs. This systematic review emphasized the need for standardization of animal disuse research and reporting.},

	abstract = {Currently, the deployment of tracking devices is one of the most frequently used approaches to study movement ecology of birds. Recent miniaturization of light-level geolocators enabled studying small bird species whose migratory patterns were widely unknown. However, geolocators may reduce vital rates in tagged birds and may bias obtained movement data. There is a need for a thorough assessment of the potential tag effects on small birds, as previous meta-analyses did not evaluate unpublished data and impact of multiple life-history traits, focused mainly on large species and the number of published studies tagging small birds has increased substantially. We quantitatively reviewed 549 records extracted from 74 published and 48 unpublished studies on over 7,800 tagged and 17,800 control individuals to examine the effects of geolocator tagging on small bird species (body mass {\textless}100 g). We calculated the effect of tagging on apparent survival, condition, phenology and breeding performance and identified the most important predictors of the magnitude of effect sizes. Even though the effects were not statistically significant in phylogenetically controlled models, we found a weak negative impact of geolocators on apparent survival. The negative effect on apparent survival was stronger with increasing relative load of the device and with geolocators attached using elastic harnesses. Moreover, tagging effects were stronger in smaller species. In conclusion, we found a weak effect on apparent survival of tagged birds and managed to pinpoint key aspects and drivers of tagging effects. We provide recommendations for establishing matched control group for proper effect size assessment in future studies and outline various aspects of tagging that need further investigation. Finally, our results encourage further use of geolocators on small bird species but the ethical aspects and scientific benefits should always be considered.},

Anastomotic leakage following colorectal surgery is a major complication with a high incidence and mortality. Adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) may be associated with reduction of anastomotic leakage. A systematic review was conducted regarding HBOT as an adjunctive therapy to colorectal surgery. METHODS: Systematic review (1900-2017) using PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, Web of Science and EMCARE. All original published studies on the effect of HBOT as an adjunctive therapy for colorectal surgery with the creation of an anastomosis were considered. RESULTS: Thirteen small animal trials were included for qualitative synthesis. We found no human trials. Eleven trials used bursting pressure whilst eight used hydroxyproline levels as a marker for collagen synthesis as primary outcome to assess the strength of the anastomosis. A meta-analysis performed for normal and ischaemic anastomoses showed that postoperative HBOT improves bursting pressure and hydroxyproline levels significantly in both normal (p ≤ 0.001 and p = 0.02) and ischaemic anastomoses (p ≤ 0.001 and p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Postoperative HBOT has a positive effect on colorectal anastomoses in rats. Further research should focus on a larger systematic animal study.},

	abstract = {As training in microvascular surgery often involves the use of live animals, it is important that such a practice is regularly revisited and justified, particularly in the context of emerging training strategies such as virtual simulation. This systematic review was therefore designed to assess the ongoing need for their use over other methods. A search of PubMed and MEDLINE using the major MeSH terms: anastomosis, surgical vascular procedures, microsurgery, and training, yielded 1386 titles from which 153 abstracts were read, 70 papers analysed, and 17 included. Nine of these papers were randomised studies that compared different methods of training. Other publications were included if the use of live animals was assessed or commented upon, or both (8 publications). Only one study randomised trainees to a non-living animal model or a living model, with detailed assessment that included clinical transfer to live surgery. It showed no significant difference in the quality of training, and excellent techniques of assessment. There was much discussion on the advantage of regular training and opportunities to practise without tuition, but there was no clear advantage for the use of live animals. Our review emphasises the lack of evidence regarding the need for live animals in the training of microsurgical or microvascular skills. Although the assumption remains that the use of live rats is essential, there is a clear need for a high-quality, comparative study to justify the continued use of such models given the quality of the alternatives now available.},

The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the effect of nanoparticles as a treatment alone in non-surgical periodontal therapy in animal models. A systematic search was conducted in Medline/PubMed, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library and Science Direct. The eligibility criteria were: studies (i) using nanoparticles as chemotherapeutic agent or as delivery system; (ii) including preclinical controlled animal model (experimental periodontitis); (iii) reporting alveolar bone loss; (iv) written in English; and (v) published up to June 2019. Risk of bias was evaluated according to the SYstematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation. On the 1324 eligible studies, 11 were included. All reported advantages in using nanoparticles for the treatment of periodontitis, highlighted by a reduction in bone loss. Agents modulating inflammation seem to be more relevant than antibiotics, in terms of efficiency and risk of antibiotic resistance. In addition, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) or drugs used as their own carrier appear to be the most interesting nanoparticles in terms of biocompatibility. Risk of bias assessment highlighted many criteria scored as unclear. There are encouraging preclinical data of using nanoparticles as a contribution to the treatment of periodontitis.},

Based on the current data, ingestion of 90-140 mg day(-1) of isolated L-leucine in diet-induced obesity (DIO) models shows improvement in metabolic markers if offered during the development of the metabolic disorder in almost all the studies, but not after. Branched-chain amino acid supplementation was effective in streptozotocin-induced β-cells death but not in DIO models.

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Treatment of acute organophosphorus or carbamate insecticide self-poisoning is often ineffective, with tens of thousands of deaths occurring every year. Researchers have recommended the addition of magnesium sulfate or calcium channel blocking drugs to standard care to reduce acetylcholine release at cholinergic synapses. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to review systematically the evidence from preclinical studies in animals exposed to organophosphorus or carbamate insecticides concerning the efficacy of magnesium sulfate and calcium channel blocking drugs as therapy compared with placebo in reducing mortality or clinical features of poisoning. We also systematically reviewed the evidence from clinical studies in patients self-poisoned with organophosphorus or carbamate insecticides concerning the efficacy of magnesium sulfate and calcium channel blocking drugs as therapy compared with placebo, in addition to standard therapy, in reducing mortality, atropine requirement, need for intubation and ventilation, and intensive care unit and hospital stay. METHODS: We performed a systematic review for articles on magnesium sulfate and calcium channel blocking drugs in organophosphorus or carbamate insecticide poisoning using PubMed and China Academic Journals Full-text (Medicine/Hygiene Series) databases and keywords: "organophosphorus or organophosphate poisoning", "cholinesterase inhibitor poisoning" OR "carbamate poisoning" AND "magnesium", "calcium channel blocker", or generic names of different calcium channel blocking drugs. Review of titles and abstracts revealed 2262 papers of potential relevance. After review of the full papers, a total of 19 papers relevant to the question were identified: five preclinical studies, nine case reports or small case series, and five clinical studies and trials. We also obtained primary data from three unpublished clinical trials of magnesium sulfate, providing data from a total of eight clinical studies and trials for analysis. All studies were of organophosphorus insecticides; no studies of carbamates were found. No pre-clinical or clinical studies of calcium channel blocking drugs and magnesium sulfate in combination were found. We extracted data on study type, treatment regimens, outcome, and side effects. Pre-clinical studies: Two rodent studies indicated a benefit of calcium channel blocking drugs treatment on mortality if given before or soon after organophosphorus exposure, in addition to atropine and/or oxime. In poisoned minipigs, treatment with magnesium sulfate after organophosphorus insecticide poisoning reduced cholinergic stimulation and hypertension. Of note, magnesium sulfate further suppressed serum butyrylcholinesterase activity in one rat study. Observational clinical studies: Calcium channel blocking drugs and magnesium sulfate have been used to treat cardiac dysrhythmias and hypertonic uterine contractions in organophosphorus poisoned patients. A small neurophysiological study of magnesium sulfate reported reversion of neuromuscular junction effects of organophosphorus insecticide exposure. Comparative clinical studies: Only four of eight studies were randomized controlled trials; all studies were of magnesium sulfate, of small to modest size, and at substantial risk of bias. They included 441 patients, with 239 patients receiving magnesium sulfate and 202 control patients. The pooled odds ratios for magnesium sulfate for mortality and need for intubation and ventilation for all eight studies were 0.55 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.32-0.94) and 0.52 (95\% CI 0.34-0.79), respectively. However, there was heterogeneity in the results of higher quality phase III randomized controlled trials providing more conservative estimates. Although a small dose-escalation study suggested benefit from higher doses of magnesium sulfate, there was no evidence of a dose effect across the studies. Adverse effects were reported rarely, with 11.1\% of patients in the randomized controlled trials receiving the highest dose of magnesium sulfate requiring their infusion to be stopped due to hypotension. CONCLUSIONS: Both preclinical and clinical data suggest that magnesium sulfate and calcium channel blocking drugs might be promising adjunct treatments for acute organophosphorus insecticide poisoning. However, evidence is currently insufficient to recommend their use. Mechanistic and large multi-center randomized controlled trials testing calcium channel blocking drugs and magnesium sulfate are required to provide the necessary evidence, with careful identification of the insecticides ingested and measurement of surrogate markers of toxicity, including butyrylcholinesterase activity.},

	abstract = {Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is one of the most common calfhood diseases in dairy cattle. Unfortunately, published data on the short- and long-term effects of calfhood BRD on health and performance are scarce and, when available, often conflicting and uncertain. The objective of this study was therefore to review the scientific literature on the effects of calfhood BRD on health and performance of dairy cattle and summarize the research findings using a meta-analysis approach. The systematic review and meta-analysis were performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed and CAB Abstract databases were screened for relevant studies that were published in English (until February 3, 2020). Only studies reporting naturally occurring BRD cases from birth to 12 mo of age in dairy calves in Europe and North America were considered eligible. Both observational studies and randomized controlled trials were included. Random-effect meta-analysis models were used to quantify the effect of BRD on outcomes for which at least 5 studies reported a numeric estimation of the effect of BRD. From an initial pool of 525 references, 27 full-text articles with original data were included in the manuscript. Meta-analysis models were prepared for 4 outcomes: odds of mortality (n = 7 studies), odds of herd removal before first calving (n = 5 studies), average daily gain (n = 10 studies), and milk production during first lactation (n = 5 studies). In these models, heifers diagnosed with BRD during calfhood had 2.85 times higher odds of dying (95\% confidence interval: 1.22 to 6.69) and 2.30 times higher odds of herd removal (i.e., dead, culled, or sold) before the first calving (95\% confidence interval: 1.75 to 3.03) compared with heifers not diagnosed with this condition. Heifers experiencing calfhood BRD also had an average daily gain reduced by 0.067 kg/d (95\% confidence interval: -0.099 to -0.034) and they produced 121.2 kg (95\% confidence interval: -184.9 to -57.5) less milk during their first lactation. Other health and performance outcomes, such as age at first calving and odds of not finishing the first lactation, were also investigated but not summarized using a meta-analysis approach. Pooled estimates obtained in the present study may provide more accurate estimates of the overall economic losses associated with calfhood BRD in dairy cattle.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is used in various areas including veterinary medicine. The assessment of the quality of systematic review and meta-analyses (SR-MA) despite their importance in the EBM process is uncommonly performed in veterinary medicine due to the absence of specific dedicated tools. The main objective of this observational study was to examine the extent and nature of SR-MA that can be available online to an equine or bovine veterinarian. Secondary objectives included: (1) to determine if A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool can be used for equine and bovine SR-MA methodological assessment and if it has a satisfactory interrater reliability in a subsample of these SR-MA and (2) to appraise the completeness of abstract reporting of this sample. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A scoping review using equine and bovine medical science SR-MA retrieved from PubMed was performed. A sub-sample of these reviews (n = 30) were independently assessed by 3 different raters using the AMSTAR tool validated for medical reviews. The completeness of abstract reporting was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. RESULTS: Ten and 168 SR-MA were retrieved for equine and bovine species respectively. For bovine SR-MA, 93 reviews were about nutrition and metabolism topic. On the 30 SR-MA subsamples, with 10 equine and 20 bovine SR-MA randomly chosen for AMSTAR assessment, the median interrater agreement (Kappa) was 0.60 (interquartile range: 0.36-0.71) depending on AMSTAR item and pairs of raters. When focusing on the total score of AMSTAR, the inter-observer intra-class correlation coefficient was very good (0.85, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.74-0.92). The AMSTAR items that were unfrequently reported (33\% or less of reviews) were "a priori" protocol of SR-MA specification, complete report of the list of studies (included and excluded studies), quality assessment of the included studies, publication bias assessment and conflict of interest (reported either for included studies and for SR-MA authors). Abstracts reporting quality was low with a median percentage of complete reported items of 33\% (range: 8-58\%) CONCLUSIONS: In large animal veterinary medicine, SR-MA are uncommonly performed in equine and bovine medicine. The SR-MA can be assessed using AMSTAR with acceptable inter-rater reliability, which is helpful to assess SR-MA methodological quality.},

IgG can also be measured indirectly by methods such as serum refractometry (REF) or Brix refractometry (BRIX). OBJECTIVES: To determine the accuracy of REF and BRIX for assessment of inadequate transfer of passive immunity (ITPI) in calves. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies. METHODS: Databases (PubMed and CAB Abstract, Searchable Proceedings of Animal Science) and Google Scholar were searched for relevant studies. Studies were eligible if the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of REF or BRIX was determined using direct measurement of IgG by RID or turbidimetry as the reference standard. The study population included calves {\textless}14 days old that were fed with natural colostrum (colostrum replacement products were excluded). Quality assessment was performed by the QUADAS-2 tool. Hierarchical models were used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: From 1,291 references identified, 13 studies of 3,788 calves were included. Of these, 11 studies evaluated REF and 5 studies evaluated BRIX. The median (range) prevalence of ITPI (defined as calves with IgG {\textless}10 g/L by RID or TIA) was 21\% (1.3-56\%). Risk of bias and applicability concerns were generally low or unclear. For REF, summary estimates were obtained for 2 different cutoffs: 5.2 g/dL (6 studies) and 5.5 g/dL (5 studies). For the 5.2 g/dL cutoff, the summary sensitivity (95\% CI) and specificity (95\% CI) were 76.1\% (63.8-85.2\%) and 89.3\% (82.3-93.7\%), and 88.2\% (80.2-93.3\%) and 77.9\% (74.5-81.0\%) for the 5.5 g/dL cutoff. Due to the low number of studies using the same cutoffs, summary estimates could not be obtained for BRIX. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Despite their widespread use on dairy farms, evidence about the optimal strategy for using refractometry, including the optimal cutoff, are sparse (especially for BRIX). When using REF to rule out ITPI in herds, the 5.5 g/dL cutoff may be used whereas for ruling in ITPI, the 5.2 g/dL cutoff may be used.},

	abstract = {Inadequate transfer of passive immunity (TPI) is associated with increased risk for calfhood disease and increased risk of mortality and morbidity. Accurately diagnosing calves and herds with inadequate TPI is of primary importance and brix (BRIX) or classical refractometer (REF) devices are more practical for this purpose than measuring the serum immunoglobulin G concentration in neonatal calves. We previously reported a systematic review and meta-analysis for quantifying the pooled accuracy of BRIX and REF for detecting calves with serum IgG {\textless} 10 g/L noting that sparse data were available especially because studies did not report the same thresholds. We updated the previous systematic review using different methods that accounted for the test results distribution in calves with or without inadequate TPI. With this approach, all reported cut-offs for a specific study are used in that Bayesian approach that quantifies how accuracy varied among all reported thresholds. Five new manuscripts were included, which represented 4 new studies since the initial study was performed. A total of 11 REF and 9 BRIX studies were available. The meta-analytic methods allowed reporting variation of the true and false positive rate across and among all reported cut-offs. Pooled points estimates (95 \% Bayesian credible intervals) for sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of REF {\textless} 5.5 g/L were 86.1 \% (68.5-97.9\%) and 76.2 \% (65.9-88.4\%) whereas BRIX {\textless} 8.4 \% was associated with Se of 91.6 \% (77.2-99.5\%) and Sp of 88.2 \% (65.4-99.8\%). Interestingly, the accuracy (Se + Sp-1) was generally higher for BRIX than for REF at the reported cut-offs. Besides the benefit of providing pooled estimates for all reported and unreported BRIX and REF thresholds, the general framework used in this study could potentially be used in many veterinary diagnostic tests studies that reported multiple thresholds accounting for potentially different tests distributions in population with and without the target condition.},

This role is defined in part by federal regulations, policies, and guidelines that prescribe the establishment and function of these committees. Often, IACUC administrators are expected to evaluate IACUC performance to ensure that committees execute these functions effectively, and in a manner that is suitable to the institution. However, methods for IACUC performance evaluation have not been well described in the peer-reviewed literature. To address this deficit, we conducted a systematic review using MEDLINE to identify methods that have been used to assess IACUCs. The scope of this review was intentionally broad to capture evaluation methods used by other institutional committees with similar responsibilities in overseeing research conduct, including animal ethics committees (AECs), institutional biosafety committees (IBCs), and institutional review boards (IRBs). Over 100 publications that included empirical evaluation methods were identified, although only 17 evaluated IACUCs in the United States. A substantial number of the studies used qualitative methods, such as surveys or questionnaires, interviews, and observations. The IACUC functions and characteristics most often assessed in the 17 publications included components of the protocol review processes and committee membership. We compiled this information to offer IACUC administrators a source of methodologies that can be incorporated into quality improvement and IACUC performance evaluation efforts. We also suggest ways in which organizations may evaluate IACUCs using methods described in the literature for other types of committees.},

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: A broad bibliographic search was performed in three online databases through March 2020 for publications on postoperative antibiotic use after TPLO in dogs. Search terms included dog, canine, TPLO, tibial plateau leveling osteotomy, infection, antibiotic, and antimicrobial. Articles that met inclusion criteria were evaluated for level of evidence (LoE) by a modified Oxford Level of Evidence (mOLE) and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) classification and evaluation. RESULTS: Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Effect of antibiotic use was the primary question in four studies. Among those, 50\% (2/4) were assigned a mOLE of 1b and a GRADE of moderate, while the other 50\% (2/4) were assigned a mOLE of 4b or 4c with a GRADE of low. The two studies with the highest LoE did not provide evidence of the benefit of antibiotic usage. Results of only one study provided evidence to support the use of postoperative antibiotics. The remaining nine studies provided evaluation of antibiotic use secondarily and were all assigned a low LoE. Among these, 78\% (7/9) provided evidence to support the use of postoperative antibiotics. CONCLUSION: We found little evidence to support the use of postoperative antibiotics to reduce the risk of surgical site infections in dogs after TPLO. The answer to this clinical question is complicated by the lack of prospective studies and inconsistent treatment protocols in the evaluated studies. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The clinical impact of postoperative antibiotic administration on infection rates after TPLO is uncertain.},

Statistical analysis was used in ten studies, of which one assessed the effect of multiple sources using modelling approaches; none reported effect measures. Most studies reported higher ARB prevalence or concentration downstream/near the source. However, this evidence was primarily descriptive and it could not be concluded that there is a clear impact of point sources on increases in ARB in the environment. To quantify increases in ARB in the environment due to specific point sources, there is a need for studies that stress study design, control of biases and analytical tools to provide effect measure estimates.},

The objective of this review is to provide a systematic evaluation of the evidence and a meta-analysis of data from previously published researches on the antidiabetic action of quercetin. A comprehensive literature search was conducted between July 2018 and August 2018 on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Sciences and Scopus databases. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled effect size and studies were weighted according to an estimate of the mean difference. The heterogeneity between studies was assessed using a Higgins' I2 test with corresponding p values. Overall 13 eligible articles with appropriate data on serum glucose were included in the statistical analysis. The meta-analysis for serum glucose level (mg/dL) showed that at doses of 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg there was a significant difference between the means. Therefore, the results of the meta-analysis support the hypothesis that quercetin lowers serum glucose level, at doses of 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg.},

Moreover, a meta-analysis of the effect of TQ on BW demonstrated that TQ has a statistically significant effect on the BW of diabetic animals with an overall pooled SMD of 4.509 (95\%CI: 3.234, 5.784; p = 0.000). In addition, the overall pooled estimate of the level of serum insulin was significant with SMD of 1.681 (95\%CI: 0.858, 2.503; p = 0.000). Therefore, the meta-analysis showed that TQ has a significant antidiabetic effect through its action on the SG, serum insulin level, and BW of the animals.},

Chitosan-, alginate-, and a combination of chitosan and alginate-based scaffolds showed good intervention effects on wound healing. Chitosan-based scaffolds were effective in diabetic skin wound healing. The effects of alginate and the combination of chitosan-and alginate-based scaffolds on diabetic skin wounds still need more research. However, due to the heterogeneity of animal and cell preclinical trials and the validity of the statistical analysis used in these studies, it is necessary to conduct a thorough study using well-designed experiments to confirm these results.

	abstract = {Cryptosporidium is the causative agent of cryptosporidiosis. Cryptosporidium not only has a worldwide distribution, but also can infect various hosts, including dairy cattle and humans. Although numerous researches on Cryptosporidium infection in cattle have been conducted, no nationwide study on the prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection in dairy cattle in mainland China was carried out. In this meta-analysis, five databases, including PubMed, ScienceDirect, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chongqing VIP, and Wanfang, were used to search for published papers regarding Cryptosporidium infection in dairy cattle in China from inception to February 25, 2019. Our study obtained 60 eligibility studies that reported Cryptosporidium infection in dairy cattle. We estimated the pooled Cryptosporidium prevalence to be 17.0\% (3,901/33,313), with 16.9\% (722/5,191) in Central China, 17.4\% (959/6,162) in Eastern China, 29.8\% (404/2,021) in Northeastern China, 15.7\% (227/2,344) in Northern China, 15.8\% (1,042/11,452) in Northwestern China, 9.5\% (494/5,758) in Southern China, and 13.7\% (53/385) in Southwestern China. The pooled prevalence of Cryptosporidium in before 2000 group (28.0\%, 944/3,417) was significantly higher than in 2000-2010 group (11.1\%, 384/3,643) and after 2010 group (13.7\%, 2,134/22,411). Cattle with the age of ≤ 12 months (22.5\%, 2,142/12,948) had a significantly higher prevalence than those of {\textgreater} 12 months (9.5\%, 840/10,282). The pooled prevalence of Cryptosporidium in different seasons ranged from 8.2\% (343/4,552) in Autumn to 19.5\% (285/1,570) in Winter. Diarrhea cattle (38\%, 133/477) had a higher Cryptosporidium prevalence than non-diarrhea cattle (13.0\%, 367/2423). The pooled prevalence of Cryptosporidium in different provinces was various, with the highest (35.6\%, 355/1,667) in Heilongjiang province, and the lowest (4.3\%, 15/440) in Tianjin province. The univariate meta-regression analyses indicated that the collection year (P = 0.002) and age of cattle (P = 0.001) might be sources of heterogeneity. This systematic review suggests that China is a country where cryptosporidiosis frequently occurs in cattle. Due to the particular relationship between dairy cattle and feeder, further research is required to investigate the links between cattle ownership and Cryptosporidium infection.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are limited findings from low-powered studies based on few number of subjects with equine asthma. Furthermore, no studies have been performed to assess a meaningful clinically detectable impact of corticosteroids in equine asthma. OBJECTIVES: To assess and compare the clinical effect of inhaled and systemic corticosteroids in equine asthma and identify a quantitative clinical score suitable to assess the Minimal Important Difference (MID), expressed as the Minimally Clinically Detectable Difference (MCDD). STUDY DESIGN: Pair-wise and network meta-analysis. METHODS: Literature searches for studies on corticosteroid therapy in equine asthma were performed. The risk of publication bias was assessed by Funnel plots and Egger's test. The effect on changes in clinical scores vs. control was analysed via random-effects models and Bayesian networks. RESULTS: Corticosteroids significantly improved the clinical condition (Standardised Mean Difference: -1.52, 95\% CrI -2.07 to -0.98; P{\textless}0.001 vs. control). No difference was detected between inhaled and systemic corticosteroids with regard to the changes in clinical scores (Relative Effect: 0.08, 95\% CrI -1.45 to 1.32; P = 0.8). An Improved clinically Detectable Equine Asthma Scoring System (IDEASS) indicated that corticosteroids improved the clinical condition of asthmatic horses by 30\% compared with controls (IDEASS value: -2.36, 95\% CI -3.39 to -1.33; P{\textless}0.001). A one-point change in IDEASS represented the MCDD in equine asthma. MAIN LIMITATIONS: Moderate quality of evidence for systemic corticosteroids. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled corticosteroids are effective in improving the clinical condition of horses with equine asthma and prevent exacerbations. Systemic corticosteroids should be used only in selected cases with symptomatic airway hyperresponsiveness during exacerbation. IDEASS requires further validation but may represent a suitable approach to rank the level of asthma severity and assess the clinical effect of pharmacotherapy in horses with equine asthma.},

	doi = {10.1093/nutrit/nuy029},
	abstract = {CONTEXT: Omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid, demonstrate possible beneficial effects as adjuvants in cancer treatment. One mechanism seems to be related to alterations in the redox status of cancer cells. Such alterations are thought to act in synergy with conventional anticancer agents. OBJECTIVE: This review examines published data on the effects of cotreatment with anticancer agents and n-3 PUFAS on oxidative stress parameters to determine whether any patterns of oxidative stress alterations can be identified. DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of MEDLINE (via PubMed) was conducted to identify articles published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese until November 2017. STUDY SELECTION: The following inclusion criteria were applied: (1) individuals or animals with cancer or malignant cell lines supplemented with some source of n-3 PUFAs; (2) concomitant use of anticancer treatment; and (3) evaluation of oxidative stress-related variables. DATA EXTRACTION: A standardized outline was used to extract the following data: study type, supplement used, type of cells, tumor or patient characteristics, study design, anticancer treatment used, and oxidative stress-related outcomes. RESULTS: After the literature search and screening of 1563 citations, 28 studies were included for data extraction and evaluation: 16 in vitro studies (2 of which also used in vivo studies), 8 animal studies, and 4 human studies (3 clinical trials and 1 case series). In most in vitro and animal studies, intervention groups receiving cotreatment with n-3 PUFAs showed enhanced lipid peroxidation and cytotoxicity compared with groups receiving anticancer treatment alone. Eleven of the 12 studies that investigated the effect of vitamin E on the sensitivity of cancer cells to the oxidative stress caused by n-3 PUFAs showed that vitamin E abolished the positive effects of cotreatment. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in oxidative stress caused by cotreatment with anticancer agents and n-3 PUFAs can exert positive effects on the efficacy of conventional treatment. This seems to occur in most cells and tumors tested thus far, but not all. Identifying tumors that are sensitive to these oxidative effects may provide support for the rational use of n-3 PUFAs as an adjuvant treatment in specific types of cancer.},

	abstract = {Background: The emergence and re-emergence of vector-borne and other infectious diseases of poverty pose a threat to the health of populations living in urban and low-income settings. A detailed understanding of intervention strategies, including effectiveness of past outbreak containment, is necessary to improve future practices. The objective was to determine what is known about the effectiveness of containment measures for emerging and re-emerging vector-borne and other infectious diseases of poverty in urban settings and identify research gaps and implications for public health practice. Main body: We conducted a scoping review and systematically searched peer-reviewed and grey literature published between 2000 and 2016. Different data extraction tools were used for data coding and extraction, and data on implementation process and transferability were extracted from all studies. A quality assessment was conducted for each included study. We screened 205 full-text articles and reports for a total of 31 articles included in the review. The quality of the studies was generally low to moderate. The largest body of evidence concerned control activities for Ebola virus and dengue fever. The majority of interventions (87\%) relied on multiple types of measures, which were grouped into four categories: (1) healthcare provision; (2) epidemiological investigation and/or surveillance; (3) environmental or sanitary interventions; and (4) community-based interventions. The quality of the majority of studies (90\%) was poor or moderate, and one-third of the studies did not provide a clear description of the outcomes and of the procedures and/or tools used for the intervention. Conclusions: Our results highlight the difficulty of establishing causation when assessing the effect of containment measures. Studies that extend beyond solely reporting on effectiveness and take into account the complexity of real-world settings are urgently needed. We recommend the allocation of research efforts to the evaluation of the implementation processes of interventions as well as their comprehensive and systematic description using validated checklists.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal parasites like nematodes are associated with significant impacts on animal health, causing poor growth rates, diseases and even death. Traditional parasite control includes the use of anthelmintic drugs, albeit being associated with drug resistance and ecotoxicity. In the last decade, biological control of parasites using nematophagous or predatory fungi has been increasingly studied, although systematic evidence of its efficacy is still lacking. The aim of this work was to assess the evidence of efficacy of nematophagous fungi in the control of nematodes and other gastrointestinal parasites in different animal species. METHODS: Using the PICO method (Population, Intervention, Comparison and Outcomes), we performed a systematic review on the subject to search for original papers published between January 2006 and October 2019, written in English, and indexed in PubMed/Medline. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms were used in the syntax. Papers were selected for detailed review based on title and abstract. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, and relevant data were collected from the remaining papers. RESULTS: The literature search retrieved 616 papers. Eighty-nine were submitted to a detailed review. In the end, 53 papers were included in the analysis. The studies were very heterogeneous, using different fungi, doses, frequency of administration, duration of treatment, host animals, and target parasites. Considering the 53 papers, 44 studies (83 \% of the interventions) showed efficacy, with only 9 studies (17 \%) showing no significant differences when compared to control. CONCLUSION: With the increasing hazards of drug resistance and ecotoxicity, biological control with predatory fungi stands out as a good tool for future parasite management, whether as a complementary treatment or as an alternative to standard parasite control.},

	abstract = {Histoplasmosis is the most clinically significant mycosis in Latin America; still it has been neglected in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). There is limited information about its contribution to morbidity and mortality in this population. We conducted a systematic review of scientific literature to provide an estimation of the frequency and mortality of histoplasmosis among people with HIV receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in Latin America, and factors associated with mortality. We searched articles in PubMed, Scopus, WHO Global health library, and Scielo using different combination of terms including "histoplasmosis" and HAART. We identified 949 articles, removed 662 duplicated; screened 287 abstracts; reviewed full text of 53 articles; and selected 15 articles that provided information on the number of patients studied, included patients receiving ART, and reported any measure of frequency estimate for qualitative synthesis. Studies were conducted in Argentina (n = 4), Brazil (n = 6), Colombia (n = 2), French Guyana and the Bahamas (=2), and Guatemala (n = 1). Heterogeneity of studies characteristics precluded any aggregated estimates. Histoplamosis was frequent in these cohort studies and mortality was high despite the use of HAART. Low CD4 counts, delayed HAART initiation and poor adherence were related to increased incidence, poor prognosis and increased mortality, respectively. Histoplasmosis may be an important contributor to mortality in people with HIV in Latin America. Diagnostic delays represent an important limitation for improving care of patients suspected to have histoplasmosis. Reducing histoplasmosis diagnostic delays and therapy initiation is needed to further decrease mortality.},

	abstract = {Dehorning is a common practice in cattle farming. Researchers suggest that pain during dehorning can be mitigated, although there is no conclusive evidence about the best technique and the best manner of pain relief. A systematic review-meta-analysis was performed to clarify the effect of dehorning on welfare indicators (cortisol concentration or average daily gain or vocalisation) in beef cattle up to 12 months of age. Five electronic databases were systematically searched, as well as conference proceedings and experts were contacted electronically. Pre-defined protocols were applied during all steps of the systematic review process. A random effect meta-analysis was conducted for each indicator separately with the mean of the control and treated groups. Four publications reporting seven studies and 69 trials were included in the MA involving 287 cattle. Heterogeneity between studies was observed for cortisol (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=50.5\%), average daily gain (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=70.5\%), and vocalisation (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=91.9\%). When comparing the non-dehorned group with amputation dehorning, the cortisol concentration was lower 30 min (P{\textless}0.0001) and 120 min (P=0.023) after procedure (0.767 nmol/L and 0.680 nmol/L, respectively). Local anaesthesia did not show a reduction in cortisol concentration at 30 min after dehorning by amputation. Non-dehorned animals had a tendency to decrease the number of vocalisation (P=0.081; MD=0.929) compared with the group dehorned by amputation. These results suggest that dehorning is a painful experience and that local anaesthesia did not alleviate short-term pain following dehorning. Further investigation into pain relief is required to improve confident decision making under practical conditions.},

	abstract = {Background: As growing evidence links gut microbiota with the therapeutic efficacy and side effects of anti-hyperglycemic drugs, this article aims to provide a systematic review of the reciprocal interactions between anti-hyperglycemic drugs and gut microbiota taxa, which underlie the effect of the gut microbiome on diabetic control via bug-host interactions. Method: We followed the PRISMA requirements to perform a systematic review on human vs. animal gut microbiota data in PubMed, SCOPUS, and EMBASE databases, and used Cochrane, ROBIN-I, and SYRCLE tools to assess potential bias risks. The outcomes of assessment were trends on gut microbiota taxa, diversity, and associations with metabolic control (e.g., glucose, lipid) following anti-hyperglycemic treatment. Results: Of 2,804 citations, 64 studies (17/humans; 47/mice) were included. In human studies, seven were randomized trials using metformin or acarbose in obese, pre-diabetes, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. Treatment of pre-diabetes and newly diagnosed T2D patients with metformin or acarbose was associated with decreases in genus of Bacteroides, accompanied by increases in both Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Additionally, T2D patients receiving metformin showed increases in various taxa of the order Enterobacteriales and the species Akkermansia muciniphila. Of seven studies with significant differences in beta-diversity, the incremental specific taxa were associated with the improvement of glucose and lipid profiles. In mice, the effects of metformin on A. muciniphila were similar, but an inverse association with Bacteroides was reported. Animal studies on other anti-hyperglycemic drugs, however, showed substantial variations in results. Conclusions: The changes in specific taxa and β-diversity of gut microbiota were associated with metformin and acarbose in humans while pertinent information for other anti-hyperglycemic drugs could only be obtained in rodent studies. Further human studies on anti-hyperglycemic drugs other than metformin and acarbose are needed to explore gut microbiota's role in their therapeutic efficacies and side effects.},

	abstract = {Acute benign calf myositis is a rare infection-associated syndrome presenting with calf pain that occurs in epidemics or sporadically. Epidemic cases are usually associated with influenza virus type B. Sporadic cases, however, might be associated with a large number of microorganisms. Furthermore, during an outbreak there is a great alertness that promotes earlier diagnosis. In contrast, there is likely a lower awareness regarding the sporadic form, compromising early and correct diagnosis. In order to characterize the sporadic form of acute calf myositis and increase the knowledge of this condition, we systematically reviewed the literature reporting sporadic cases. We identified 72 reports, including 451 patients, 325 males and 126 females. Sporadic acute benign calf myositis affected subjects ≤18 years of age (N = 450; 99\%), who followed a prodromal flu-like illness (N = 411; 91\%), presented with pain and tenderness affecting only the calves for ≤1½ weeks (N = 441; 99\%) and was never complicated by kidney involvement. The creatine kinase ratio was ≥10 in 310 (70\%) out of 444 cases. Microbiological studies identified an infectious trigger in 181 cases, mostly influenza virus (type B more frequently than type A), Dengue, Ebstein-Barr or Parainfluenza virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Sporadic acute benign calf myositis is a self-limited condition that can usually be diagnosed on a clinical basis. Unlike the epidemic form, many cases are due to microorganisms other than influenza virus B or A.},

	abstract = {Poultry production is an industry that generates 90,000 metric tons of chicken meat worldwide. Thus, optimizing chicken growth and sustainable production is of great importance. A central factor determining not only production parameters, but also stability of the immune system and chicken health, is the diversity and variability of the microbiota present throughout the gastrointestinal tract. To date, several studies have investigated the relationship between bacterial communities and the gut microbiome, with limited data to compare. This study aims to create a bacterial meta-analysis based on studies using amplicon sequencing with Illumina sequencing technologies in order to build a baseline for comparison in future analyses of the cecal bacterial composition in chicken. A systematic literature review was performed (SYRF ID: e84f0468-e418-4eec-9da4-b517f1b4809d). From all the available and analyzed manuscripts only nine contained full raw-sequence data available and the corresponding metadata. A total of 324 samples, comprising three different regions within the 16S rRNA gene, were analyzed. Due to the heterogeneity of the data, each region was analyzed independently and an effort for a joint analysis was performed as well. Taxonomic profiling revealed 11 phyla, with Firmicutes as the most prevalent phylum, followed by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. At genus level, 109 genera were found. Shannon metric for alpha diversity showed that factors like type of chickens (Commercial or experimental) and 16S rRNA gene subregion have negligible effect on diversity. Despite the large number of parameters that were taken into account, the identification of common bacteria showed five genera to be common for all sets in at least 50\% of the samples. These genera are highly associated to cellulose degradation and short chain fatty acids synthesis. In general, it was possible to identify some commonalities in the bacterial cecal microbial community despite the extensive variability and factors differing from one study to another.},

FTA cards® have proved useful for sample storage and latter identification of pathogens with importance for agricultural, animal and human health: however, for optimal handling, processing, and biosafety measures are not well-established. ObjectiveThis systematic review aims to summarize the reported effectiveness of FTA cards® for storage and transport of viral RNA, as well as the conditions for their handling and use in downstream processes. Finally, the biosafety measures required to protect researchers and clinical lab workers are considered. MethodsWe performed a systematic review following the PRISMA statement. We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), Scopus and Web of Science using the keywords "FTA cards" AND "RNA". Articles were screened by title and abstract, and after examination of inclusion and exclusion criteria, relevant information was extracted. The quality of the studies was assessed, and the evidence was qualitatively summarized. ResultsA total of 175 records were retrieved, and 11 additional documents were found by checking references of the eligible articles. A total of 47 articles were included. Samples from animals accounted for 38.3\% of the publications, which identified viruses that cause disease in poultry, wild birds, suids, or bovids. Three different methods for RNA extraction were reported. Other factors that vary across reports include the size of RNA amplicon, storage temperature, and duration of storage. Only fourteen articles tested the inactivation of the virus on the FTA card®, and in one case, the virus remained infective. ConclusionFTA cards® could be a suitable option for RNA virus storage and transport for fieldwork in areas where proper conditions for RNA preservation are difficult to achieve. Three different protocols have been used for RNA detection from this matrix. Biospecimens in the form of dried blood spots should be considered potentially infectious unless specifically treated to inactivate viral pathogens.},

This study aimed to assess mortality associated with blastomycosis and identify its associated risk factors. We conducted a systematic review of publications related to Blastomyces dermatitidis available in PubMed and Scopus databases. Studies that reported data on blastomycosis mortality and that were published from inception through February 2018 were assessed and included in the analysis. Using the R meta package, a random-effect model meta-analysis was used to calculate pooled and stratified estimates of case-fatality proportions and risk ratios. Of 1553 publications, we included 20 studies reporting on a total of 2820 cases of blastomycosis between 1970 and 2014 and three case series reports with 10, 21, and 36 patients. The mean or median ages ranged from 28 to 59 years. Mortality was defined as attributable mortality caused by blastomycosis in 13 studies. Among 14 studies with a standard error ≤0.05, the overall pooled mortality was 6.6\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 4.9-8.2) with 57\% heterogeneity. The mortality rate was 37\% (95\% CI, 23-51) in immunocompromised patients and 75\% (95\% CI, 53-96) in patients who developed an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (n = 3 studies each). ARDS was the only identified risk factor in general patients (risk ratio = 10.2). The overall mortality was significantly higher in studies involving immunocompromised patients and ARDS patients. Our analysis showed considerable heterogeneity among studies. Inconsistent mortality definitions may have contributed to the observed heterogeneity. Further research is needed to assess potential risk factors for mortality.},

	abstract = {Proposals to increase research reproducibility frequently call for focusing on effect sizes instead of p values, as well as for increasing the statistical power of experiments. However, it is unclear to what extent these two concepts are indeed taken into account in basic biomedical science. To study this in a real-case scenario, we performed a systematic review of effect sizes and statistical power in studies on learning of rodent fear conditioning, a widely used behavioral task to evaluate memory. Our search criteria yielded 410 experiments comparing control and treated groups in 122 articles. Interventions had a mean effect size of 29.5\%, and amnesia caused by memory-impairing interventions was nearly always partial. Mean statistical power to detect the average effect size observed in well-powered experiments with significant differences (37.2\%) was 65\%, and was lower among studies with non-significant results. Only one article reported a sample size calculation, and our estimated sample size to achieve 80\% power considering typical effect sizes and variances (15 animals per group) was reached in only 12.2\% of experiments. Actual effect sizes correlated with effect size inferences made by readers on the basis of textual descriptions of results only when findings were non-significant, and neither effect size nor power correlated with study quality indicators, number of citations or impact factor of the publishing journal. In summary, effect sizes and statistical power have a wide distribution in the rodent fear conditioning literature, but do not seem to have a large influence on how results are described or cited. Failure to take these concepts into consideration might limit attempts to improve reproducibility in this field of science.},

	abstract = {Bees are exposed to a wide range of multiple chemicals "chemical mixtures" from anthropogenic (e.g. plant protection products or veterinary products) or natural origin (e.g. mycotoxins, plant toxins). Quantifying the relative impact of multiple chemicals on bee health compared with other environmental stressors (e.g. varroa, viruses, and nutrition) has been identified as a priority to support the development of holistic risk assessment methods. Here, extensive literature searches and data collection of available laboratory studies on combined toxicity data for binary mixtures of pesticides and non-chemical stressors has been performed for honey bees (Apis mellifera), wild bees (Bombus spp.) and solitary bee species (Osmia spp.). From 957 screened publications, 14 publications provided 218 binary mixture toxicity data mostly for acute mortality (lethal dose: LD(50)) after contact exposure (61\%), with fewer studies reporting chronic oral toxicity (20\%) and acute oral LC(50) values (19\%). From the data collection, available dose response data for 92 binary mixtures were modelled using a Toxic Unit (TU) approach and the MIXTOX modelling tool to test assumptions of combined toxicity i.e. concentration addition (CA), and interactions (i.e. synergism, antagonism). The magnitude of interactions was quantified as the Model Deviation Ratio (MDR). The CA model applied to 17\% of cases while synergism and antagonism were observed for 72\% (MDR {\textgreater} 1.25) and 11\% (MDR {\textless} 0.83) respectively. Most synergistic effects (55\%) were observed as interactions between sterol-biosynthesis-inhibiting (SBI) fungicides and insecticide/acaricide. The mechanisms behind such synergistic effects of binary mixtures in bees are known to involve direct cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition, resulting in an increase in internal dose and toxicity of the binary mixture. Moreover, bees are known to have the lowest number of CYP copies and other detoxification enzymes in the insect kingdom. In the light of these findings, occurrence of these binary mixtures in relevant crops (frequency and concentrations) would need to be investigated. Addressing this exposure dimension remains critical to characterise the likelihood and plausibility of such interactions to occur under field realistic conditions. Finally, data gaps and further work for the development of risk assessment methods to assess multiple stressors in bees including chemicals and non-chemical stressors in bees are discussed.},

One potential strategy for the self-management of chronic pain is interacting with companion animals; more specifically, dogs. While studies of dog ownership suggest social, psychological, and health benefits to humans, the impact on chronic pain is unclear. The aim of this scoping review was to map the literature on dog ownership and wellbeing in people with chronic pain. This review followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) reporting guidelines. Twelve electronic databases and grey literature sources were searched for studies that included adults with chronic pain living with a dog. From 6,724 records, eight studies were included in the synthesis, including six cross-sectional survey studies and two qualitative studies. Studies specifically looking at pain provided mixed results, but people living with a dog reported better mental health. The health benefits related to social support for people living with a dog were reported as positive across several studies. Low-quality studies and variability in outcome measures limited comparisons across studies. The results of these eight studies suggest that the relationship between dog ownership and chronic pain is inconclusive and complex. Living with a dog for people who have chronic pain appears to provide positive benefits for some populations. Six studies were published after 2013 suggesting this important area of enquiry may be emerging as a new field in the study of the human- animal bond. Further research using qualitative, mixed methods, and longitudinal designs are needed to understand the potential mechanisms involved.},

This systematic review aimed to analyse and summarize the current knowledge of gene expression responses to infectious diseases in teleosts using viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites as agents through published microarray data. We conducted searches in electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science and SCOPUS until 1 May 2019. We identified 862 citations across databases and manual searches. After removing duplicates, we screened 455 unique references using titles and abstracts, of which 262 proved potentially eligible and evaluated using full text. A total of 79 articles proved eligible for this review. From the articles retrieved, we examined 261 different experiments (or 'studies') and more than a hundred thousand differentially expressed genes (DEGs). This systematic review represents the first catalogue of genes (and their associated processes) that differentially transcribe in different teleost species (13 species) due to infections generated by a large variety of pathogens (38 types). Although the obtained gene expression results are in considerable measure associated with expected immune response, other genes showed surprising significant transcriptional outcomes that may unravel unknown functions related to fish infections. This type of investigations facilitates the visualization of existing gaps in researches that may inspire future analysis in non-traditional but relevant host or pathogen species.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arthritis is a syndrome associated with exacerbated inflammation, joint destruction and chronic pain and disability. Chronic treatment of arthritis is associated with several side effects and high abandonment. Therefore, there has been an ongoing search for alternative treatments to overcome these problems. PURPOSE: Natural products, which are already widely used for their biological, cosmetic and pharmacotechnic properties, are a possible source for new drugs. Terpenes, a large class of organic compounds produced mainly by plants and trees, are a promising natural product and have already been shown to be effective in treating chronic pain, particularly of an inflammatory origin. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This review identifies the main terpenes with anti-arthritic activity reported in the last 10 years. A survey was conducted between December 2017 and June 2018 in the PUBMED, SCOPUS and Science Direct databases using combinations of the descriptors terpenes, arthritis and inflammation. RESULTS: The results showed that terpenes have promising biological effects in relation to the treatment of arthritis, with the 24 terpenes identified in our survey being effective in the modulation of inflammatory mediators important to the physiopathology of arthritis, such as IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α, NFκB, and COX-2, among others. It is important to note that most of the studies used animal models, which limits, at least in part, the direct translation to humans of the experimental evidence produced by the studies. CONCLUSION: Together, our finds suggest that terpenes can modulate the immuno-regulatory and destructive tissue events that underlie the clinical presentation and the progression of arthritis and are worthy of further clinical investigation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Unconventional perfusion flaps offer multiple potential advantages compared with traditional flaps. Although there are numerous experimental articles on unconventional perfusion flaps, the multiple animal species involved, the myriad vascular constructions used, and the frequently conflicting data reported make synthesis of this information challenging. The main aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on the experimental use of unconventional perfusion flaps, to identify the best experimental models proposed and to estimate their global survival rate. METHODS: The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all articles written in English, French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese on the experimental use of unconventional perfusion flaps and indexed to PubMed from 1981 until February 1, 2017. RESULTS: A total of 68 studies were found, corresponding to 86 optimized experimental models and 1073 unconventional perfusion flaps. The overall unconventional perfusion flap survival rate was 90.8 percent (95 percent CI, 86.9 to 93.6 percent; p {\textless} 0.001). The estimated proportion of experimental unconventional perfusion flaps presenting complete survival or nearly complete survival was 74.4 percent (95 percent CI, 62.1 to 83.7 percent; p {\textless} 0.001). The most commonly reported animal species in the literature were the rabbit (57.1 percent), the rat (26.4 percent), and the dog (14.3 percent). No significant differences were found in survival rates among these species, or among the diverse vascular patterns used. CONCLUSION: These data do not differ significantly from those reported regarding the use of unconventional perfusion flaps in human medicine, suggesting that rabbit, rat, and canine experimental unconventional perfusion flap models may adequately mimic the clinical application of unconventional perfusion flaps.},

A scoping review was undertaken with an electronic search for articles from the Ovid MEDLINE, PUBMED and EMBASE databases from 1995 to 2017. Inclusion criteria were original research articles, and reviews including both animal models and human clinical studies of acute ({\textless} 3 months) sTBI. Selected articles included both isolated sTBI and sTBI with systemic injury. After applying the inclusion criteria and removing duplicates, 141 full-text articles, 126 original research articles and 15 review articles, were evaluated in compiling this review paper. A single reviewer, CC, completed the review in two phases. During the first phase, titles and abstracts of selected articles were reviewed for inclusion. A second evaluation was then conducted on the full text of all selected articles to ensure relevancy. From our current understanding of the literature, it is unlikely a single biomarker will be sufficient in accurately prognosticating patients with sTBI. Intuitively, a more severe injury will demonstrate higher levels of inflammatory cytokines which may correlate as a marker of severe injury. This does not mean, necessarily, these cytokines have a direct and causal role in the poor outcome of the patient. Further research is required to better delineate the complex systemic inflammatory and CNS interactions that occur during sTBI before they can be applied as a reliable prognostic tool.},

Quality scoring was performed. The best evidence was synthesized from high-quality skeletally mature models, without direct trauma to tissues of interest and with multiple time points. Altogether, 2849 abstracts were reviewed. Forty-seven papers were included reporting eight different methods of inducing OA, six different species, six different methods of assessing cartilage, five different bone structural parameters, and four assessed meniscus as a potential initiator. Overall, the simultaneous onset of OA in cartilage and bone was reported in 82\% of datasets, 16\% reported bone onset, and 2\% reported cartilage onset. No dataset containing meniscal data reported meniscal onset. However, using the best evidence synthesis (n = 8), five reported simultaneous onset when OA was induced, while three reported bone onset when OA occurred spontaneously; none reported cartilage onset. In summary, there is a paucity of well-designed studies in this area which makes the conclusions drawn conjectures rather than proven certainties. However, within the limitation of data quality, this review suggests that in animal models, the structural onset of knee OA occurs either in bone prior to cartilage pathology or simultaneously.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Although numerous studies have suggested that pharmacological alteration of the dopamine (DA) system modulates reward discounting, these studies have produced inconsistent findings. OBJECTIVES: Here, we conducted a systematic review and pre-registered meta-analysis to evaluate DA drug-mediated effects on reward discounting of time, probability, and effort costs in studies of healthy rats. This produced a total of 1343 articles to screen for inclusion/exclusion. From the literature, we identified 117 effects from approximately 1549 individual rats. METHODS: Using random effects with maximum-likelihood estimation, we meta-analyzed placebo-controlled drug effects for (1) DA D1-like receptor agonists and (2) antagonists, (3) D2-like agonists and (4) antagonists, and (5) DA transporter-modulating drugs. RESULTS: Meta-analytic effects showed that DAT-modulating drugs decreased reward discounting. While D1-like and D2-like antagonists both increased discounting, agonist drugs for those receptors had no significant effect on discounting behavior. A number of these effects appear contingent on study design features like cost type, rat strain, and microinfusion location. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a nuanced relationship between DA and discounting behavior and urge caution when drawing generalizations about the effects of pharmacologically manipulating dopamine on reward-based decision-making.},

	abstract = {The effect of dairy product consumption on health has received substantial attention in the last decade. However, a number of prospective cohort studies have shown contradictory results, which causes uncertainty about the effects of dairy products on health. We conducted an overview of existing systematic reviews and meta-analyses to examine the association between dairy product consumption and all-cause mortality risk. A literature search was conducted in MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Web of Science databases from their inception to April, 2018. We evaluated the risk of bias of each study included using the AMSTAR 2 tool. The risk ratios (RRs) for each meta-analysis were displayed in a forest plot for dose-response and for high compared with low dairy consumption. The initial search retrieved 2154 articles; a total of 8 meta-analyses were finally included after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The number of included studies in each meta-analysis ranged from 6 to 26 cohort studies, which reported data from 6-28 populations. The sample sizes varied across studies from 24,466 participants reporting 5092 mortality cases to 938,817 participants reporting 126,759 mortality cases. After assessing the risk of bias, 25\% of the studies were categorized as acceptable, 25\% as good, and 50\% as very good. The RRs reported by the meta-analyses ranged from 0.96 to 1.01 per 200 g/d of dairy product consumption (including total, high-fat, low-fat, and fermented dairy products), from 0.99 to 1.01 per 200-244 g/d of milk consumption, and from 0.99 to 1.03 per 10-50 g/d of cheese consumption. The RR per 50 g/d of yogurt consumption was 0.97 (95\% CI: 0.85, 1.11). In conclusion, dairy product consumption is not associated with risk of all-cause mortality.

METHODS: A systematic review searching for the terms "(bone marrow)" AND "(aspirate OR concentrate)" AND "(cartilage OR chondral OR osteochondral)" was performed in the databases PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar regarding the use of BMAC for the treatment of focal chondral lesions of the knee. The inclusion criteria were animal and clinical studies published in English that used autologous BMAC to treat focal chondral defects of the knee. We excluded studies that evaluated nonconcentrated preparations of bone marrow aspirate or preparations that were culture expanded. RESULTS: A total of 23 studies were included: 10 studies performed in animal models and 13 human clinical studies. Animal studies showed inconsistent outcomes regarding the efficacy of BMAC for the treatment of chondral or osteochondral lesions, assessed by gross morphology, second-look arthroscopy, magnetic resonance imaging, histology, immunohistochemistry, mechanical testing, and micro-tomography. Chondral defect filling was achieved with fibrocartilage or "hyaline-like" cartilage. Cells present in BMAC did not meet the criteria to be characterized as mesenchymal stem cells according to the International Society for Cell Therapy because freshly isolated cells failed to show tri-lineage differentiation. Overall, all clinical studies, independent of the study group or level of evidence, reported improved clinical outcomes and higher macroscopic, magnetic resonance imaging, and histology scores. Comparative trials favored BMAC over microfracture and reported equivalent outcomes between BMAC and matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation. However, clinical studies were scant and showed low scientific rigor, poor methodologic quality, and low levels of evidence on average. CONCLUSIONS: Although clinical success in short-term and midterm applications has been suggested for the application of BMAC for the restoration of cartilage defects in lesions of the knee, current study designs are generally of low scientific rigor. In addition, clinical applications of this technology in animal model investigations have shown inconsistent outcomes. Thus, clinicians should apply this technology cautiously. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, systematic review of Level II, III, and IV evidence studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tylosin is a commonly used in-feed antimicrobial and is approved in several countries to reduce the incidence of liver abscesses in beef cattle. Macrolides are critically important antimicrobials in human health and used to treat some foodborne bacterial diseases, such as Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella. Feeding tylosin could select for resistant enteric bacteria in cattle, which could contaminate beef products at slaughter and potentially cause foodborne illness. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of feeding tylosin to cattle on phenotypic and genotypic resistance in several potential zoonotic enteric bacteria: Enterococcus species, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica, and Campylobacter species. This review was registered with PROSPERO (\#CRD42018085949). RESULTS: Eleven databases were searched for primary research studies that fed tylosin at approved doses to feedlot cattle and tested bacteria of interest for phenotypic or genotypic resistance. We screened 1,626 citations and identified 13 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Enterococcus species were tested in seven studies, Escherichia coli was isolated in five studies, three studies reported on Salmonella, and two studies reported on Campylobacter species. Most studies relied on phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing and seven also reported resistance gene testing. A random-effects meta-analyses of erythromycin-resistant enterococci from four studies had significant residual heterogeneity. Only two studies were available for a meta-analysis of tylosin-resistant enterococci. A semi-quantitative analysis demonstrated an increase in macrolide-resistant enterococci after long durations of tylosin administration ({\textgreater}100 days). Semi-quantitative analyses of other bacteria-antimicrobial combinations revealed mixed results, but many comparisons found no effect of tylosin administration. However, about half of these no-effect comparisons did not record the cumulative days of tylosin administration or the time since the last dose. CONCLUSIONS: When fed at approved dosages for typical durations, tylosin increases the proportion of macrolide-resistant enterococci in the cattle gastrointestinal tract, which could pose a zoonotic risk to human beef consumers. Feeding tylosin for short durations may mitigate the impact on macrolide-resistant enterococci and further studies are encouraged to determine the effect of minimizing or eliminating tylosin use in beef cattle. There may also be an impact on other bacteria and other antimicrobial resistances but additional details or data are needed to strengthen these comparisons. We encourage authors of antimicrobial-resistance studies to follow reporting guidelines and publish details of all comparisons to strengthen future meta-analyses.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Parasitic infections are considered a major public health problem due to their associated morbimortality and negative impact on physical and intellectual development, especially in the at-risk pediatric group. Periodic prophylactic administration of antiparasitic agents against soil-transmitted helminths is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) to control parasitic infections and disease burden. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in Brazil. METHODS: We performed a systematic review by searching the literature found in the PubMed, LILACS, and SciELO databases, followed by a meta-analysis of the proportions from studies published in English, Portuguese, and/or Spanish from January 2000 to May 2018. This systematic review was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42018096214). RESULTS: The prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections (protozoa and/or helminths) in Brazil was 46\% (confidence interval: 39-54\%), with 99\% heterogeneity. Prevalence varied by region: 37\%, 51\%, 50\%, 58\%, and 41\% in the Southeast, South, Northeast, North, and Central-West regions, respectively. Most studies (32/40) evaluated children ({\textless}18 years) and found an average prevalence of 51\%. Children also had the highest prevalence in all four regions: Central-West (65\%), South (65\%), North (58\%), Northeast (53\%), and Southeast (37\%). However, most studies evaluated specific populations, which may have created selection bias. Presumably, this review of intestinal parasitic diseases in Brazil includes the most studies and the largest population ever considered. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections is high in Brazil, and anthelmintic drugs should be administered periodically as a prophylactic measure, as recommended by the WHO.},

METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. Data were analyzed based on both a narrative synthesis and a meta-analysis specifically for depression. RESULTS: A total of 47 studies were selected for analysis. About 45\% focused on older adults with diseases such as dementia, and 57.4\% selected dog(s) as an intervention animal. About 34.0\% delivered interventions once a week, and the behavioral outcome domain was the most frequently investigated. The meta-analysis showed that the effect sizes of the AAT group were -1.310 (95\% CI [-1.900, -.721]).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the efficacy and safety profile of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in feline epilepsy is a crucial consideration for managing this important brain disease. However, there is a lack of information about the treatment of feline epilepsy and therefore a systematic review was constructed to assess current evidence for the AEDs' efficacy and tolerability in cats. The methods and materials of our former systematic reviews in canine epilepsy were mostly mirrored for the current systematic review in cats. Databases of PubMed, CAB Direct and Google scholar were searched to detect peer-reviewed studies reporting efficacy and/or adverse effects of AEDs in cats. The studies were assessed with regards to their quality of evidence, i.e. study design, study population, diagnostic criteria and overall risk of bias and the outcome measures reported, i.e. prevalence and 95\% confidence interval of the successful and affected population in each study and in total. RESULTS: Forty studies describing clinical outcomes of AEDs' efficacy and safety were included. Only two studies were classified as "blinded randomised controlled trials". The majority of the studies offered high overall risk of bias and described low feline populations with unclear diagnostic criteria and short treatment or follow-up periods. Individual AED assessments of efficacy and safety profile showed that phenobarbital might currently be considered as the first choice AED followed by levetiracetam and imepitoin. Only imepitoin's safety profile was supported by strong level of evidence. Imepitoin's efficacy as well as remaining AEDs' efficacy and safety profile were supported by weak level of evidence. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review reflects an evidence-based assessment of the published data on the AEDs' efficacy and safety for feline epilepsy. Currently, phenobarbital is likely to be the first-line for feline epileptic patients followed by levetiracetam and imepitoin. It is essential that clinicians evaluate both AEDs' effectiveness and tolerability before tailoring AED to the individual patient. Further studies in feline epilepsy treatment are by far crucial in order to establish definite guidelines for AEDs' efficacy and safety.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the results of controlled studies evaluating the effectiveness of animal-assisted therapy (AAT) in children. METHODS: Eleven databases were searched following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement recommendations, and references from included studies and previous reviews were examined. No date or language filters were applied. Only controlled study designs, including those using wait-list controls, that studied a specific condition or illness were included. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies that met the inclusion criteria were retrieved. Nine were conducted in children with autism spectrum disorders, 10 in cerebral palsy (CP), 2 in Down syndrome, 3 in pain, and 2 in other conditions. Qualitative synthesis showed a small but significant contribution of AAT to the management of these conditions. Meta-analysis showed a mean difference in improvement in the Gross Motor Function Measure-66 scale in children with CP of 1.61 (95\% confidence interval [CI] -2.00 to 5.23) and a mean difference for 5-point pain scales of -0.81 (95\% CI -1.32 to 0.30), both favoring AAT. CONCLUSION: Animal-assisted therapy may be useful as a complementary intervention in the management of children with CP and pain. Although results are in general positive for the management of children with Down syndrome and autism, the diversity of scales used to measure outcomes makes it difficult to establish true effectiveness. The application of simple corrective measures in the randomization process would greatly improve the quality of evidence. It is necessary to reach a consensus between AAT researchers regarding appropriate instruments to provide higher-quality evidence in further studies.},

We did a systematic review using a One Health approach to survey the key drivers of antibiotic resistance in humans. Two sets of reviewers selected 565 studies from a total of 2819 titles and abstracts identified in Embase, MEDLINE, and Scopus (2005-18), and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and WHO (One Health data). Study quality was assessed in accordance with Cochrane recommendations. Previous antibiotic exposure, underlying disease, and invasive procedures were the risk factors with most supporting evidence identified from the 88 risk factors retrieved. The odds ratios of antibiotic resistance were primarily reported to be between 2 and 4 for these risk factors when compared with their respective controls or baseline risk groups. Food-related transmission from the animal reservoir and water-related transmission from the environmental reservoir were frequently quantified. Uniformly quantifying relationships between risk factors will help researchers to better understand the process by which antibiotic resistance arises in human infections.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 2004, researchers reported that the number of nephrology clinical trials was low and that the reporting quality of such trials was suboptimal. Furthermore, the number or quality of preclinical kidney-related studies has not been systematically evaluated. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of randomized clinical trials published in 1966-2017 (listed in the Cochrane Library) and preclinical studies published in 1945-2017 (listed in PubMed). For reporting quality analysis, we evaluated the final main paper of 118 clinical trial reports and 135 preclinical studies published in leading journals in 1996, 2006, and 2016 on the basis of criteria from the widely used CONSORT and ARRIVE guidelines. RESULTS: The annual number of reports of clinical kidney-related trials more than doubled between 2004 and 2014 along with reports in other medical disciplines. Hypertension remains the dominant focus of study, but ongoing trials also center on CKD, ESRD, and AKI. The reporting quality analysis revealed improvements, but deficits in reporting of clinical trial design, mode of randomization, and intention-to-treat analysis remain. Annual numbers of kidney-related preclinical studies remained low between 1945 and 2017 compared with other disciplines. Reporting quality analysis of preclinical studies revealed substantial reporting deficits across all leading journals, with little improvement over the last 20 years, especially for group size calculations, defining primary versus secondary outcomes, and blinded analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Nephrology studies keep increasing in number but still lag behind other medical disciplines, and the quality of data reporting in kidney research can be further improved.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: We conducted a systematic review to investigate avian influenza outbreaks and to explore their distribution, upon avian influenza subtype, country, avian species and other relating details as no comprehensive epidemiological analysis of global avian influenza outbreaks from 2010 to 2016 exists. METHODS: Data was collated from four databases (Scopus, Web of Science Core Correlation, PubMed and SpringerLink electronic journal) and a global electronic reporting system (ProMED mail), using PRISMA and ORION systematic approaches. One hundred seventy three avian influenza virus outbreaks were identified and included in this review, alongside 198 ProMED mail reports. RESULTS: Our research identified that the majority of the reported outbreaks occurred in 2016 (22.2\%). These outbreaks were located in China (13.6\%) and referred to commercial poultry farms (56.1\%). The most common subtype reported in these outbreaks was H5N1 (38.2\%), while almost 82.5\% of the subtypes were highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. There were differences noticed between ProMED mail and the scientific literature screened. CONCLUSIONS: Avian influenza virus has been proved to be able to contaminate all types of avian species, including commercial poultry farms, wild birds, backyard domestic animals, live poultry, game birds and mixed poultry. The study focused on wet markets, slaughterhouses, wild habitats, zoos and natural parks, in both developed and developing countries. The impact of avian influenza virus seems disproportionate and could potentially burden the already existing disparities in the public health domain. Therefore, a collaboration between all the involved health sectors is considered to be more than necessary.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although fish consumption or omega-3 intake is associated with cardio- cerebrovascular disease including stroke, their correlation is still controversial. Therefore, this meta-analysis is to identify the relationship between the risk of stroke and fish consumption or omega-3 intake. METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN: We searched the PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases as of May 2019. Multivariateadjusted risk ratios (RRs) with 95\% confidence interval (CI) for stroke in different level intake of fish or Longchain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC ω3-PUFAs) were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. A dose-response analysis was conducted with the 2-stage generalized least-squares trend program. RESULTS: Our meta-analysis identified a total of 17 prospective cohort studies including 14986 strokes events in 672711 individuals. Meta-analysis revealed that the higher fish consumption was significantly associated with lower risk of stroke (RR=0.871, 95\% CI: 0.779-0.975, p=0.016), especially with ischemic stroke (RR=0.808, 95\% CI: 0.696- 0.937, p=0.005). Meantime, the combined RR of total stroke was 0.859 (95\% CI: 0.769-0.959, p=0.007) for the highest versus lowest intake of LC ω3-PUFAs, and stratification analysis showed that higher LC ω3-PUFAs intake was associated with reduced stroke risk in women (RR=0.793, 95\% CI: 0.706-0.891, p=0.000) but not in men. In addition, the dose-response analysis showed fish consumption with 1000g per month and LC ω3-PUFAs intake with 0.5g per month was associated with 17.3\% (RR=0.927, 95\% CI: 0.83-0.98) and 14\% (RR=0.86, 95\% CI: 0.78-0.95) lower risk of stroke, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Both fish consumption and LC ω3-PUFAs intake were negatively associated with the risk of stroke, especially in women, which suggest that increased intake of fishery products and LC ω3-PUFAs may benefit primary prevention of stroke.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease caused by severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV). The seroprevalence of anti-SFTSV antibodies specific to SFTSV (IgG or IgM) has been investigated in different animal hosts in many epidemiological studies, but no systematic estimation of seroprevalence has yet been performed. Hence, this meta-analysis was conducted in order to obtain a more comprehensive result to clarify the prevalence of SFTSV in animals. METHODS: A search for all relevant articles was conducted in the major national and international electronic databases up to August 2018. Data on seroprevalence of SFTSV antibodies (IgM and IgG) were extracted as the primary outcome. The pooled seroprevalence rates and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) were determined. RESULTS: Overall, anti-SFTSV antibodies (IgG or IgM) were detected in 15 animal species. The pooled seroprevalence of anti-SFTSV antibodies was 45.70\% in goats and sheep, 36.70\% in cattle, 29.50\% in dogs, 9.60\% in chickens, 3.20\% in rodents, and 3.20\% in pigs. The seroprevalence of SFTSV in animals that had a confined range was significantly lower than that in free-range animals. SFTSV RNA was detected in 11 animal species, with a carriage rate varying from 0.23\% to 26.31\%. CONCLUSIONS: SFTSV has a wide spectrum of animal hosts, including domestic and wild animals.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an increasing public health concern worldwide. The objective of this study was to calculate a summary odds ratio (OR) of livestock-associated MRSA colonisation and infection in humans, and to determine specific risk factors in livestock production contributing to MRSA colonisation. METHODS: We screened PubMed and Embase for studies published from 2005 to 2019 inclusive, reporting livestock-associated (LA)-MRSA colonisation and infection among livestock workers/veterinarians, their families, and community members not regularly exposed to livestock. The primary outcome of interest was the OR of LA-MRSA colonisation comparing exposed and control groups. Quality was assessed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. A meta-analysis using a random-effects model was conducted to calculate a pooled OR. The heterogeneity in the meta-analysis was assessed using the I² method, and publication bias was evaluated using funnel plots. RESULTS: A total of 3490 studies were identified by the search, with 37 studies including 53 matched exposed-control groups and 14 038 participants eligible for the meta-analysis. The pooled OR for LA-MRSA among livestock workers and veterinarians is 9.80 (95\% CI 6.89 to 13.95; p=0.000; I(2) =73.4), with no significant publication bias (Egger's p=0.66). The OR for swine workers was highest at 15.41 (95\% CI 9.24 to 25.69), followed by cattle workers (11.62, 95\% CI 4.60 to 29.36), veterinarians (7.63, 95\% CI 3.10 to 18.74), horse workers (7.45, 95\% CI 2.39 to 23.25), livestock workers (5.86, 95\% CI 1.14 to 30.16), poultry workers (5.70, 95\% CI 1.70 19.11), and industrial slaughterhouse workers (4.69, 95\% CI 1.10 to 20.0). CONCLUSIONS: Livestock workers, particularly swine farmers, are at significantly higher risk for LA-MRSA colonisation and subsequent infection. These results support the need for preventive practices to reduce LA-MRSA risk among those who handle and treat livestock. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42019120403.},

This study aimed to summarize and evaluate the effects of WBV on bone healing in ovariectomized rat models and then analyze its potential effects on fractures in human postmenopausal osteoporosis. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, SinoMed, and WanFang databases were searched from their inception date to September 2017, and an updated search was conducted in January 2018. Studies that evaluated the effects of WBV on bone healing compared with control groups in ovariectomized rats were included. Two authors selected studies, extracted data, and assessed the methodological quality. Meta-analyses were performed when the same outcomes were reported in two or more studies. RESULTS: Nine eligible studies were selected. In treatment groups, callus areas were significantly improved in the first 3 weeks, normalized total bone volume and total tissue volume values increased dramatically at 8 weeks, and the mechanical tests showed a significant difference at the end point of the study. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggested that WBV could accelerate callus formation in the early phase of bone healing, promote callus mineralization and maturity in the later phase, and restore mechanical properties of bones.},

	abstract = {Stem cell transplantation has been considered a promising therapeutic approach for premature ovarian failure (POF). However, to date, no quantitative data analysis of stem cell therapy for POF has been performed. Therefore, the present study performed a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy of stem cell transplantation in improving ovarian function in animal models of POF. In addition, a case report of a patient with POF subjected to stem cell treatment was included to demonstrate that stem cell therapy also contributes to the recovery of ovarian function in patients. Published studies were identified by a systematic review of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane's library databases, and references cited in associated reviews were also considered. Data regarding follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2), ovarian weight, follicle count, the number of pregnancies and other parameters, including delivery route and cell type, were extracted. Pooled analysis, sensitivity analyses, subgroup analyses and meta-regression were performed. In the case of POF, transvaginal ultrasound (TVS), abdominal ultrasound (TAS) and color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) were performed to observe the endometrial morphology and blood flow signals in the patient. Overall, pooled results from 16 pre-clinical studies demonstrated that stem cell-based therapy significantly improved FSH levels [standardized mean difference (SMD)=-1.330; 95\% confidence interval (CI), -(2.095-0.565); P=0.001], E2 levels (SMD=2.334; 95\% CI, 1.350-3.319; P{\textless}0.001), ovarian weight (SMD=1.310; 95\% CI, 0.157-2.463; P=0.026), follicle count (SMD=1.871; 95\% CI, 1.226-2.516; P{\textless}0.001), and the number of pregnancies (risk ratio=1.715, 95\% CI, 1.213-2.424; P=0.002). The results of TVS and TAS demonstrated improved ovarian size and endometrial thickness in the patient with POF after MSC treatment. Of note, a rich blood flow signal in the endometrium was observed on CDFI. It appeared that stem cell-based therapy may be an effective method for the resumption of ovarian function in a patient and in animal models of POF; however, large-scale and high-quality future studies are required to confirm the present findings due to heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) in wild birds pose a pandemic threat to humans and to the poultry industry. To assess AIV and AIV antibody prevalence in wild birds in China, a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Clinical Trial, VIP, CNKI, and WANFANG for published papers related to the prevalence of AIVs and their associated antibodies in wild birds in China from Mar. 10, 2005 to Sept. 20, 2018. Repeat studies, reviews, and other host studies were excluded, as well as those with inconsistent data, incomplete information, or only prevalence data or data from outside of mainland China. In total, data from 28 publications were compiled and analyzed. Based on out meta-analysis, the pooled prevalence of AIVs in wild birds in China was found to be 2.5\% (571/23,024), and the pooled prevalence of AIV antibodies was 26.5\% (1,210/4,566). The pooled prevalence of AIVs was significantly higher in wild birds from Central China (5.5\%, 271/4, 955) compared to all other regions and the pooled prevalence of AIV antibodies was significantly in wild birds from South China (56.8\%, 92/162) in comparison to all other regions. The prevalence of both AIVs and AIV antibodies in Anseriformes were higher compared to non-Anseriformes. In addition, the largest number of studies found in this review were on the HA subtypes of AIVs (H5, H7, and H9) and their associated antibodies. In summary, our findings suggest that the prevalence of AIVs and their antibodies in wild birds vary among regions and species of wild bird. Thus, further monitoring of the prevalence of AIVs and their antibodies in wild birds in China is necessary and should be used for guiding powerful and effective regulatory measures that will prevent the spread of AIVs across species.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus poses a global public health threat given severe and fatal zoonotic infections since 1997 and ongoing A(H5N1) virus circulation among poultry in several countries. A comprehensive assessment of the seroprevalence of A(H5N1) virus antibodies remains a gap and limits understanding of the true risk of A(H5N1) virus infection. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published serosurveys to assess the risk of subclinical and clinically mild A(H5N1) virus infections. We assessed A(H5N1) virus antibody titers and changes in titers among populations with variable exposures to different A(H5N1) viruses. RESULTS: Across studies using the World Health Organization-recommended seropositive definition, the point estimates of the seroprevalence of A(H5N1) virus-specific antibodies were higher in poultry-exposed populations (range 0-0.6\%) and persons exposed to both human A(H5N1) cases and infected birds (range 0.4-1.8\%) than in close contacts of A(H5N1) cases or the general population (none to very low frequencies). Seroprevalence was higher in persons exposed to A(H5N1) clade 0 virus (1.9\%, range 0.7-3.2\%) than in participants exposed to other clades of A(H5N1) virus (range 0-0.5\%) (p {\textless} 0.05). Seroprevalence was higher in poultry-exposed populations (range 0-1.9\%) if such studies utilized antigenically similar A(H5N1) virus antigens in assays to A(H5N1) viruses circulating among poultry. CONCLUSIONS: These low seroprevalences suggest that subclinical and clinically mild human A(H5N1) virus infections are uncommon. Standardized serological survey and laboratory methods are needed to fully understand the extent and risk of human A(H5N1) virus infections.},

For assessing the prevalence of BHV-1 infection in mainland China, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched English and Chinese literature databases for published paper regarding the prevalence of BHV-1 in cattle in China from inception to May 20, 2018. Search strings included if they reported the cattle samples of more than 30 cattle and provided information that allowed us to establish the prevalence of BHV-1. Moreover, we excluded repeated studies, reviews, other hosts studies, as well as studies with inconsistent data, incomplete information or only provided prevalence data, and out of mainland China data. We extracted how many cattle have BHV-1 infection from the obtained studies, moreover, and calculated pooled prevalence of BHV-1 infection in cattle. The data of 41 articles (including data on 43,441 cattle) are compliant with the standards. The pooled prevalence of BHV-1 in cattle in China was 40\%, the pooled prevalence of BHV-1 in cattle from Northeast China (24\%) was significant lower than those from other regions. In addition, the prevalence of BHV-1 was associated with publication time of paper, detection methods, age of cattle, and clinical symptoms (pneumonia, abortion etc.).Our findings suggest that BHV-1 is common in cattle in mainland China. It is necessary to monitor the prevalence of BHV-1 in cattle and the powerful and effective regulatory measures should be taken out to prevent the spread of BHV-1.},

It is an acute and highly contagious enteric disease in swine characterized by watery diarrhea and vomiting. Here, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis in order to assess the prevalence of PEDV infection in pig populations from mainland China. METHODS: We conducted a literature search on the prevalence of PEDV infection in pigs between Jan 1, 1988 and Aug 20, 2018 in English and Chinese databases, including PubMed, Google scholar, Cochrane library, Clinical Trials, VIP, CNKI and WanFang database. Selections were made based on the title and the abstract of paper, and duplicated literature was excluded along with other host studies, and data incomplete literature according to the exclusion criteria we formulated. Finally, we extracted the number of swine with PEDV infection from the obtained studies and provided information that permitted us to estimate the prevalence of PEDV infection in pigs in mainland China. RESULTS: A total of 45 studies (including data from 15,990 pigs) met our evaluation criteria. In China, the overall estimated prevalence of PEDV infection in pigs was 44\% (7113/15,990), while the estimated prevalence of PEDV infection in pigs from northern China was 37\% (793/2136), lower than those in other regions of China. The prevalence of PEDV infection was associated with sampling season, category of pigs and clinical signs (diarrhea) in pigs. However, the prevalence of PEDV among pigs in China was not significantly associated with the effect of detected target genes, nor was it associated with date of study publication. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that PEDV infection is common among pigs in China. It is therefore necessary to carry out further research and monitor the prevalence of PEDV infection. Furthermore, powerful and effective regulatory measures should be taken in order to prevent the transmission and spread of PEDV among pig populations.},

METHODS: The relevant animal experiments of EA treatment for hyperlipidemia combined with atherosclerosis were retrieved from the CNKI, WANFANG, VIP, CBM, PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library up to March 19, 2018 since the establishment of databases. Two researchers in the project team screened the literature and extracted the information such as experiment objects, experiment steps and experiment results separately. The literature assessment was evaluated. Meta analysis was performed with RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: Eventually, 29 eligible experimental researches were included and the average score in the quality assessment was 5.1, at the moderate level. Meta analysis showed that compared with the model control group, after EA treatment, the levels of the total cholesterol (TC) [SMD -2.29, 95\% CI (-2.94, -1.64), P{\textless}0.000 01], triglyceride (TG) [SMD -1.30, 95\% CI (-1.76, -0.84), P{\textless}0.000 01] and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) [SMD -2.64, 95\% CI (-3.29, -1.99), P{\textless}0.000 01] were significantly reduced and the level of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) [SMD 0.55, 95\% CI (0.06, 1.04), P =0.03] was increased, indicating the significant differences. CONCLUSION: On the base of the current limited evidences, EA significantly reduces the levels of TC, TG and LDL-C and slightly increases the level of HDL-C in the animal models of hyperlipidemia combined with atherosclerosis.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a zoonotic pathogen that has spread worldwide. The HEV reservoir associated with livestock hepatitis E poses a huge threat to public health. Awareness of the prevalence and spatial distribution of livestock hepatitis E is valuable to prevent and control diseases caused by HEV, especially human hepatitis E infection. Currently, swine, including pigs (Sus scrofa), are recognized as the major reservoir of HEV. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the pooled prevalence of HEV among swine in China. A total of 71 published papers on HEV infection in swine in China (including data from 49,523 animals) from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2019 met the standard after searching five databases including the Technology Periodical Database, the Wan Fang Database, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, PubMed, and ScienceDirect. A random effects model was used to calculate the pooled prevalence of HEV in swine. The results showed that the seroprevalence was 48.0\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 39.6-56.9) and the prevalence of HEV RNA was 14.4\% (95\% CI 10.7-18.5). The estimated overall prevalence was 34.1\% (95\% CI 27.2-41.4). Central China (68.0\%, 95\% CI 42.2-89.1) had a significantly higher prevalence than other regions. In the publication year subgroup, the prevalence in 2016 or later (27.2\%, 95\% CI 19.3-36.0) was significantly lower than that in 2011 or earlier (49.0\%, 95\% CI 36.2-61.8). The prevalence of IgG (42.9\%, 95\% CI 31.7-54.6) was significantly higher than that of IgM (4.9\%, 95\% CI 1.6-9.7). Suckling piglets (15.6\%, 95\% CI 6.6-27.1) had a lower prevalence compared with that in other age groups. In all sample types, body fluids showed the highest prevalence (50.5\%, 95\% CI 41.7-59.3). Moreover, the pooled prevalence of HEV in boars was higher than that in sows (35.4\% {\textgreater} 17.3\%). The analysis suggested that HEV infection is common among swine in China. Further strengthening HEV testing in boars, controlling environmental pollution, and reducing the mixed feeding of different stages could contribute to reducing HEV infection in pigs in China and the risk of porcine HEV infection in humans.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Photosensitisation is a clinical condition occurring in both humans and animals that causes significant injury to affected individuals. In livestock, outbreaks of photosensitisation caused by ingestion of toxic plants are relatively common and can be associated with significant economic loss. OBJECTIVES: The agents that are most commonly implicated in outbreaks of photosensitisation have not been formally investigated on a global scale. To address this question, a systematic review of the literature was undertaken to determine the most common causative agents implicated in outbreaks of photosensitisation in livestock in Australia and globally, as well as the prevalence and morbidity of such outbreaks. METHODS: A systematic database search was conducted to identify peer-reviewed case reports of photosensitisation in livestock published worldwide between 1900 and April 2018. Only case reports with a full abstract in English were included. Non peer-reviewed reports from Australia were also investigated. Case reports were then sorted by plant and animal species, type of photosensitisation by diagnosis, location, morbidity and mortality rate and tabulated for further analysis. RESULTS: One hundred and sixty-six reports qualified for inclusion in this study. Outbreaks were reported in 20 countries. Australia (20), Brazil (20) and the United States (11) showed the highest number of peer-reviewed photosensitisation case reports from this analysis. Hepatogenous (Type III) photosensitisation was the most frequently reported diagnosis (68.5\%) and resulted in higher morbidity. Panicum spp., Brachiaria spp. and Tribulus terrestris were identified as the most common causes of hepatogenous photosensitisation globally. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatogenous photosensitisation in livestock represents a significant risk to livestock production, particularly in Australia, Brazil, and the United States. Management of toxic pastures and common pasture weeds may reduce the economic impact of photosensitisation both at a national and global level.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Peripheral blood (PB) is a potential source of chondrogenic progenitor cells that can be used for cartilage repair and regeneration. However, the cell types, isolation and implantation methods, seeding dosage, ultimate therapeutic effect, and in vivo safety remain unclear. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and the Web of Science databases were systematically searched for relevant reports published from January 1990 to December 2019. Original articles that used PB as a source of stem cells to repair cartilage in vivo were selected for analysis. RESULTS: A total of 18 studies were included. Eight human studies used autologous nonculture-expanded PB-derived stem cells (PBSCs) as seed cells with the blood cell separation isolation method, and 10 animal studies used autologous, allogenic or xenogeneic culture-expanded PB-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PB-MSCs), or nonculture-expanded PBSCs as seed cells. Four human and three animal studies surgically implanted cells, while the remaining studies implanted cells by single or repeated intra-articular injections. 121 of 130 patients (in 8 human clinical studies), and 230 of 278 animals (in 6 veterinary clinical studies) using PBSCs for cartilage repair achieved significant clinical improvement. All reviewed articles indicated that using PB as a source of seed cells enhances cartilage repair in vivo without serious adverse events. CONCLUSION: Autologous nonculture-expanded PBSCs are currently the most commonly used cells among all stem cell types derived from PB. Allogeneic, autologous, and xenogeneic PB-MSCs are more widely used in animal studies and are potential seed cell types for future applications. Improving the mobilization and purification technology, and shortening the culture cycle of culture-expanded PB-MSCs will obviously promote the researchers' interest. The use of PBSCs for cartilage repair and regeneration in vivo are safe. PBSCs considerably warrant further investigations due to their superiority and safety in clinical settings and positive effects despite limited evidence in humans.},

	doi = {10.1039/d0fo00537a},
	abstract = {Dragon fruit (Hylocereus) and cactus pear (Opuntia) are cacti species that have been widely used globally as a reliable source of food as well as traditional folk remedies. They have become of scientific interest recently due to their high levels of bioactive phytochemical compounds, in particular betalains. Earlier systematic reviews have explored the impact of supplementation of these cactus species on obesity, type-2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular risk factors: body weight and composition, serum triglycerides, cholesterol, blood glucose and blood pressure. However, effects on vascular health and endothelial function have yet to be reviewed. In order to address this gap in the literature, a systematic review has been conducted to evaluate the physiological effects of Hylocereus and Opuntia cacti on endothelial and vascular function in in vivo animal models and human studies. An electronic search was performed in the following databases: PubMed (MEDLINE), EMBASE (via Ovid), CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science®, and The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL). All journals were searched since inceptions up to January 2020 without language restriction. Outcomes of interest were blood pressure, arterial stiffness, vascular reactivity and biochemical markers of endothelial dysfunction. Two investigators independently performed the study selection and data extraction. From 394 references, only 16 studies (9 animal and 7 human) fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Animal studies suggested a potential increase in vasodilation and serum nitric oxide and a reduction in vascular stiffness and blood pressure. The small number of human studies showed a reduction in heart rate as well as an increase in heart rate variability. Although these findings appear to indicate improvement in vascular health, there is a severe lack of robust, randomised human intervention studies to identify underlying mechanisms, optimal dose and long-term effects of cacti consumption.},

The aim of this review was to estimate the status of urinary schistosomiasis in the State with regards to the elimination goals of World Health Organization (WHO). A comprehensive search of published articles on urinary schistosomiasis in Ebonyi State, Nigeria from 2006 to 2017 was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed and African Journals Online (AJOL) databases. Out of 26 retrieved articles, 15 met the inclusion criteria. The MetaXL software was used to compute the pooled prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis using the random effect model and results are presented as forest plot. Based on meta-analysis output, the pooled prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis was 26.02\% [95\% Confidence Interval (CI) = 17.91-35.04\%]. The pooled prevalence was higher before 2014, the year when treatment with praziquantel (PZQ) was started. Of the senatorial zones, Ebonyi North had the highest pooled prevalence of 34.57\% (95\% CI = 10.50-61.32\%). In addition, the prevalence of the disease was higher when all the age groups were sampled (31.33\%; 95\% CI = 12.75-51.98\%) than when only schoolchildren were used as sampling population (25.23\%; 95\% CI = 15.66-35.93\%). The pooled prevalence revealed that despite the mass drug distribution (MDA) of PZQ in the State, there is continued transmission of urinary schistosomiasis. Hence, if the WHO elimination goal of the disease has to be met, focused control and elimination programmes along with intense complementary public-health interventions are necessary.},

Dogs, therefore, pose a public health risk and a good understanding of canine diseases is important for planning and implementing control measures. The aim of this study was to characterise canine helminthiasis in sub-Saharan Africa using a systematic approach. METHODS: Pubmed and Google Scholar were searched for relevant primary studies published from 2000. Forty-one eligible studies were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled prevalences were estimated using the quality effects model. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Twenty-six genera of enteric helminths were reported and the pooled estimate of canine helminthiasis was 71\% (95\% CI: 63-79\%). Species of Ancylostoma and Toxocara, causative agents of larva migrans in humans, were the most frequently reported helminths with pooled estimated prevalences of 41\% (95\% CI: 32-50\%) and 22\% (95\% CI: 16-29\%), respectively. Dipylidium caninum and Taenia spp. were the most frequently reported cestodes with pooled estimated prevalences of 20\% (95\% CI: 12-29\%) and 9\% (95\% CI: 5-15\%), respectively. Trematodes were rarely reported. There was a high level of heterogeneity in most pooled estimates (I(2) ˃ 80\%). The results of this study show that canine helminthiasis is highly prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa and there is need for regular deworming programmes to improve the health status of the dogs and minimise the potential health risk to humans.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tendinopathy is a common musculoskeletal condition affecting subjects regardless of their activity level. Multiple inflammatory molecules found in ex vivo samples of human tendons are related to the initiation or progression of tendinopathy. Their role in tendon healing is the subject of this review. SOURCES OF DATA: An extensive review of current literature was conducted using PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library using the term 'tendon', as well as some common terms of tendon conditions such as 'tendon injury OR (tendon damage) OR tendonitis OR tendinopathy OR (chronic tendonitis) OR tendinosis OR (chronic tendinopathy) OR enthesitis' AND 'healing' AND '(inflammation OR immune response)' as either key words or MeSH terms. AREAS OF AGREEMENT: An environment characterized by a low level of chronic inflammation, together with increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, may influence the physiological tendon healing response after treatment. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY: Most studies on this topic exhibited limited scientific translational value because of their heterogeneity. The evidence associated with preclinical studies is limited. GROWING POINTS: The role of inflammation in tendon healing is still unclear, though it seems to affect the overall outcome. A thorough understanding of the biochemical mediators of healing and their pathway of pain could be used to target tendinopathy and possibly guide its management. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH: We require further studies with improved designs to effectively evaluate the pathogenesis and progression of tendinopathy to identify cellular and molecular targets to improve outcomes.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.jep.2020.112907},
	abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alopecia is a chronic condition that may cause emotional and psychological distress to patients, which may significantly impact a patient's quality of life. As conventional treatments have only a transient therapeutic effect and result in unwanted side effects, many patients have attempted to find therapeutic herbs or compounds that function as safer and more potent treatments for alopecia. Many such herbs have been used in complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) for centuries; however, there is a lack of information on the therapeutic mechanisms of herbs used for the treatment of alopecia. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this review was to perform a critical assessment of the methods and results of experimental studies related to alopecia and to provide the potential mechanisms of action of herbs and their constituent compounds used in the identified studies, in particular, in relation to the stages of the cell cycle. We hope to better guide the clinical application and scientific research of herbs for the treatment of alopecia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed experimental studies to determine the methods used and the mechanism of action of the herbs and constituent compounds. Databases, including Medline (via PubMed), EMBASE, OASIS, and RISS, were searched for the following keywords: "medicinal plants," "alopecia," "alopecia areata," "androgenetic alopecia," "animal experiment," and "in vitro study." We also assessed the risks of bias, toxicity, and taxonomy to determine the quality of information. RESULTS: C57BL/6 mice and human dermal papilla cells were the most commonly used models for in vivo and in vitro studies, respectively. Many herbs and their constituent compounds were used to treat alopecia by managing the hair cycle, keratinocyte proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, hormones, and inflammation. These compounds prolong the anagen phase, shorten the transition from the telogen to phase anagen, and inhibit premature catagen phase. CONCLUSIONS: This review has further elucidated the therapeutic mechanisms of herbs and their constituent compounds that are relevant to alopecia and discussed the effectiveness of using herbal treatments. There is a need to develop evidence regarding the quality control, taxonomy, and toxicology of these compounds. Such improvements will provide a better quality of evidence to ensure the efficacy and safety of herbs and compounds used for the treatment of alopecia.},

For comparison, a systematic review was also performed by searching PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science using the keywords 'rabies,' 'bat' and 'exposure.' There were three MBE events in Rhode Island between 2010 and 2016 in which groups of individuals were asleep during the potential exposure. As a result, RIDOH provided PEP to those involved in the event. In a systematic review of 12 published reports, a variety of settings were involved in MBEs: camping sites, a domestic flight, a neonatal intensive care unit and dormitories. The number of potential rabies exposures ranged from five to 1,429 people. PEP recommendations for assessed persons ranged from 0\% to 100\% across events (median 21\%). The variation in PEP recommendations following a MBE may be dependent on medical need, past precedent or preference.

Advances in regenerative medicine have now led to animal studies examining the possibility of restoring injured hair cells with mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) administration. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to collate the existing preclinical literature evaluating MSCs as a treatment for SNHL and quantify the effect of MSCs on functional hearing. Our protocol was published online on CAMARADES. Searches were conducted in four medical databases by two independent investigators. Twelve studies met inclusion and were evaluated for risk of bias using SYRCLE. Rodent models were commonly used (n = 8, 66\%), while auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE) were the most frequent measures assessing hearing loss. MSCs were derived from multiple tissue sources, including bone marrow, adipose tissue, and umbilical cord blood and the dose ranged from 4 × 10(3) to 1 × 10(7) cells. Treatment with MSCs resulted in an improvement in ABR and DPOAE (mean difference-15.22, + 9.10, respectively). Despite high heterogeneity and multiple "unclear" domains in the risk of bias, this review provides evidence that MSCs may have a beneficial effect in hearing function.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neurotrophins of the nerve growth factor family are soluble polypeptides that are best known for their role in nerve growth, survival and differentiation in the central nervous system. A growing body of literature shows that neurotrophins and their receptors are also expressed throughout the reproductive tract. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: Neurotrophins are key regulatory proteins in reproductive physiology during development and throughout adult life. Of the neurotrophins, the literature describing the expression and function of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its high-affinity receptor, neurotrophin receptor kinase-2 (NTRK2), has been expanding rapidly. We therefore conducted a systematic inductive qualitative review of the literature to better define the role of the BDNF in the reproductive tract. We postulate that BDNF and NTRK2 are central regulatory proteins throughout the reproductive system. SEARCH METHODS: An electronic search of Medline (PubMed) and Web of Science for articles relating to BDNF and the reproductive system was carried out between January 2018 and February 2019. OUTCOMES: In the ovary, BDNF expression and levels have been linked with follicle organisation during ovarian development, follicle recruitment and growth and oocyte maturation. In the endometrium, BDNF is involved in cell proliferation and neurogenesis. In contrast, literature describing the role of BDNF in other reproductive tissues is sparse and BDNF-NTRK2 signalling in the male reproductive tract has been largely overlooked. Whilst estradiol appears to be the primary regulator of BDNF expression, we also identified reports describing binding sites for glucocorticoid and myocyte enhancer factor-2, a calcium-response element through activation of an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear transporter protein-4 (ARNT) response elements in promoter regions of the BDNF gene. Expression is also regulated by multiple microRNAs and post-translational processing of precursor proteins and intracellular shuttling. BDNF-NTRK2 signalling is modulated through tissue specific receptor expression of either the full-length or truncated NTRK2 receptor; however, the functional importance remains to be elucidated. Dysregulation of BDNF expression and circulating concentrations have been implicated in several reproductive disorders including premature ovarian failure, endometriosis, pre-eclampsia, intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) and several reproductive cancers. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: We conclude that BDNF and its receptors are key regulatory proteins central to gonadal development, ovarian regulation and uterine physiology, as well as embryo and placenta development. Furthermore, dysregulation of BDNF-NTRK2 in reproductive diseases suggests their potential role as candidate clinical markers of disease and potential therapeutic targets.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maternal nutrition during pregnancy has life-long consequences for offspring. However, the effects of maternal overnutrition and/ or obesity on fetal growth remain poorly understood, e.g., it is not clear why birthweight is increased in some obese pregnancies but not in others. Maternal obesity is frequently studied using rodents on high-fat diets, but effects on fetal growth are inconsistent. The purpose of this review is to identify factors that contribute to reduced or increased fetal growth in rodent models of maternal overnutrition. METHODS: We searched Web of Science and screened 2173 abstracts and 328 full texts for studies that fed mice or rats diets providing {\textasciitilde} 45\% or {\textasciitilde} 60\% calories from fat for 3 weeks or more prior to pregnancy. We identified 36 papers matching the search criteria that reported birthweight or fetal weight. RESULTS: Studies that fed 45\% fat diets to mice or 60\% fat diets to rats generally did not show effects on fetal growth. Feeding a 45\% fat diet to rats generally reduced birth and fetal weight. Feeding mice a 60\% fat diet for 4-9 weeks prior to pregnancy tended to increase in fetal growth, whereas feeding this diet for a longer period tended to reduce fetal growth. CONCLUSIONS: The high-fat diets used most often with rodents do not closely match Western diets and frequently reduce fetal growth, which is not a typical feature of obese human pregnancies. Adoption of standard protocols that more accurately mimic effects on fetal growth observed in obese human pregnancies will improve translational impact in this field.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Males and females may experience different effects of early-life adversity on life-long health. One hypothesis is that male foetuses invest more in foetal growth and relatively less in placental growth, and that this makes them susceptible to poor nutrition in utero, particularly if nutrition is reduced part-way through gestation. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to examine whether (1) food and/ or protein restriction in rats and mice has consistent sex-dependent effects, (2) sex-dependency differs between types of outcomes, and (3) males are more severely affected when restriction starts part-way through gestation. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Web of Science were searched to identify eligible studies. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Eligible studies described controlled experiments that restricted protein or food during gestation in rats or mice, examined physiological traits in offspring from manipulated pregnancies, and tested whether effects differed between males and females. RESULTS: Our search identified 292 articles, of which the full texts of 72 were assessed, and 65 were included for further synthesis. A majority (50) used Wistar or Sprague-Dawley rats and so these were the primary focus. Among studies in which maternal diet was restricted for the duration of gestation, no type of trait was consistently more severely affected in one particular sex, although blood pressure was generally increased in both sexes. Meta-analysis found no difference between sexes in the effect of protein restriction throughout gestation on blood pressure. Among studies restricting food in the latter half of gestation only, there were again few consistent sex-dependent effects, although three studies found blood pressure was increased in males only. Meta-analysis found that food restriction in the second half of gestation increased adult blood pressure in both sexes, with a significantly greater effect in males. Birthweight was consistently reduced in both sexes, a result confirmed by meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: We found little support for the hypotheses that males are more affected by food and protein restriction, or that effects are particularly severe if nutrition is reduced part-way through gestation. However, less than half of the studies tested for sex by maternal diet interactions to identify sex-dependent effects. As a result, many reported sex-specific effects may be false positives.},

It is an herbaceous shrub that is popular in many different traditional and complementary medicinal systems. Its popularity has been justified by the plethora of studies that have shown that the secondary metabolites of the plant has effects that range from anti-inflammatory and gastroprotective to anorexic and antihypertensive. As such, OS could also be a potential treatment for Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders. However, a cohesive synthesis of the protective actions of OS was lacking. This systematic review was therefore commenced to elaborate on the various protective mechanisms of OS in the CNS. The PRISMA model was used and five databases (Google Scholar, SCOPUS, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, and PubMed) were searched with relevant keywords to finally identify four articles that met the inclusion criteria. The articles described the protective effects of OS extracts on Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, learning and memory, oxidative stress, and neurotoxicity. All the articles found were experimental or preclinical studies on animal models or in vitro systems. The reported activities demonstrated that OS could be a potential neuroprotective agent and might improve CNS conditions like neurodegeneration, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress.},

Contaminated ready-to-eat foods are common sources of L. monocytogenes, yet no global estimates exist for prevalence and levels in high-risk ready-to-eat foods. Our objective was to estimate the prevalence and levels of L. monocytogenes in deli meat, soft cheese, and packaged salad. We searched Medline, Web of Science, Agricola, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, Science.gov, ScienceResearch.com, and OpenGREY for studies on L. monocytogenes prevalence and/or levels, with no restriction on publication date. We used a priori study selection, data extraction, and risk of biases processes. Results were synthesized with random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regressions to evaluate heterogeneity between studies. We included in the review 100 studies with a sample size restriction of 100, and we estimated L. monocytogenes prevalence in deli meat at 2.9\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 2.3 to 3.6\%), in soft cheese at 2.4\% (95\% CI, 1.6 to 3.6\%), and in packaged salad at 2.0\% (95\% CI, 1.2 to 3.1\%). High heterogeneity was present in all food groups, and meta-regressions did not reveal consistent explanations for heterogeneity. Pathogen level was not reported consistently or in the format required for synthesis, so meta-analyses of this variable were not performed. The high heterogeneity between studies indicates that use of global summary prevalence estimates for risk assessments are not advisable, but awareness of risk and the heterogeneity of the risk is relevant for education and further risk assessment.},

There is a widespread belief that nonhuman primates evince only a weak capacity to use deictic cues; in contrast, domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) tend to demonstrate high success rates. This pattern of canid superiority has been taken to support the Domestication Hypothesis, which posits enhancing effects of artificial selection on the sociocognitive abilities of dogs and humans. Here we review nearly two decades of published findings, using variants of the OCT. We find systematic confounds with species classification in task-relevant preparation of the subjects, in the imposition of a barrier between reward and subject, and in the specific deictic cues used to indicate the location of hidden objects. Thus, the widespread belief that dogs outperform primates on OCTs is undermined by the systematic procedural differences in the assessments of these skills, differences that are confounded with taxonomic classification.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic arbovirus that causes severe disease in livestock and humans. The virus has caused recurrent outbreaks in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula since its discovery in 1931. This review sought to evaluate RVFV seroprevalence across the African continent in livestock, wildlife and humans in order to understand the spatio-temporal distribution of RVFV seroprevalence and to identify knowledge gaps and areas requiring further research. Risk factors associated with seropositivity were identified and study designs evaluated to understand the validity of their results. METHODOLOGY: The Preferred Reporting of Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to produce a protocol to systematically search for RVFV seroprevalence studies in PubMed and Web of Science databases. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement guided the evaluation of study design and analyses. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 174 RVFV seroprevalence studies in 126 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. RVFV seroprevalence was recorded in 31 African countries from 1968 to 2016 and varied by time, species and country. RVFV seroprevalence articles including either livestock and humans or livestock and wildlife seroprevalence records were limited in number (8/126). No articles considered wildlife, livestock and human seroprevalence concurrently, nor wildlife and humans alone. Many studies did not account for study design bias or the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests. CONCLUSIONS: Future research should focus on conducting seroprevalence studies at the wildlife, livestock and human interface to better understand the nature of cross-species transmission of RVFV. Reporting should be more transparent and biases accounted for in future seroprevalence research to understand the true burden of disease on the African continent.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by Coxiella burnetii. This bacterium survives harsh conditions and attaches to dust, suggesting environmental dispersal is a risk factor for outbreaks. Spatial epidemiology studies collating evidence on Q fever geographical contamination gradients are needed, as human cases without occupational exposure are increasing worldwide. METHODS: We used a systematic literature search to assess the role of distance from ruminant holdings as a risk factor for human Q fever outbreaks. We also collated evidence for other putative drivers of C. burnetii geographical dispersal. RESULTS: In all documented outbreaks, infective sheep or goats, not cattle, was the likely source. Evidence suggests a prominent role of airborne dispersal; Coxiella burnetii travels up to 18 km on gale force winds. In rural areas, highest infection risk occurs within 5 km of sources. Urban outbreaks generally occur over smaller distances, though evidence on attack rate gradients is limited. Wind speed / direction, spreading of animal products, and stocking density may all contribute to C. burnetii environmental gradients. CONCLUSIONS: Q fever environmental gradients depend on urbanization level, ruminant species, stocking density and wind speed. While more research is needed, evidence suggests that residential exclusion zones around holdings may be inadequate to contain this zoonotic disease, and should be species-specific.},

	volume = {14},
	issn = {1932-6203},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0220524},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Most research into the health benefits of human-animal interaction has focused on species that interact physically with humans, such as dogs. This may be unsuitable for certain populations for reasons including accessibility and the risk of negative consequences to both the person and the animal. However, some research has associated viewing fish in aquariums with positive well-being outcomes; as there is no physical contact with the animal, this form of interaction carries less risk. At present, little is known about the specific benefits of human-fish interaction. OBJECTIVES: To explore current evidence relating to the psychological and physiological benefits of interacting with fish in aquariums. METHODS: Systematic searches were conducted to identify relevant primary research of any design. All forms of interaction were considered, including keeping fish as companion animals and fish aquarium-based interventions. "Non-live" alternatives, such as videos, were also considered. This review was conducted according to a registered protocol (PROSPERO ID: CRD42018090466). RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included. Two provided tentative evidence that keeping home aquaria is associated with relaxation. The remaining studies involved novel interactions with fish in home or public aquariums. Outcomes relating to anxiety, relaxation and/or physiological stress were commonly assessed; evidence was mixed with both positive and null findings. Preliminary support was found for effects on mood, pain, nutritional intake and body weight, but not loneliness. All studies had methodological issues and risk of bias was either high or unclear. CONCLUSIONS: Review findings suggest that interacting with fish in aquariums has the potential to benefit human well-being, although research on this topic is currently limited. Future research should aim to address gaps in the evidence, such as whether and how the type of human-fish interaction can influence well-being outcomes. Researchers should also aim to address the methodological concerns highlighted in this review.},

	abstract = {Daily rumination time (RT; min/d) is recognized as an important tool for assessing the health of dairy cows, which may depend on the disease, lactation stage and individual cows. Using a systematic review-meta-analysis, this study evaluated whether the variation in RT is effective for early detection of metritis and subclinical ketosis (SCK) in dairy cows in the pre and post-partum periods (from three weeks before to three weeks after calving). The research was carried out in four electronic databases - Scopus, Science Direct, Pubmed and Web of Science. The main inclusion criteria were original research; evaluation of RT in dairy cows; and use of RT for early identification of metritis and/or SCK in post-partum dairy cows. A random effect meta-analysis (MA) was conducted for each disease (metritis and SCK) separately, with the RT means of healthy and sick groups, measured in the pre and post-partum. The effect size used was the mean difference (MD).Twenty-two trials from six studies were included in the MA, involving 1494 dairy cows. For metritis, four trials from three studies in the pre-partum period were considered as well as five trials from four studies in the post-partum. For SCK, six trials from four studies pre-partum and seven trials from five studies in the post-partum period were taken into consideration. The heterogeneity between studies for metritis was null (I(2) = 0\%) and low (I(2) = 5.7 \%) in the pre-partum and in the post-partum, respectively. The MD of RT between healthy cows and those with metritis was different in the pre (MD =0.411 min/d; P {\textless} 0.001) and in the post-partum (MD =0.279 min/d; P {\textless} 0.001). In SCK, heterogeneity was high in the pre (I(2) = 69 \%) and in the post-partum (I(2) = 58.1 \%), and the MD of RT was similar between healthy and sick cows (P{\textgreater} 0.05). In a meta-regression, RT from primiparous cows showed a lower predicted value for MD (0.48 min. d; P {\textless} 0.05) compared to multiparous cows, and the increment in each unit of milk production decreased the predicted MD value by 0.08 min. d (P {\textless} 0.001). Our MA demonstrates that RT is a good predictor for early detection of metritis in pre and post-partum; however, it is not an adequate predictor for SCK. Further investigations using more frequent blood sampling and the same threshold values for BHB are required to assess the adequacy of rumination time to predict SCK.},

	abstract = {BackgroundCampylobacter is a leading global cause of bacterial gastroenteritis, motivating research to identify sources of human infection. Population genetic studies have been increasingly applied to this end, mainly using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) data.ObjectivesThis review aimed to summarise approaches and findings of these studies and identify best practice lessons for this form of genomic epidemiology.MethodsWe systematically reviewed publications using MLST data to attribute human disease isolates to source. Publications were from January 2001, when this type of approach began. Searched databases included Scopus, Web of Science and PubMed. Information on samples and isolate datasets used, as well as MLST schemes and attribution algorithms employed, was obtained. Main findings were extracted, as well as any results' validation with subsequent correction for identified biases. Meta-analysis is not reported given high levels of heterogeneity.ResultsOf 2,109 studies retrieved worldwide, 25 were included, and poultry, specifically chickens, were identified as principal source of human infection. Ruminants (cattle or sheep) were consistently implicated in a substantial proportion of cases. Data sampling and analytical approaches varied, with five different attribution algorithms used. Validation such as self-attribution of isolates from known sources was reported in five publications. No publication reported adjustment for biases identified by validation.ConclusionsCommon gaps in validation and adjustment highlight opportunities to generate improved estimates in future genomic attribution studies. The consistency of chicken as the main source of human infection, across high income countries, and despite methodological variations, highlights the public health importance of this source.},

	abstract = {Background and objectives: Chronic pain is a complex global public health problem that affects the health status, quality of life, activities of daily living, and different work-related variables. Riding a horse may lead to some benefits in chronic pain patients through the improvement of postural control and other biopsychosocial processes. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effects of horse riding (with real or simulated horses) on chronic pain. Materials and methods: A systematic literature search was carried out in accordance with PRISMA guidelines in Web of Science (WOS) and PubMed (Medline) electronic databases. Eleven articles (seven randomized controlled trials) were selected to be included in the review. Due to some risk of bias concerns, two meta-analyses (using postintervention or change-from-baseline measures) were conducted utilizing Review Manager Software (RevMan 5.3). Results: Horse-riding simulators significantly reduced the pain levels of patients with low back pain (p = 0.03, with a SMD of -1.14 and a 95\% CI from -2.16 to -0.11) using change-from-baseline measures. However, the p-value in the meta-analysis with the postintervention measures was 0.06. Regarding interventions with real horses, it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis due to the low number of studies. Conclusion: Horse riding could be a useful exercise to reduce pain, but more studies are needed to make evidence-based recommendations and to compare the effects of horse-riding with real and simulated horses.},

	abstract = {Current recommendations for the elimination of canine-mediated human rabies focus on mass dog vaccination as the most feasible and cost-effective strategy. However, attempts to control rabies are often combined with canine surgical sterilisation programmes. The added value of sterilisation is widely debated. A systematic review was undertaken to compare the outcomes and impact of vaccination and sterilisation programmes with vaccination only programmes. A systematic search of three electronic databases (CAB Abstracts, Medline and Global Health) and grey literature was performed. From 8696 abstracts found, 5554 unique studies were identified, and 16 studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight described vaccination only programmes and eight described vaccination and sterilisation programmes. Indicators of impact measured were dog bites and/or doses of post-exposure prophylaxis administered; numbers of dog and/or human rabies cases; dog population demographic changes; changes in health and welfare of dogs, and indicators related to human behaviour change. The studies were contextually very diverse, programmes being implemented were complex, and there was variation in measurement and reporting of key indicators. Therefore, it was difficult to compare the two types of intervention, and impossible to make an evaluation of the role of sterilisation, using this evidence. Given the large number of vaccination and sterilisation programmes conducted globally, the lack of studies available for review highlights a gap in data collection or reporting, essential for impact assessment. There are several knowledge gaps concerning the impact of the sterilisation component alone, as well as subsequent effects on rabies transmission and control. Prospective studies comparing the outcomes and impact of the two interventions would be required in order to establish any additional contribution of sterilisation, as well as the underlying mechanisms driving any changes. In the absence of such evidence, the priority for rabies control objectives should be implementation of mass vaccination, as currently recommended by the World Health Organisation.},

	abstract = {Interpreting the interplay between politics, social demographics and epidemiology is essential for understanding how a disease's occurrence and control evolve over time. Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus was first detected in Kenya in 1915 and serotyped in 1932. This review aims to describe and appraise initiatives to control FMD in Kenya since its independence from British rule in 1964, using information from the scientific literature. We describe the historical dynamics of FMD epidemiology in the country and determine socio-political factors that have shaped the control strategies used. PubMed, Scopus, CAB abstracts, Science Direct, Web of Science and Google Scholar were used to search and retrieve papers, using predetermined search criteria encompassing FMD, Kenya and disease control programme descriptors. In total 1234 papers were identified and screened for relevance using the World Health Organization's guidelines for rapid review. Ultimately 69 references from this search were included, and information extracted and consolidated. These papers highlight that following independence, there was a structured effort to control FMD consisting of a compulsory subsidised vaccination programme in the Rift Valley with movement controls and quarantine when outbreaks occurred. This programme led to an initial decrease in recorded FMD outbreaks. However, endemic circulation continued and this programme was discontinued due to multiple factors, including political deprioritisation and changes in the structure of veterinary services. Only low levels of active surveillance have been applied since 1964; most surveillance is passive and relies on outbreak reports. Currently control focuses on outbreak management and a mixture of public- and privately-funded vaccination. This review highlights critical drivers influencing disease control programme implementation including veterinary service structure, the active participation of stakeholders with farming systems and availability of affordable and matched FMD vaccine. Additionally, it appraises the availability of historical information and draws attention to gaps in the historical record.},

The purpose of this study is to systematically review the preclinical studies regarding sex differences in OA, with particular attention to the molecular aspect and gene expression, but also to the histopathological aspects. Three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Knowledge) were screened for eligible studies. In vitro and in vivo papers written in English, published in the last 11 years (2009-2020) were eligible. Participants were preclinical studies, including cell cultures and animal models of OA, evaluating sex differences. Independent extraction of articles and quality assessments were performed by two authors using predefined data fields and specific tools (Animals in Research Reporting In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guideline and Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) tool). Twenty-three studies were included in the review: 4 in vitro studies, 18 in vivo studies, and 1 both in vitro and in vivo study. From in vitro works, sex differences were found in the gene expression of inflammatory molecules, hormonal receptors, and in responsiveness to hormonal stimulation. In vivo research showed a great heterogeneity of animal models mainly focused on the histopathological aspects rather than on the analysis of sex-related molecular mechanisms. This review highlights that many gaps in knowledge still exist; improvementsin the selection and reporting of animal models, the use of advanced in vitro models, and multiomics analyses might contribute to developing a personalized gender-based medicine.},

Systematic sorting of the results allowed identification of consultation 'success factors' cited in peer-reviewed veterinary literature which were appraised using an appropriate critical appraisal tool (AXIS). Searches returned 11 330 results with a total of 17 publications meeting the inclusion criteria, of which four measured consultation success. Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association was the most common journal of publication (9 of 17) and the majority of included papers had been published since 2010 (12 of 17). Success factors measured were compliance, client satisfaction and veterinary surgeon satisfaction, and publications primarily used communication analysis tools to measure success.

	abstract = {Background: Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a mosquito-borne virus that is primarily found in North America and the Caribbean. Over the past decade there has been an increase in virus activity, including large outbreaks in human and horse populations. Predicted climate change is expected to affect the range of mosquitoes including vectors of EEEV, which may alter disease risk posing a public health concern. Methods: A scoping review (ScR) was conducted to identify and characterize the global evidence on EEEV. A thorough search was conducted in relevant bibliographic databases and government websites. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts for relevance and the characteristics of relevant articles were extracted using a uniformly implemented data collection form. The study protocol was developed a priori and described the methods and tools used and this article follows the PRISMA-ScR guidelines for reporting ScRs. Results: The ScR included 718 relevant research articles. The majority of the articles originated from North America (97\%) between 1933 and 2019. EEEV has been identified in 35 species of mosquitoes, over 200 species of birds, various domestic animals, wild mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. Articles identified in this ScR primarily covered three topic areas: epidemiology of hosts and vectors (344 articles) including surveillance results (138), pathogenesis of EEEV in hosts (193), and in vitro studies characterizing EEEV (111). Fewer articles evaluated the accuracy of diagnostic tests (63), the efficacy of mitigation strategies (62), transmission dynamics (56), treatment of EEEV in hosts (10), societal knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions (4), and economic burden (2). Conclusion: With the projected impact of climate change on mosquito populations, it is expected that the risk of EEEV could change resulting in higher disease burden or spread into previously unaffected areas. Future research efforts should focus on closing some of the important knowledge gaps identified in this ScR.},

	abstract = {Among the topics related to invasion science, the least studied are parasite co-introduction and spillback. This leads to an uncertainty in invasion ecology theories and applications to management. Therefore, the present study brings a systematic review of published information on the metazoan parasite fauna of Micropterus salmoides, a widely introduced fish, with the aim of comparing information about the composition and richness of the associated parasite communities in its native and introduced regions. This review demonstrates that there were twice as many studies of M. salmoides in its native region in comparison with introduced regions, although most of the studies focused on the analysis of a single species or taxon of parasite. This bias impacts the number of parasite species observed and, consequently, the apparent importance of enemy release in introduced regions. The composition of the parasite community in the two regions showed high similarity, which indicates the introduction and acquisition of parasites in introduced regions. Otherwise, there was no pattern related to the geographic distance, highlighting the influence of the propagule pressure and vector strength on the introduction of novel parasites. This illustrates the importance of vector strength on fish-parasite co-introduction and the necessity of new research examining host-parasite interactions with the parasite community of the invaded ecosystems. We still do not know the major influences of the composition of the parasite fauna of M. salmoides or how we can manage to develop a more restrictive vector pathway of introduction. The future of our ecosystems depends on how to account for current and future interactions among novel interactions, habitat, and climate change.},

The objective of this review was to examine the effect of grazing intensity in tropical pastures on the performance and productivity of beef cattle by a meta-analytical approach. The review followed a protocol developed and tested based on the PICOS strategy to formulate the guiding question: population (beef cattle), intervention (high grazing intensities), comparison (low grazing intensities), outcome (animal performance and productivity), and study design (experimental). Data were collected from papers published in the electronic databases of SCOPUS (Elsevier), Web of Science (Main collection), SpringerLink, Wiley Online Library, and Science Direct (Elsevier) by a single cross-reference search. The selected studies were considered relevant when they: (1) were primary research published in the format of a research article; (2) included grazing intensities as a management strategy; and (3) evaluated average daily gain (ADG, kg/animal per day), stocking rates (SR, animal unit (AU)/ha; AU = 450 kg), and weight gain per area (WGH, kg/ha). Thirteen manuscripts were selected due to their methodological strength for data extraction. The means under continuous stocking were 0.67 kg/animal per day for ADG, 518.12 kg/ha for WGH, and 4.19 AU/ha for SR. Under intermittent stocking, the means were 0.62 kg/animal per day for ADG, 980.18 kg/ha for WGH, and 5.10 AU/ha for SR. In tropical forages, the heights of 20 to 40 cm for pastures under continuous stocking and the defoliation intensities of 40 to 50\% for those under intermittent stocking result in greater individual performance and animal productivity per land area.},

Thus, this review compiled scientific findings on the applicability of carvacrol and thymol, or essential oils containing at least one of these compounds, for the treatment of wounds. METHODS: This review was performed at PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science databases using keywords as wound healing, thymol/carvacrol and essential oils. Thirteen studies were selected for discussion. KEY FINDINGS: Thymol/carvacrol was able to act in the three phases of wound healing. In the first phase, they showed modulatory effect of the inflammatory cytokines, oxidative stress and antimicrobial power. In the second phase, they promoted re-epithelialization, angiogenesis and development of granulation tissue. Finally, in the third phase, they improve the collagen deposition and modulated the growth of fibroblasts and keratinocytes. CONCLUSIONS: These compounds present a high potential for the development of new therapeutic for wound repair. However, dose, efficacy and safety of these compounds for the treatment of wounds, as well as the mechanisms by which those effects can be observed, are challenges for future studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over 400000 Americans annually undergo spinal fusion surgeries, yet up to 40\% of these procedures result in pseudoarthrosis even with iliac crest autograft, the current "gold standard" treatment. Tissue engineering has the potential to solve this problem via the creation of bone grafts involving bone-promoting growth factors (e.g., bone morphogenetic protein 2). A broad assessment of experimental growth factors is important to inform future work and clinical potential in this area. To date, however, no study has systematically reviewed the investigational growth factors utilized in preclinical animal models of spinal fusion. AIM: To review all published studies assessing investigational growth factors for spinal fusion in animal models and identify promising agents for translation. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature using PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases with searches run on May 29(th), 2018. The search query was designed to include all non-human, preclinical animal models of spinal fusion reported in the literature without a timespan limit. Extracted data for each model included surgical approach, level of fusion, animal species and breed, animal age and sex, and any other relevant characteristics. The dosages/sizes of all implant materials, spinal fusion rates, and follow-up time points were recorded. The data were analyzed and the results reported in tables and text. PRISMA guidelines were followed for this systematic review. RESULTS: Twenty-six articles were included in this study, comprising 14 experimental growth factors: AB204 (n = 1); angiopoietin 1 (n = 1); calcitonin (n = 3); erythropoietin (n = 1); basic fibroblast growth factor (n = 1); growth differentiation factor 5 (n = 4), combined insulin-like growth factor 1 + transforming growth factor beta (n = 4); insulin (n = 1); NELL-1 (n = 5); noggin (n = 1); P-15 (n = 1); peptide B2A (n = 2); and secreted phosphoprotein 24 (n = 1). The fusion rates of the current gold standard treatment (autologous iliac crest bone graft, ICBG) and the leading clinically used growth factor (BMP-2) ranged widely in the included studies, from 0-100\% for ICBG and from 13\%-100\% for BMP-2. Among the identified growth factors, calcitonin, GDF-5, NELL-1, and P-15 resulted in fusion rates of 100\% in some cases. In addition, six growth factors - AB204, angiopoietin 1, GDF-5, insulin, NELL-1, and peptide B2A - resulted in significantly enhanced fusion rates compared to ICBG, BMP-2, or other internal control in some studies. Large heterogeneity in animal species, fusion method, and experimental groups and time points was observed across the included studies, limiting the direct comparison of the growth factors identified herein. CONCLUSION: Several promising investigational growth factors for spinal fusion have been identified herein; directly comparing the fusion efficacy and safety of these agents may inform clinical translation.},

	abstract = {Pseudarthrosis following spinal fusion is correlated with poorer patient outcomes and consequently is an area of continued interest within spinal research. Recently, bioactive glasses have been proposed as a means of augmenting fusion rates. Here, we present the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the existing preclinical and clinical literature on the effect of bioactive glasses on spinal fusion. Using the MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases, we queried all publications in the English-language literature examining the effect of bioactive glasses on spinal fusion. The primary endpoint was fusion rate at last follow-up and the secondary endpoint for clinical studies was the rate of deep wound infection. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed independently for the preclinical and clinical data. Twelve preclinical studies (267 animals) and 12 clinical studies (396 patients) evaluating a total of twelve unique bioactive glass formulations were included. Across clinical studies, fusion was seen in 84\% treated with bioactive glass. On sub-analysis, fusion rates were similar for standalone autograft (91.6\%) and bioactive glass-local autograft mixtures (89.6\%). Standalone bioactive glass substrates produced inferior fusion rates relative to autograft alone (33.6\% vs. 98.8\%; OR 0.01, p {\textless} 0.02). Rates of deep wound infection did not differ between the bioactive glass and autograft groups (3.1\%). The preclinical data similarly showed comparable rates of fusion between autograft and bioactive glass-treated animals. The available data suggest that bioactive glass-autograft mixtures confer similar rates of spinal fusion relative to standalone autograft without altering the risk of deep wound infection.},

	abstract = {The growing frequency of bluetongue virus (BTV) incursions in Europe in recent years led to the largest BTV outbreak ever recorded in 2006/09, with a dramatic impact on the cattle and sheep industries. The complex epidemiology of this vector-borne disease of ruminants and its recent emergence need to be better understood to identify and implement efficient control strategies. Mathematical models provide useful tools for that purpose; many of them have been developed in the light of the 2006/09 outbreak. We aimed to provide a systematic review of compartmental mathematical models dedicated to BTV occurrence or transmission in European countries, to assess robustness of findings to different modelling approaches and assumptions. We identified relevant papers from PubMed and Scopus databases, 21 of which were included in the review following the selection process laid out in the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. We systematically extracted data from these papers to address the diversity and evolution of modelling approaches, and to identify important characteristics for future model development. Then, we summarized the main insights provided into bluetongue epidemiology, and discussed the relevance of these models as tools for risk mapping and for the design of surveillance and control systems. On the whole, the mechanistic models reviewed provided flexible frameworks, yielding mostly epidemiological insights specific to geographical areas and study periods. Despite the limitations of these models that sometimes relied on strong assumptions, we advocate their use to facilitate and inform evidence-based decision-making in animal health.},

	abstract = {Despite over three decades of active research, musculoskeletal injuries (MSI) remain a global problem for the Thoroughbred (TB) racing industry. High-speed exercise history (HSEH) has been identified as an important risk factor for MSI. However, the nature of this relationship remains unclear, with an apparent protective effect of HSE against injury, before it becomes potentially harmful. Many MSI cases and fatalities occur during training rather than during racing, resulting in an underestimation of injury from studies focused on race day. The objective of this study was to examine the current evidence of the effect of combined training and racing HSEH on MSI in TB flat racehorses, through a systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic search of the relevant literature was performed using PubMedR, ScopusR, Web of ScienceR, and EmbaseR online databases and the gray literature using sites containing ".edu" or ".edu.au". Studies included in the review had explored seven different measures of HSE, including total career HSE distance, cumulative HSE distance in the 30 and 60 days before MSI, average HSE distance per day, per event and per 30 days, and the total number of HSE events. The total cumulative career HSE distance significantly affected the odds of MSI, with every 5-furlong increase, the odds of MSI increased by 2\% (OR = 1.02; 95\% CI 1.01, 1.03; p = 0.004). The average HSE distance per day also affected the odds of MSI, with every additional furlong increasing the odds of MSI by 73\% (OR = 1.73; 95\% CI 1.29, 2.31; p {\textless} 0.001). Other measures of HSE were not found to be consistently associated with risk of MSI, but these results should be interpreted with caution. Significant methodological limitations were identified and influence the comparability of studies. Standardizing the measures of HSE in studies of MSI, and describing training conditions in more detail, would support a more thorough investigation of the relationship between HSE and MSI. An improved understanding of this relationship is critical to mitigating the impact of MSI in the Thoroughbred racehorse.},

	abstract = {Sperm counts have shown a progressive decline across the world since the mid-1900s. Global rates of obesity have been climbing at a similarly alarming rate, suggesting that these two factors may be linked. However, studies examining the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and male fertility have produced conflicting results. These discrepancies among studies are commonly attributed to limitations that are inherent in human studies such as correlational data and confounding factors-limitations that are absent from animal studies. Hence, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of animal studies that experimentally induced obesity with a high-fat diet and measured impacts on sperm traits and/or male fertility. Overall, we found strong, consistent evidence in animal studies that high-fat diets are detrimental for male fertility. Compared with controls, males fed a high-fat diet had smaller testes and sex accessory glands relative to body size, reduced semen quality, reduced mating success, and reduced fertilization success. This is the first time that experimental data of high-fat diet effects on male reproduction have been synthesized in a meta-analysis, and thus, our results provide novel insight to the complex question of how dietary-induced obesity affects male fertility. The strong negative effects detected in animal models suggest that the inconsistent results plaguing human studies are an artefact of limitations inherent in correlational studies rather than a true effect.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is a widespread public health concern in the poorest regions of the world. The principal control strategy is regular praziquantel administration to school-aged children in endemic areas. With calls for the elimination of schistosomiasis as a public health problem, expanding praziquantel delivery to all community members has been advocated. This systematic review and meta-analysis compares the impact of community-wide and child-targeted praziquantel distribution on schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity in school-aged children. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science to identify papers that reported schistosome prevalence before and after praziquantel administration, either to children only or to all community members. Extracted data included Schistosoma species, drug administration strategy, number of treatment rounds, follow-up interval and prevalence and intensity before and after treatment. We used inverse variance weighted generalised linear models to examine the impact of mass versus targeted drug administration on prevalence reduction, and weighted boxplots to examine the impact on infection intensity reduction. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018095377. In total, 34 articles were eligible for systematic review and 28 for meta-analysis. Schistosoma mansoni was reported in 20 studies; Schistosoma haematobium in 19 studies, and Schistosoma japonicum in two studies. Results of generalised linear models showed no detectable difference between mass and targeted treatment strategies on prevalence reduction in school-aged children for S. mansoni (odds ratio 0.47, 95\%CI 0.13-1.68, p = 0.227) and S. haematobium (0.41, 95\%CI 0.06-3.03, p = 0.358). Box plots also showed no apparent differences in intensity reduction between the two treatment strategies. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this meta-analysis do not support the hypothesis that community-wide treatment is more effective than targeted treatment at reducing schistosomiasis infections in children. This may be due to the relatively small number of included studies, insufficient treatment coverage, persistent infection hotspots and unmeasured confounders. Further field-based studies comparing mass and targeted treatment are required.},

METHODS: Electronic databases were searched, in addition to performing hand searches and a gray literature search. Titles and abstracts were searched according to the inclusion criteria and full texts were selected to be included in this systematic review. Data was extracted from each article and risk of bias was assessed for individual studies. RESULTS: Most studies reported that the treatment using a variety of stem cells resulted in significantly greater cementum regeneration. CONCLUSIONS: Because of variations in additional factors included in each study and varied risk of bias among those studies, the effect of each type of stem cell on cementum regeneration in dogs is difficult to clarify. Additional information needs to be obtained from each study in order to further analyze the individual effect of stem cells on cementum regeneration in dogs.},

Despite the positive effects of Col from marine origin, there is still limited understanding of the effects of this natural biomaterial in the process of wound healing in animal studies. In this context, the purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature to examine the effects of Col from different marine species in the process of skin tissue healing using experimental models of skin wound. The search was carried out according to the orientations of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA), and the descriptors of the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) were defined: "marine collagen," "spongin," "spongin," "skin," and "wound." A total of 42 articles were retrieved from the databases PubMed and Scopus. After the eligibility analyses, this review covers the different marine sources of Col reported in 10 different papers from the beginning of 2011 through the middle of 2019. The results were based mainly on histological analysis and it demonstrated that Col-based treatment resulted in a higher deposition of granulation tissue, stimulation of re-epitalization and neoangiogenesis and increased amount of Col of the wound, culminating in a more mature morphological aspect. In conclusion, this review demonstrates that marine Col from different species presented positive effects on the process of wound skin healing in experimental models used, demonstrating the huge potential of this biomaterial for tissue engineering proposals.},

	abstract = {Nutrition is a modifiable factor potentially related to aging. Milk and other dairy products may contribute to the prevention of physical and cognitive impairment. We conducted a systematic review to investigate the effectiveness of dairy product intake for preventing cognitive decline, sarcopenia, and frailty in the elderly population. A systematic search for publications in electronic databases [MEDLINE via PubMed, Embase, Scopus, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews] from 2009 to 2018 identified observational and interventional studies in English and Spanish that tested the relation between dairy product consumption and cognitive decline, sarcopenia, and frailty in community-dwelling older people. We assessed the participants, the type of exposure or intervention, the outcomes, and the quality of evidence. We screened a total of 661 records and included 6 studies (5 observational prospective cohort studies and 1 randomized controlled trial). Regarding cognitive impairment, the relation cannot be firmly established. Consumption of milk at midlife may be negatively associated with verbal memory performance. In older women, high intakes of dairy desserts and ice cream were associated with cognitive decline. On the other hand, 1 study demonstrated a significant inverse relation between dairy intake and development of Alzheimer disease among older Japanese subjects. The consumption of dairy products by older people may reduce the risk of frailty, especially with high consumption of low-fat milk and yogurt, and may also reduce the risk of sarcopenia by improving skeletal muscle mass through the addition of nutrient-rich dairy proteins (ricotta cheese) to the habitual diet. Despite the scarcity of evidence on the topic, our systematic review shows that there are some positive effects of dairy products on frailty and sarcopenia, whereas studies concerning cognitive decline have contradictory findings.},

	abstract = {Bees and the pollination services they deliver are beneficial to both food crop production, and for reproduction of many wild plant species. Bee decline has stimulated widespread interest in assessing hazards and risks to bees from the environment in which they live. While there is increasing knowledge on how the use of broad-spectrum insecticides in agricultural systems may impact bees, little is known about effects of other pesticides (or plant protection products; PPPs) such as herbicides and fungicides, which are used more widely than insecticides at a global scale. We adopted a systematic approach to review existing research on the potential impacts of fungicides and herbicides on bees, with the aim of identifying research approaches and determining knowledge gaps. While acknowledging that herbicide use can affect forage availability for bees, this review focussed on the potential impacts these compounds could have directly on bees themselves. We found that most studies have been carried out in Europe and the USA, and investigated effects on honeybees. Furthermore, certain effects, such as those on mortality, are well represented in the literature in comparison to others, such as sub-lethal effects. More studies have been carried out in the lab than in the field, and the impacts of oral exposure to herbicides and fungicides have been investigated more frequently than contact exposure. We suggest a number of areas for further research to improve the knowledge base on potential effects. This will allow better assessment of risks to bees from herbicides and fungicides, which is important to inform future management decisions around the sustainable use of PPPs.},

As consumption of animal protein and associated animal production is forecast to increase markedly over coming years in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), accurate monitoring of AMU has become imperative. We summarized data from 89 scientific studies reporting AMU data in animal production published in English since 1998, identified through the 'ISI Web of Knowledge' search engine. The aims were as follows: (a) to describe methodologies and metrics used to quantify AMU; (b) to summarize qualitative (on-farm prevalence of use) and quantitative (amounts of antimicrobial active principle) data, in order to identify food animal species at the highest risk of AMU; and (c) to highlight data gaps from LMICs. Only 17/89 (19.1\%) studies were conducted in LMICs. Sixty (67.3\%) reported quantitative data use, with 'daily doses per animal-time' being the most common metric. AMU was greatest in chickens (138 doses/1000 animal-days [inter quartile range (IQR) 91.1-438.3]), followed by swine (40.2 [IQR 8.5-120.4]), and dairy cattle (10.0 [IQR 5.5-13.6]). However, per kg of meat produced, AMU was highest in swine, followed by chickens and cattle. Our review highlights a large deficit of data from LMICs, and provides a reference for comparison with further surveillance and research initiatives aiming to reduce AMU in animal production globally.},

	abstract = {We report a systematic review and meta-analysis of research using animal models of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). We systematically searched 5 online databases in September 2012 and updated the search in November 2015 using machine learning and text mining to reduce the screening for inclusion workload and improve accuracy. For each comparison, we calculated a standardised mean difference (SMD) effect size, and then combined effects in a random-effects meta-analysis. We assessed the impact of study design factors and reporting of measures to reduce risks of bias. We present power analyses for the most frequently reported behavioural tests; 337 publications were included. Most studies (84\%) used male animals only. The most frequently reported outcome measure was evoked limb withdrawal in response to mechanical monofilaments. There was modest reporting of measures to reduce risks of bias. The number of animals required to obtain 80\% power with a significance level of 0.05 varied substantially across behavioural tests. In this comprehensive summary of the use of animal models of CIPN, we have identified areas in which the value of preclinical CIPN studies might be increased. Using both sexes of animals in the modelling of CIPN, ensuring that outcome measures align with those most relevant in the clinic, and the animal's pain contextualised ethology will likely improve external validity. Measures to reduce risk of bias should be employed to increase the internal validity of studies. Different outcome measures have different statistical power, and this can refine our approaches in the modelling of CIPN.},

	abstract = {Acute abdominal pain (colic) is the most common reason for emergency veterinary treatment in the horse. Consolidation of data through a systematic review is important to inform evidence-based medicine and clinical guidelines, but there are currently no published systematic reviews on colic in the horse. The aim of this study was to identify, categorize and appraise the evidence on factors associated with increased risk of developing abdominal pain (colic) due to gastrointestinal disease in the adult horse. A scoping review was performed to identify and categorize evidence on all risk factors for colic. A systematic review of management-related risk factors was then performed following PRISMA guidelines. Both searches were conducted in Medline, CAB Abstracts and Web of Science databases, and publications were assessed against inclusion and exclusion criteria. For the scoping review, study and participant characteristics of included publications and key results were extracted and tabulated. For the systematic review, cohort, case-control or cross-sectional studies investigating acute abdominal pain in horses within two weeks of management changes were assessed. Study characteristics, participant characteristics and study results of included publications for the systematic review were extracted and tabulated. Included publications were appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tools for cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies. The scoping review search identified 3,756 publications. Fifty eight studies met final inclusion criteria, and 22 categories of risk factors were identified. These were grouped into three broad areas: horse-related factors, management-related factors and environment-related factors. The largest body of evidence related to management change. The systematic review of management change identified 410 publications: 14 met inclusion criteria for analysis. These consisted of one cohort, eight case-control and five cross-sectional studies. The studies were conducted between 1990-2008, and the majority of studies were located in the USA (8/14) or UK (3/14). The risk factors related to management change that were assessed were feed, carer, exercise, pasture, water and housing. The largest bodies of evidence for increased risk of colic associated with management change were changes in feed (5/14 publications) and recent change in housing (3/14). Most studies (8/14) did not meet the JBI criterion on confounding factors. There was marked heterogeneity of study methodologies and measures. This is the first study to use a combined scoping and systematic review to analyse evidence for modifiable risk factors for a common condition in the horse. It provides a comprehensive review that will be a key resource for researchers, veterinary practitioners and horse owners. It identified modifiable risk factors associated with an increased risk of colic which should be a key target for preventative health programmes. The findings from the critical appraisal were used to develop recommendations for future research to improve the quality of evidence-based veterinary medicine.},

A search was performed on the Medline and Scopus electronic databases (2008-2019). Search terms were "mice", "brain", "treadmill", "exercise", "physical exercise". In the total, 430 were found but only 103 were included. Animals n = 1,172; exercised 4-8 weeks (Range 24 h to 32 weeks), 60 min/day (Range 8-120 min per day), and 10/12 m/min (Range 0.2 m/min to 36 m/min). Hippocampus, cerebral cortex, striatum and whole brain were more frequently investigated. Exercise improved learning and memory. Meta-analysis showed that exercise increased: cerebral BDNF in health (n = 150; z = 5.8, CI 3.43-12.05; p {\textless} 0.001 I2 = 94.3 \%), D (n = 124; z = 4.18, CI = 2.22-9.12; p {\textless} 0.001; I2 = 93.7 \%) and PD (n = 16 z = 4.26, CI 5.03-48.73 p {\textless} 0.001 I2 = 94.8 \%).

In conclusion, exercise improved brain and behavior, neurogenesis in healthy and dementia models, reduced toxicity and cerebral amyloid. Evidence regarding inflammation, oxidative stress and energy metabolism were scarce. Studies examining acute vs chronic exercise, extreme training and the durability of exercise benefit were rare.

Based on the developmental plasticity theory, early disturbances of synaptic availability of serotonin may promote phenotypic adaptations and late disorders of energy balance regulation leading to obesity and associated diseases. The aim of this systematic review is to determine the effects of pharmacological neonatal inhibition of serotonin reuptake by fluoxetine, on parameters related to feeding behavior and energy balance. Literature searches were performed in Medline/PubMed and Lilacs databases, out of which 9726 studies were found. Using predefined protocol and registered on CAMARADES website, 23 studies were included for qualitative synthesis. The internal validity was assessed using the SYRCLE's risk of bias toll. Kappa index was also measured for analyzing the concordance between the reviewers. In addition, the PRISMA statement was used for reporting this systematic review. Most of the included studies demonstrated that neonatal serotonin reuptake inhibition is associated with long term reduced body weight, lower fat mass and higher thermogenic capacity and mitochondrial oxygen consumption in key metabolic tissues. Therefore, experimental fluoxetine exposure during neonatal development may promote long-term changes related to energy balance associated with a lean phenotype.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate, through a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA), the efficacy of HyA, associated or not with other drugs, and PHyd in relieving lameness in horses with osteoarthritis. The searches for primary studies were conducted on four search platforms. The efficacy of HyA and PHyd was estimated through the relative risk difference method. Heterogeneity was observed in the efficacy of HyA, indicating long-term ineffectiveness of this drug when associated or not with anti-inflammatory drugs. In contrast, the results indicate that PHyd is an effective alternative therapy, with a long period of action in reducing lameness in horses with osteoarthritis. This study provides evidence that the application of PHyd and HyA is effective in reducing lameness caused by osteoarthritis in horses at different time periods, where PHyd has a longer time of action.},

For this purpose, five comprehensive electronic databases were investigated and relevant studies were identified for systematic review. The design and quality of the studies revealed notable variation, especially in the methods used for the detection and characterization of Brucella spp. This report provides helpful information about the health risk associated with the consumption of raw milk and relevant preventive strategies.},

The objectives of the study reported here were: (i) to identify and assess the evidence and knowledge gaps in published studies that have examined brucellosis in different food-producing animals in Mosul, Iraq; using systematic review approach, and (ii) to quantify the seroprevalence of brucellosis in the city using meta-analysis approach. Google Scholar was used as a search engine to track pertinent peer-reviewed research reports. The search was conducted on November 24, 2019. Keywords used were: brucella, animal, Mosul, Iraq. Peer-reviewed published studies, MSc theses, and PhD dissertations written in Arabic or English were included. Duplicate records were removed, and the screening process was conducted at three levels: titles, abstracts, and full-text articles. Identified studies that have reported the seroprevalence of brucellosis were included in a meta-analysis to calculate an overall prevalence. A total of 214 records were initially identified. Seventeen research reports were added from personal contact and qualified articles' references list. Thirty six articles were qualified for review after removing 35 duplicate records, 155 titles, 11 abstracts, and 5 full text articles. Seventeen studies reported the prevalence of brucellosis, 11 studies assessed different serological tests for diagnosis of brucellosis, 9 studies isolated Brucella spp. from animal specimens and/or animal products, and 4 studies assessed vaccination procedures against brucellosis. The overall seroprevalence of brucellosis in food-producing animals in Mosul over a period of 40 years was 14.14\%, including 14.46\% for sheep, 12.99\% for goats, 11.69\% for cattle, and 22.64\% for buffalo. The study concluded that the disease is evident in the city with increasing trends over the years, buffalo shows high seroprevalence, the degree of agreement of Rose-Bengal test as a screening test is fair compared to more accurate serological tests such as ELISA; and the disease constitutes a public health concern in the city. Additional studies are important to identify the overlooked predisposing factors, estimate the abortion rate attributable to brucellosis in food-producing animals, and evaluate efficacy of vaccination programs in reducing the prevalence of brucellosis and/or abortion rate.},

This meta-analysis quantitatively evaluates the effectiveness of multiple strategies on inhibiting RP numbers and their influence on ruminal fermentation and animal performance. This study compared 66 peer-reviewed articles (16 manuscripts for complete and 50 manuscripts for partial RP inhibition that used supplemental phytochemicals and lipids, published from 2000 to 2018, to inhibit RP in vivo. Data were structured to allow a meta-analytical evaluation of differences in response to different treatments (complete RP inhibition, phytochemicals, and lipids). Data were analyzed using mixed models with the random effect of experiment and weighted by the inverse of pooled standard error of the mean (SEM) squared. Supplemental phytochemicals and LCFA had no effects on inhibiting RP numbers; however, supplemental MCFA had a potent antiprotozoal effect. Both complete and partial RP (supplemental phytochemicals and lipids) inhibition decreased methane production, total tract digestibility of OM and NDF, and ruminal NH(3)-N concentration and increased propionate molar proportion. Methane production, molar proportions of acetate and propionate, total tract NDF digestibility were affected by the interaction of treatment (supplemental phytochemicals and lipids) and RP numbers. Supplemental phytochemicals and lipids can be effective in reducing methane production when RP numbers is below 7 Log(10) cells/mL, especially by supplemental saponins, tannins, and MCFA. In terms of animal performance, supplemental tannins could be recommended to control methane emissions without affecting animal performance. However, their negative effects on total tract digestibility could be a drawback when feeding tannins to ruminants. The negative effects of supplemental lipids on milk fat composition should be considered when feeding lipids to ruminants. In conclusion, ruminal protozoa play important roles on methanogenesis, fiber digestion, and ruminal NH(3)-N concentration, regardless of experimental diets and conditions; supplemental phytochemicals and lipids can be effective on reducing methane production when RP numbers is below 7 Log10 cells/mL. Among these partial RP inhibition strategies, supplemental tannins could be recommended to control methane production.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this research was to develop and test methods for accessing and evaluating information on the biological plausibility of observed associations between exposures or interventions and outcomes to generate scientific evidence for action consistent with practice in systematic reviews. STUDY DESIGN: To undertake this research, we used the example of the observed associations between antimicrobial use in food animals and increased risks of human exposures to antimicrobial-resistant pathogens of zoonotic origin. METHODS: We conducted a scoping search using terms related to biological plausibility or mechanism to identify key references. As recommended by these references, we also used expert consultation with researchers and a public health informationist. We used their recommendations, which included expert consultation, to identify mechanisms relevant to biological plausibility of the association we selected to test. We used the reviews conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines Development Group in support of reducing antimicrobial use in food animal production to populate our model for assessing biological plausibility. RESULTS: We were able to develop a transparent model for biological plausibility based on the adverse outcome pathway used in toxicology and ecology. We were also able to populate this model using the WHO reviews. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of biological plausibility used transparent and validated methods to assess the evidence used in systematic reviews based on the observational studies accessed through searches of the scientific literature. Given the importance of this topic in systematic reviews and evidence-based decision-making, further research is needed to define and test the methodological approaches to access and properly evaluate information from the scientific literature.},

A systematic review was undertaken to explore the measurable impact of six conditions: arthritis, sheep measles, pleurisy, pneumonia, grass seeds and rib fractures, on the production of lamb and mutton across the meat value chain. Peer-reviewed scientific literature from three databases and non-peer-reviewed articles and reports from Australian government and non-government websites were searched between 11 and 17 November 2019. Original articles, including studies conducted in Australia and New Zealand, that had measurable impacts on conditions of interest were included. The search yielded 16 articles and reports and were classified as producer impact and/or processor impact studies. Mortalities were quantified for pneumonia and arthritis, with pneumonia having the highest impact for producers. Grass seed infestation resulted in the highest impact on carcase and liveweight losses compared to arthritis and pneumonia. Arthritis had the highest trim weight losses for both lamb and mutton and the highest rate of carcase condemnation. Grass seed was the only condition where other impacts on the processor (chain speed and staff relocation to the boning room) were quantified. Although quantifiable production and processing losses were available for some conditions, this review has highlighted that limited quantifiable data based on scientifically sound research were not available for other conditions. The evidence for some conditions found in this review can be used to target future research activities and to further assist producers in making informed management decisions on prevention and control.},

	abstract = {A growing body of evidence has shown that extracellular vesicles can be efficient as experimental therapeutics in pre-clinical models of skin wounds, but there is a significant unmet need to translate this to clinical utilization. The objectives of the current systematic review were to identify the strength of the therapeutic effects of EVs derived from stem cells in cutaneous wounds and to assess which EV-mediated mechanisms could be involved in the therapeutic response. PubMed, ISI Web of Science, and Scopus databases were systematically searched. We retrieved English-language articles published through June 2020. In vivo studies which applied stem cell-derived EVs were included for further analysis. The Risk of bias was assessed by the SYRCLE tool. We identified thirty-nine pre-clinical studies that evaluated the effects of EVs on the wound healing process. The included studies varied greatly in EVs isolation techniques, route of administration, EVs producing cells, and follow-up time. In vivo application revealed beneficial effects of EVs on accelerating wound closure and re-epithelialization in a dose-dependent manner. Elevated angiogenesis was reported in twelve eligible studies through multiple signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt, MAPK/ERK, and JAK/STAT. The well-known signaling pathway to inhibit scar formation was TGF-β2/SMAD2. However, all included studies were not blinded enough which may have introduced bias. Therefore, the transition of EV's efficacy into the clinics is deeply rooted in the following important factors: 1) pre-clinical studies with a lower risk of bias and longer follow-up time, and 2) consistent, reproducible, and feasible manufacturing of EVs production in a large-scale commercial program.},

This is a systematic review of epidemiological studies evaluating the association between exposure to cats and occurrence of VL in humans (HVL) or dogs (CVL). Among the six studies addressing CVL, one showed a higher chance of CVL in the presence of cats, one showed an inverse relationship between the presence of cats and CVL, and four were inconclusive. Among the four studies evaluating HVL, three were inconclusive, and one showed an association between the presence of cats and HVL among patients with renal transplantation. The inconsistency of the results, associated to the methodological weaknesses of the studies analyzed, does not allow a firm conclusion that there is co-occurrence between exposure to cats and VL. Methodologically robust studies should be performed to elucidate the role of cats in VL transmission.},

The novel immune suppressant, fingolimod, is a promising candidate to ameliorate stroke-induced damage. Fingolimod is efficacious in experimental ischemic models, but a rigorous meta-analysis is lacking that considers how different experiment variables affect outcomes.Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review of fingolimod in stroke models, with the aim of rigorously evaluating fingolimod's effects on reducing infarct volume improving neurological outcomes. Seventeen variables were evaluated as covariates for the source of heterogeneity, and effect sizes were combined by using normalized mean difference meta-analysis to evaluate efficacy. Study quality was evaluated by the CAMARADES ten-item checklist, and publication bias was evaluated by funnel plots and Egger's tests.Results: About 123 unduplicated articles were identified in the literature research. Of these papers, 118 articles were excluded after reading titles and abstracts. Another 17 articles were selected in this study. Study quality was moderate (median = 6; interquartile range = 4), and publication bias was statistically insignificant. fingolimod reduced infarct volume by 30.4\% (95\% CI 22.4\%-38.3\%; n = 24; I(2) = 90.0\%; p {\textless} 0.0001) and consistently enhanced neurobehavioral outcome by 34.2\% (95\% CI 23.1\%-45.2\%; n = 14; I(2) = 76.5\%; p {\textless} 0.0001). No single factors accounted for heterogeneity.Conclusions: Our rigorous statistical evaluation confirmed the neuroprotective properties of fingolimod.

	abstract = {Background: A number of randomised in vivo trials have to date investigated the health impacts of the genetic variants A1 and A2 of bovine beta-casein. The primary difference between these two genetic variants is the mutation leading to an amino acid exchange at a position 67 in the peptide chain. This systematic review evaluated the effects of bovine milk, beta-casein and pure beta-casomorphin7, in the form of orally administered nutritional ingredients, on possible incidence and risk for chronic digestive discomfort and development of incurable conditions and diseases in human and animal randomised controlled trials.; Scope and approach: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist, searches were performed for publications across 7 electronic databases (Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, EBSCO, PubMed, and Cochrane) up to and until July 2020, to identify randomised controlled trials. The subsequent search results were screened for relevance firstly by title, then abstract, and the chosen ones by full text, with additional screening of included articles reference lists.; Key findings and conclusions: In total 2006 peer-reviewed journal articles were identified and after applying exclusion criteria, 19 studies were deemed suitable for inclusion. Human-based and animal-based results from the clinical in vivo studies demonstrated that consumption of A2 beta-casein milk can lead to improved tolerance of milk via decline in the ubiquity of gut related discomfort. However, the exact mechanism for these effects or specific individuals that may benefit from A2 beta-casein milk as opposed to A1 beta-casein milk is still poorly understood. Notably, consumption of A2 beta-casein milk had very low to completely no effect on the other health statuses investigated, particularly non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and diabetes. Based on current data, there is not sufficient evidence to merit public health authority recommendations related to the consumption and health associations of A1 beta-casein milk or A2 beta-casein milk. Interestingly, regardless of the scientific evidence between A2 beta-casein milk and health, this milk continues to gain prominence on the market, thus further functional research is required to understand the mechanisms of action of these identified peptides and gene variants and any implications A1 or A2 beta-casein milk may have on human health and techno-functional properties of milks.},

After compilation of relevant scientific publications available from the literature between 1990 and 2016, and applying exclusion and inclusion criteria, meta-analyses of data from dairy and beef cattle were applied for the pooled dataset or for each animal category (dairy or beef). The results of meta-analysis of all three datasets (all cattle, dairy cattle, or beef cattle) suggested that effect size of yeast either on daily CH(4) production or on CH(4) production per dry matter intake (CH(4)/DMI) was not significant. The results of Q test and I(2) statistic suggest that there is no heterogeneity between different studies on CH(4) production and CH(4)/DMI.

The present study was conducted to provide an overview of the prevalence of Cryptosporidium based on water. In this regard, some databases such as Scopus, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were screened in order to retrieve the related citations from 1 January 1983 to 10 September 2019. The pooled prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. was calculated by using a random effect model (REM) based on defined subgroups, including countries, water type, treatment conditions (treated and untreated), economic condition, World Health Organization (WHO) regions, and method of detection. In contrast, this index for treated and untreated water was 25.7\% and 40.1\%, respectively. Also, the overall prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. among all water types was defined as 36 (95\% CI: 31.4-40.7). The rank order of prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. based on water type was wastewater (46.9\%) {\textgreater} surface water (45.3\%) {\textgreater} raw water (31.6\%) {\textgreater} drinking water (25.5\%) {\textgreater} reservoirs water (24.5\%) {\textgreater} groundwater (18.8\%) {\textgreater} swimming pool water (7.5\%) {\textgreater} marine water (0.20\%). Identifying the key contributing factors to Cryptosporidium spp. survival can help provide solutions at both local and global scales.},

	abstract = {Resveratrol (RSV) has been reported to have potential beneficial effects in the complicated pregnancy. Various pregnancy complications lead to a suboptimal in utero environment that impacts fetal growth during critical windows of development. Detrimental structural changes to key organ systems in utero persist into adult life and predispose offspring to an increased risk of chronic non-communicable metabolic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the effect of gestational RSV exposure on both maternal and fetal outcomes. Publicly available databases (n = 8) were searched for original studies reporting maternal and/or fetal outcomes after RSV exposure during pregnancy irrespective of species. Of the 115 studies screened, 31 studies were included in this review. RSV exposure occurred for different durations across a range of species (Rats n = 18, Mice n = 7, Japanese Macaques n = 3 and Sheep n = 3), models of complicated pregnancy (eg. maternal dietary manipulations, gestational diabetes, maternal hypoxia, teratogen exposure, etc.), dosages and administration routes. Maternal and fetal outcomes differed not only based on the model of complicated pregnancy assessed but also as a result of species. Given the heterogenic nature of these studies, further investigation assessing RSV exposure during the complicated pregnancy is warranted. In order to make an informed decision regarding the use of RSV to intervene in pregnancy complications, we suggest a minimum data set for consideration in future studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in humans in 2012. A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize current knowledge and identify critical knowledge gaps. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a systematic review on MERS-CoV using PRISMA guidelines. We identified 407 relevant, peer-reviewed publications and selected 208 of these based on their contributions to four key areas: virology; clinical characteristics, outcomes, therapeutic and preventive options; epidemiology and transmission; and animal interface and the search for natural hosts of MERS-CoV. RESULTS: Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4/CD26) was identified as the human receptor for MERS-CoV, and a variety of molecular and serological assays developed. Dromedary camels remain the only documented zoonotic source of human infection, but MERS-like CoVs have been detected in bat species globally, as well as in dromedary camels throughout the Middle East and Africa. However, despite evidence of camel-to-human MERS-CoV transmission and cases apparently related to camel contact, the source of many primary cases remains unknown. There have been sustained health care-associated human outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and South Korea, the latter originating from one traveler returning from the Middle East. Transmission mechanisms are poorly understood; for health care, this may include environmental contamination. Various potential therapeutics have been identified, but not yet evaluated in human clinical trials. At least one candidate vaccine has progressed to Phase I trials. CONCLUSIONS: There has been substantial MERS-CoV research since 2012, but significant knowledge gaps persist, especially in epidemiology and natural history of the infection. There have been few rigorous studies of baseline prevalence, transmission, and spectrum of disease. Terms such as "camel exposure" and the epidemiological relationships of cases should be clearly defined and standardized. We strongly recommend a shared and accessible registry or database. Coronaviruses will likely continue to emerge, arguing for a unified "One Health" approach.},

	abstract = {Background: Arbovirus infections have steadily become a major pandemic threat. This study aimed at investigating the existence of host epigenetic markers arising from the principal arboviruses infections impacting on human health. We set to systematically review all published evidence describing any epigenetic modifications associated with infections from arboviruses, including, but not limited to, microRNAs, DNA methylation, and histone modifications. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted using the electronic databases PubMed, Science Direct and Cochrane Library from inception to January 4th, 2018. We included reports describing original in vivo or in vitro studies investigating epigenetic changes related to arbovirus infections in either clinical subjects or human cell lines. Studies investigating epigenetic modifications related to the virus or the arthropod vector were excluded. A narrative synthesis of the findings was conducted, contextualizing comparative evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies. Results: A total of 853 unique references were identified and screened by two independent researchers. Thirty-two studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. The evidence was centered mainly on microRNA and DNA methylation signatures implicated with secondary Dengue fever. Evidence for recent epidemic threats, such as the infections by Zika or Chikungunya viruses is still scant. Conclusions: Major epigenetic alterations found on arboviruses infections were miR-146, miR-30e and the Dicer complex. However, existing studies frequently tested distinct hypotheses resulting in a heterogeneity of methodological approaches. Whilst epigenetic signatures associated with arbovirus infections have been reported, existing studies have largely focused on a small number of diseases, particularly dengue. Validation of epigenetic signatures have an untapped potential, but concerted investigations are certainly required to deliver robust candidates of clinical utility for diagnosis, staging and prognosis of specific arboviral diseases.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles were selected from Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, LILACS-Bireme, and BBO electronic databases using keywords obtained from Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). Of 1540 potentially eligible studies, 157 were selected for full text analysis. Five independent reviewers (Kappa = 0.89) selected the studies, abstracted information, and assessed quality based on standardized scales. After the analysis, 78 studies comparing bovine teeth to human teeth were found. Only 18 studies comparing bovine and human substrates in bond strength tests were included in the systematic review and 13 in the meta-analysis. Two authors independently selected the studies, extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. Mean differences were obtained by comparing tensile and shear bond strengths between human and bovine teeth (permanent and deciduous) and considering enamel and dentin separately (subgroup analysis). Statistical analysis was performed using RevMan5.1, with a random-effect model, at a 5\% significance level. RESULTS: No significant difference was found between human and bovine teeth in tensile tests (p = 0.41) for dentin (p = 0.86), but there was a difference for enamel (p = 0.01). Regarding shear bond strength, no significant difference was found between human and bovine teeth (p = 0.16) either for enamel (p = 0.07) or dentin (p = 0.68). Regarding shear bond strength on deciduous teeth, no significant difference was found between human and bovine substrates (p = 0.54), either for enamel (p = 0.42) or dentin (p = 0.05). Most studies were at high (low or unclear) risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: In shear bond strength testing, bovine teeth can be a suitable alternative for permanent and deciduous human teeth, for both enamel and dentin substrates. However, they may not be suitable for enamel tensile bond strength testing. The findings are based on low quality studies (considerable heterogeneity) and should be interpreted with caution.},

	abstract = {In recent years, new genome editing technologies have emerged that can edit the genome of non-human animals with progressively increasing efficiency. Despite ongoing academic debate about the ethical implications of these technologies, no comprehensive overview of this debate exists. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a systematic review of the reasons reported in the academic literature for and against the development and use of genome editing technologies in animals. Most included articles were written by academics from the biomedical or animal sciences. The reported reasons related to seven themes: human health, efficiency, risks and uncertainty, animal welfare, animal dignity, environmental considerations and public acceptability. Our findings illuminate several key considerations about the academic debate, including a low disciplinary diversity in the contributing academics, a scarcity of systematic comparisons of potential consequences of using these technologies, an underrepresentation of animal interests, and a disjunction between the public and academic debate on this topic. As such, this article can be considered a call for a broad range of academics to get increasingly involved in the discussion about genome editing, to incorporate animal interests and systematic comparisons, and to further discuss the aims and methods of public involvement. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The ecology and evolution of prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems'.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subfebrile temperatures and fever in the first days after stroke are associated with a greater risk of a poor outcome. If this relation is causal, prevention of hyperthermia may improve outcome. Causality can be tested in animal models. We therefore assessed the effects of hyperthermia on outcomes in animal models of ischaemic stroke and explored under which conditions prevention of hyperthermia could be most effective. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from animal experiments testing the effect of spontaneous or induced hyperthermia on outcome after focal cerebral ischaemia. Our primary outcome measure was infarct size. Normalised mean differences were combined using the random effects model and stratified meta-analysis was used to explore the impact of study characteristics. RESULTS: We included 19 publications, reporting on 49 comparisons involving 603 animals. Overall, hyperthermia increased infarct size by 43.4\% (95\% confidence interval, 29.8-56.9\%) and worsened neurobehavioral outcomes by 48.5\% (17.2-79.8\%). The increase in infarct size was larger with higher temperatures. Hyperthermia was most harmful if present for more than 2 h and when started at the time of artery occlusion rather than later. CONCLUSION: Hyperthermia substantially increased infarct size in animal models of ischaemic stroke, suggesting that the relation between fever and poor outcome observed in patients is at least in part causal. These data provide support to trials testing the effect of the prevention of fever with antipyretic drugs in patients with acute stroke.},

In this meta-analysis, we compared the effect of training volume on antioxidant enzymatic resource and lipid peroxidation on various brain regions.

The effects of training periods (weeks) and exercise duration were compared. Meta-analysis revealed that protocols over 8 weeks were associated with an increase in SOD (p =  0.0008) and CAT activities (p =  0.0001). Exercise durations for 30 and 60 min were associated with higher CAT activity (p =  0.04). Joint analysis revealed that moderate physical exercise over 4 and 8 weeks promoted a healthy enzymatic balance. However, high volumes of exercise over 8 weeks were associated with the increased antioxidant enzymatic activity, indicating higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. The data also indicated that there is still limited research and inaccurate information, on the safety conditions of training periods that simulate tests of ultra resistance in humans.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The choice of the most suitable litter treatment should be based on scientific evidence. This systematic review assessed the effectiveness of litter treatments on ammonia concentration, pH, moisture and pathogenic microbiota of the litter and their effects on body weight, feed intake, feed conversion and mortality of broilers. METHODS: The systematic literature search was conducted using PubMed (Medline), Google Scholar, ScienceDirect and Scielo databases to retrieve articles published from January 1998 to august 2019. Means, standard deviations and sample sizes were extracted from each study. The response variables were analyzed using the mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD), (litter treatment minus control group). All variables were analyzed using random effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: Subgroup meta-analysis revealed that acidifiers reduce pH (P{\textless}0.001), moisture (P = 0.002) ammonia (P = 0.011) and pathogenic microbiota (P {\textless}0.001) of the litter and improves the weight gain (P = 0.019) and decreases the mortality rate of broilers (P{\textless}0.001) when compared with controls. Gypsum had a positive effect on ammonia reduction (P = 0.012) and improved feed conversion (P = 0.023). Alkalizing agents raise the pH (P = 0.035), worsen feed conversion (P{\textless}0.001), increase the mortality rate (P {\textless}0.001), decrease the moisture content (P{\textless}0.001) and reduce the pathogenic microbiota of the litter (P{\textless}0.001) once compared to controls. Superphosphate and adsorbents reduce, respectively, pH (P{\textless}0.001) and moisture (P = 0.007) of the litter compared to control groups. CONCLUSION: None of the litter treatments influenced the feed intake of broilers. Meta-analyses of the selected studies showed positive and significant effects of the litter treatments on broiler performance and litter quality when compared with controls. Alkalizing was associated with worse feed conversion and high mortality of broilers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: National pediatric vaccination programs have been introduced in Latin America (LatAm) to reduce the burden of diseases due to pathogens such as rotavirus, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and pneumococcus. Vaccination health benefits may extend to unvaccinated populations by reducing pathogen transmission. Understanding herd effect is important for implementation and assessment of vaccination programs. The objective was to conduct a systematic review of published epidemiological evidence of herd effect with Hib, rotavirus and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) in LatAm. METHODS: Searches were conducted in PubMed, Virtual Health Library (VHL), SciELO and SCOPUS databases, for studies reporting data on herd effect from Hib, rotavirus and PCV vaccination in LatAm, without age restriction. Searches were limited to articles published in English, Spanish or Portuguese (1990-2016). After screening and full-text review, articles meeting the selection criteria were included to be critically appraised following criteria for observational and interventional studies. The presence of a herd effect was defined as a significant decrease in incidence of disease, hospitalization, or mortality. RESULTS: 3,465 unique articles were identified, and 23 were included (Hib vaccine n = 5, PCV n = 8, rotavirus vaccine n = 10). Most studies included children and/or adolescents (age range varied between studies). Studies in adults, including older adults (aged {\textgreater} 65 years), were limited. Few studies reported statistically significant reductions in disease incidence in age groups not targeted for vaccination. Hib-confirmed meningitis hospitalization decreased in children but herd effect could not be quantified. Some evidence of herd effect was identified for PCV and rotavirus vaccine in unvaccinated children. Evidence for herd effects due to PCV in adults was limited. CONCLUSION: After introduction of Hib, PCV and rotavirus vaccination in LatAm, reductions in morbidity/mortality have been reported in children not targeted for vaccination. However, due to methodological limitations (e.g. short post-vaccination periods and age range studied), there is currently insufficient evidence to quantify the herd effect in adult populations. More research and higher quality surveillance is needed to characterize herd effect of these vaccines in LatAm.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: It is unclear if anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction can prevent the onset of degenerative changes in the knee. Previous studies were inconclusive on this subject. The aim of this study was to systematically review all studies on the effect of ACL reconstruction on articular cartilage in animals. DESIGN: Pubmed and Embase were searched to identify all original articles concerning the effect of ACL reconstruction on articular cartilage compared with both its positive (ACL transection) and negative (sham and/or non-operated) control in animals. Subsequently a Risk of bias and meta analysis was conducted based on five outcomes (gross macroscopic assessment, medical imaging, histological histochemical grading, histomophometrics and biomechanical characterization) related to articular cartilage. RESULTS: From the 19 included studies, 29 independent comparisons could be identified which underwent ACL reconstruction with an average timing of data collection of 23 weeks (range 1-104 weeks). Due to limited data availability meta-analysis could only be conducted for gross macroscopic damage. ACL reconstruction caused significant gross macroscopic damage compared with intact controls (SMD 2.0 [0.88; 3.13]). These findings were supported by individual studies reporting on histomorphometrics, histology and imaging. No significant gross macroscopic damage was found when ACL reconstruction was compared with ACL transection (SMD -0.64 [-1.85; 0.57]). CONCLUSION: This systematic review with an average follow up of included studies of 23 weeks (range 1-104 weeks) demonstrates that, in animals, ACL reconstruction does not protect articular cartilage from degenerative changes. The consistency of the direction of effect, provides some reassurance that the direction of effect in humans might be the same.},

The aim of this study was to conduct a review on VBD interventions relevant to housing and hygiene (including sanitation and waste management) in urban areas. Main body: We conducted a scoping review, which involved systematically searching peer-reviewed and grey literature published between 2000 and 2016 using five scientific databases and one database for grey literature. Different data extraction tools were used for data coding and extraction. We assessed the quality of each study using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool and extracted descriptive characteristics and data about implementation process and transferability from all studies using the Template for Intervention Description and Replication and ASTAIRE (a tool for analyzing the transferability of health promotion interventions) tools. We reviewed 44 studies. Overall, the studies were judged to be of high risk for bias. Our results suggest multifaceted interventions, particularly community-based interventions, have the potential to achieve wider and more sustained effects than do standard vertical single-component programs. The evaluations of multifaceted interventions tend to include integrated evaluations, using not only entomological indicators but also acceptability and sustainability indicators. Conclusions: This review highlighted the important need for higher quality research in VBDs and improved and standardized reporting of interventions. Significant research gaps were found regarding qualitative research and implementation research, and results highlighted the need for more interventions focus on sanitation and hygiene practices.},

Historical research models have provided insights into the underlying causes of these diseases but come with many limitations. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature regarding the advantage of organoid models in modeling benign and malignant colorectal pathology. DATA SOURCES: Sources included PubMed, Ovid-Medline, and Ovid Embase STUDY SELECTION:: Two reviewers completed a systematic review of the literature between January 2006 and January of 2020 for studies related to colon and intestinal organoids. Reviews, commentaries, protocols, and studies not performed in humans or mice were excluded. RESULTS: A total of 73 articles were included. Organoid models of colorectal disease have been rising in popularity to further elucidate the genetic, transcriptomic, and treatment response of these diseases at the individual level. Increasingly complex models utilizing coculture techniques are being rapidly developed that allow in vitro recapitulation of the disease microenvironment. LIMITATIONS: This review is only qualitative, and the lack of well utilized nomenclature in the organoid community may have resulted in the exclusion of articles. CONCLUSIONS: Historical disease models including cell lines, patient-derived tumor xenografts, and animal models have created a strong foundation for our understanding of colorectal pathology. Recent advances in 3-dimensional cell cultures, in the form of patient-derived epithelial organoids and induced human intestinal organoids have opened a new avenue for high-resolution analysis of pathology at the level of an individual patient. Recent research has shown the potential of organoids as a tool for personalized medicine with their ability to retain patient characteristics, including treatment response.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To perform a systematic literature review of the regenerative potential of bone substitutes used to fill critical size defects (CSDs) in rabbit calvariae; to determine the quality of the included studies using ARRIVE guidelines. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An Internet search was performed in duplicate using MEDLINE, PubMed and Google Scholar databases (without restrictions on publication date) for studies reporting the regenerative potential of bone substitutes in CSDs in rabbit calvariae. Four parameters were analyzed by histomorphometry: new bone formation (NB); defect closure (DC); residual graft (RG); and connective tissue (CT). Animal Research Reporting in In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines (a list of 20 aspects for scoring texts and ensuring comparison between different experimental studies in animals) were used to evaluate the quality of the selected works. RESULTS: Twenty-one manuscripts were included. CSDs with 15 mm were predominant (57.14\%). Only one study described the four histomorphometric parameters. NB formation was analyzed in 15 studies (71.42\%) and was higher for particulate autogenous bone grafts (range 52.1-82\%) after 12 weeks. DC was evaluated in six studies (28.57\%) and was higher for fragmented adipose tissue grafts (range 53.33-93.33\%) after 12 weeks. RG was evaluated in four studies (19.04\%) and was higher for hydroxyapatite/beta-tricalcium phosphate grafts with silica (HA/ß-TCP + Si) (range 35.78-47.54\%) at 12 weeks. CT was evaluated in two studies (9.5\%) and was higher for HA/ß-TCP + membrane (44.2\%) at 12 weeks. Quality evaluation identified three items (title, introduction/objectives and experimental procedure) (15\%) with excellent scores, 10 items (abstract, introduction/background, methods/ethical statement, experimental animals, experimental outcomes, statistics, results/baseline data, outcome/estimation and discussion interpretation/scientific implications) (50\%) with average scores, and seven items (housing and husbandry, sample size, allocation, numbers analyzed, adverse effects, general applicability/relevance and funding) (35\%) obtained poor scores. Only one manuscript obtained a quality evaluation considered as excellent. CONCLUSIONS: Autogenous bone grafts increase NB. DC is enhanced by the use of fragmented adipose tissue. RG remains in the defect for longer when hydroxyapatite/beta-tricalcium phosphate with silica is used, and more CT can be expected when hydroxyapatite/beta-tricalcium phosphate with silica grafts are covered by a membrane. The addition of stem cells of different origins to grafting materials enhances bone formation in early healing periods. The ARRIVE guidelines are still insufficiently used and the overall quality of studies remains low.},

A total of 272 eligible publications were identified from Medline, Scopus, Embase and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. Apparent and true seroprevalence were analysed by region using a novel Bayesian hierarchical model that allowed incorporating sensitivity and specificity of the applied serological assays. The true seroprevalence of T. gondii in pregnant women was 5.0\% or less in seven regions of China. The median of the regional true seroprevalences in pigs (24\%) was significantly higher than in cattle (9.5\%), but it was not significantly higher than in chickens (20\%) and small ruminants (20\%). This study represents the first use of a Bayesian hierarchical model to obtain regional true seroprevalence.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis, caused by Schistosoma japonicum, remains one of the most important parasitic diseases, and detection of S. japonicum infections in humans plays a crucial role in control and treatment. However, comparisons between the parasitological and the immunological examinations in the fields of China are lacking. Therefore we performed a meta-analysis to compare the seroprevalence of Schistosoma japonicum, as determined by IHA or ELISA, with coprological prevalence, as determined by Kato-Katz, and estimate the ratio of the serological to the egg-positive prevalence in order to evaluate the potential threat of egg-negative but worm-positive schistosomiasis. METHODS: Studies published up to July 2018 on the parasitological and immunological examinations of schistosomiasis in the fields of China were searched in five databases including CNKI, WanFang, VIP, PubMed and Web of Science. The ratio of the serological to the egg-positive prevalence and its 95\%CI for each study were calculated, and then point estimates and their 95\%CIs of pooled prevalence ratio were meta-analyzed. Subgroup meta-analyses were also performed according to potential influential factors. RESULTS: A total of 23 articles were included. The prevalence ratio varied from 0.57 to 48.83 for IHA to Kato-Katz and ranged from 0.38 to 13.97 for ELISA to Kato-Katz. The pooled ratio was 4.72 (95\%CI: 3.87{\textasciitilde} 5.76) for IHA to KK and 4.65 (95\%CI: 3.50{\textasciitilde} 6.17) for ELISA to KK. Subgroup analyses implied that the ratio of the serological to the egg-positive prevalence may decrease with the endemic levels. The highest prevalence ratio was observed when Kato-Katz was performed with three slides per stool or in hilly and mountainous regions. CONCLUSIONS: The worm-determined prevalence by IHA or ELISA is 4- to 5-fold higher than the egg-determined prevalence by Kato-Katz, which implied Kato-Katz may largely underestimate the prevalence of S. japonicum in China. The degree of underestimation was greater when Kato-Katz with three slides per stool was carried out, especially in low endemic areas or in hilly and mountainous regions. Therefore, more attention should be paid to those egg-negative but worm-positive patients with the aim of final elimination of S. japonicum in China.},

Summary odds ratios for specific exposures were as follows: indirect contact, OR = 1.39 (95\% CI 1.02, 1.89) (p = .04); eating, OR = 2.29 (95\% CI 1.13, 4.66) (p = .02); hunting, OR = 2.54 (95\% CI 1.21, 5.33) (p = .01). Most of the included studies had moderate risk of bias. Crude estimates were reduced by up to 24\% when adjusted for confounders (where reported). Direct contact with wild armadillos was strongly associated with an increased risk of HD, whilst evidence for an increased risk of HD from indirect contact was weaker. The fraction of HD in endemic countries attributable to zoonotic transmission from armadillos remains unknown, but the precautionary principle needs to be adopted to protect public health.},

	abstract = {Understanding the prevalence of M. leprae infection in armadillos is important because of evidence from Brazil and other countries of an association between contact with armadillos and the development of Hansen's Disease (leprosy). Our aim was to characterize studies which have investigated natural M. leprae infection in wild armadillos in Brazil, and to quantify and explore variability in the reported prevalence of infection. We conducted a systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42019155277) of publications in MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health, Scopus, LILACS, Biblioteca Digital Brasileira de Teses e Dissertações, Catálogo de Teses e Dissertações de CAPES, and Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde up to 10/2019 using Mesh and text search terms (in English, Portuguese, Spanish, and French). The 10 included studies represented a total sample of 302 armadillos comprising 207 (69\%) Dasypus novemcinctus, 67 (22\%) Euphractus sexcinctus, 16 (5\%) Priodontes maximus, 10 (3\%) Cabassous unicinctus, and 2 (1\%) Cabassous tatouay from 7 different states. Methods used included histopathology (4 studies), PGL-1 and LID-1 antigen detection (4 studies) and examination for clinical signs of disease (4 studies). Eight studies used PCR of which 7 targeted the RLEP repetitive element and 3 tested for inhibitory substances. M. leprae prevalence by PCR ranged from 0\% (in 3 studies) to 100\% in one study, with a summary estimate of 9.4\% (95\% CI 0.4\% to 73.1\%) and a predictive interval of 0-100\%. The average prevalence is equivalent to 1 in 10 armadillos in Brazil being infected with M. leprae, but wide variation in sample estimates means that the prevalence in any similar study would be entirely unpredictable. We propose instead that future studies aim to investigate transmission and persistence of M. leprae within and between armadillo populations, meanwhile adopting the precautionary principle to protect human health and an endangered species in Brazil.},

	abstract = {Osteoporosis is one of the most common skeletal disorders affecting a significant percentage of people worldwide. Research data suggested that systemic diseases such as osteoporosis could act as risk factors for osseointegration, jeopardizing the healing process and thus the predictability of dental implant success on compromised patients. It is well accepted that preclinical studies in animal models reproducing the osteoporotic condition are one of the most important stages in the research of new biomaterials and therapeutic modalities. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate whether osteoporosis compromises dental implant osseointegration in experimental osteoporotic-like conditions. A 3-stage systematic literature research was conducted in MEDLINE via OVID and EMBASE up to and including March 2017. Experimental studies reporting on dental implant osseointegration on different osteoporotic animal models were assessed. The studies had to report on the percentage of bone-to-implant contact (\%BIC) as the primary outcome. ARRIVE guidelines for reporting on animal research were applied to evaluate the methodological quality and risk of bias of the studies. Fifty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria and were assessed qualitatively. The most adopted animal model was the rat. A variability of \%BIC values was observed, ranging from 30\% to 99\% and from 26\% to 94\% for the healthy and osteoporotic group, respectively. The great majority (47) of the included studies concluded that estrogen deficiency significantly affects BIC values, 9 studies stated that it was not possible to observe statistical differences in BIC between ovariectomized and healthy groups and 1 study did not provide a comparison between the healthy and osteoporotic group. Owing to the great heterogeneity in implant surface, study design, observation time-points, site of implant placement and reported outcomes, a meta-analysis could not be performed. An overall high risk of bias was observed, owing to the limited information on animal housing and husbandry, baseline characteristics and health status, ethical statement and allocation to the experimental groups provided. Although the available studies seem to suggest a lower osseointegration in osteoporotic-like conditions, no robust conclusions can be drawn due to the great heterogeneity and overall low quality of the available studies. Future studies with emphasis on minimizing the possible sources of bias and evaluating osseointegration of dental implants placed into jawbones instead of long bones are warranted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The beef tapeworm, Taenia saginata, causing cysticercosis in bovines and taeniosis in humans, is thought to have a global distribution. In eastern and southern Africa, cattle production plays a crucial role in the economy, but a clear overview of the prevalence of T. saginata in the region is still lacking. This review aims to summarize existing knowledge on T. saginata taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis distribution in eastern and southern Africa. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted, that gathered published and grey literature, including OIE reports, concerning T. saginata taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis in eastern and southern Africa published between January 1st, 1990 and December 31st, 2017. RESULTS: A total of 1232 records were initially retrieved, with 78 full text articles retained for inclusion in the database. Unspecified taeniosis cases were reported for Angola, Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, whereas T. saginata taeniosis cases were found for Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The prevalence of taeniosis ranged between 0.2-8.1\% based on microscopy, and between 0.12-19.7\% based on coproAg-ELISA. In Ethiopia, the percentage of tapeworm self-reporting was high (45.0-64.2\%), and a substantial number of anthelmintic treatments were reported to be sold in towns. The presence of bovine cysticercosis was reported in all 27 countries/territories included in the study, except for Rwanda and Somalia, Comoros, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, Seychelles and Socotra. The prevalence of cysticercosis ranged between 0.02-26.3\% based on meat inspection, and between 6.1-34.9\% based on Ag-ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: Although T. saginata has been reported in the majority of countries/territories of the study area, T. saginata taeniosis/cysticercosis remains a largely ignored condition, probably due to the absence of symptoms in cattle, the lack of data on its economic impact, and the fact that human taeniosis is considered a minor health problem. However, the occurrence of bovine cysticercosis is a clear sign of inadequate sanitation, insufficient meat inspection, and culinary habits that may favour transmission. Measures to reduce transmission of T. saginata are therefore warranted and the infection should be properly monitored.},

Camels play significant role in the livelihood of the pastoralists and agro-pastoralists living in the fragile environments. The main purpose of this meta-analysis was to compute the pooled prevalence estimate of camel trypanosomosis based on the available studies. Published articles on camel trypanosomosis were searched in PubMed, Google scholar and African journals online (AJOL). The key electronic search words were: camel, trypanosomosis, Trypanosoma evansi, and surra. The preliminary screening of the articles was based on the title and abstract. The analysis was based on 11 cross-sectional study reports, which were done between the year 2008 and 2016, and in four administrative regions of Ethiopia. The pooled prevalence estimate in a random effects meta-analysis was 9.2\% (95\% CI 7.1-11.8). Enormous heterogeneity were noted among the studies (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=94.4\%). In subgroup and multivariable meta-regression analyses however, only two predictors namely sample size and diagnostic techniques were found to have significant effect (p{\textless}0.05). Accordingly, the aforementioned predictor sex explained 51.8\% of the explainable proportion of the heterogeneity noted between studies. In this regard, serological and molecular based reports were noted to have higher prevalence compared to wet smear and buffy coat. On the other hand, studies with smaller sample size had less prevalence compared to large sample size. Trypanosoma evansi is the only species identified and reported in all the study reports. This analysis results underscores the need for further study that involve more sensitive diagnostic techniques to reveal the precise magnitude of the disease, and to identify the vectors in all camel rearing areas of the country.},

	abstract = {Leptospirosis is a global zoonotic disease that the transmission is driven by complex geographical and temporal variation in demographics, animal hosts and socioecological factors. This results in complex challenges for the identification of high-risk areas. Spatial and temporal epidemiological tools could be used to support leptospirosis control programs, but the adequacy of its application has not been evaluated. We searched literature in six databases including PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Scopus, SciELO and Zoological Record to systematically review and critically assess the use of spatial and temporal analytical tools for leptospirosis and to provide general framework for its application in future studies. We reviewed 115 articles published between 1930 and October 2018 from 41 different countries. Of these, 65 (56.52\%) articles were on human leptospirosis, 39 (33.91\%) on animal leptospirosis and 11 (9.5\%) used data from both human and animal leptospirosis. Spatial analytical (n = 106) tools were used to describe the distribution of incidence/prevalence at various geographical scales (96.5\%) and to explored spatial patterns to detect clustering and hot spots (33\%). A total of 51 studies modelled the relationships of various variables on the risk of human (n = 31), animal (n = 17) and both human and animal infection (n = 3). Among those modelling studies, few studies had generated spatially structured models and predictive maps of human (n = 2/31) and animal leptospirosis (n = 1/17). In addition, nine studies applied time-series analytical tools to predict leptospirosis incidence. Spatial and temporal analytical tools have been greatly utilized to improve our understanding on leptospirosis epidemiology. Yet the quality of the epidemiological data, the selection of covariates and spatial analytical techniques should be carefully considered in future studies to improve usefulness of evidence as tools to support leptospirosis control. A general framework for the application of spatial analytical tools for leptospirosis was proposed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bovine viral diarrhea is an infectious disease that causes symptoms such as bovine diarrhea and abortion. It can cause severe losses to the animal husbandry, and the overall epidemic situation of yak's BVDV in China is unclear. Meta-analysis can reveal the basic epidemic situation of BVDV in different yak distribution areas in China, and estimate potentially related factors, to pave the way for clarifying the epidemic situation of yak in the domestic scope. METHODS: We proceeded to a systematic review and meta-analysis of data from papers on the BVDV incidence and prevalence in yaks in China by searching PubMed, ScienceDirect, Chinese Web of Knowledge (CNKI), Wanfang, and Chongqing VIP for publication from 1987 to 2019. We excluded reviews and duplicate studies, 24 studies denouncing the prevalence of BVDV in yak in China were selected upon our inclusion criterion finally. We estimated the pooled prevalence of BVDV infection in yaks by a random-effects model and evaluated its overall infection burden in China. FINDINGS: In total, the pooled prevalence of BVDV in yaks in China was 36.0\% (95\% CI 25.6\%-46.4\%) based on the data obtained from 13,446 yaks, by detecting antigens and antibodies. The highest BVDV positive rate in yak reached 67.5\% in Xinjiang province of China. The prevalence in the six provinces of China was validated to be quite variable (24.4\%-67.5\%) and reached 369\% in yaks of northwest China. Besides, the BVDV antigen-positive rate was estimated at 13.8\% (95\% CI 8.6\%-19.0\%) based on 5 studies, comparatively, the pooled BVDV antibody-based on 18 studies was about 32.9\% (95\% CI 24.6\%-41.2\%) in China. INTERPRETATION: This systematic review and meta-analysis firstly established an estimated prevalence of BVDV in yaks in China, as a whole, and estimates potential relevant factors, including geographic location, publication year, age, detection methods, etc., Our findings suggest that the scientific community or decision-makers can formulate corresponding prevention and control plans based on potential risk factors.},

However, their overall efficacy remains uncertain; therefore, the identification of evidence-based management recommendations to manipulate anestrous in goats is important. Electronic databases were searched to retrieve reports on studies using interventions based on hormonal, sociosexual, nutritional, and abiotic factors. Only experimental studies in which a group of anestrous does was treated and compared against an untreated group were included. Estrus, ovulation, and pregnancy were primary outcomes, whereas the onset of estrus after treatment, the ovulation rate, and the number of anovulatory days were secondary outcomes. Odds ratio (OR) and mean differences were used to synthesize pooled data, and random effects models were used to calculate them. Seventy studies involving 3974 goats met the inclusion criteria. Unclear risk of bias for random sequence generation and allocation concealment predominated across studies. Pooled data for hormonal, sociosexual, and abiotic interventions showed a significant, though variable, increase in estrus (OR range 7.15-144.80), ovulation (OR range 6.08-56.95), and pregnancy (OR range 3.94-30.8). Hormonal treatments significantly reduced the onset of estrus, whereas abiotic interventions failed to reduce the number of anovulatory days. Secondary outcomes were not assessed in trials using sociosexual approaches. Finally, except for pregnancy, no significant efficacy was observed for studies using nutritional management. In conclusion, reproductive management practices using sociosexual approaches showed the highest efficacy for restoring reproductive activity in anestrous does.},

Dromedary vaccine candidates in the development pipeline are showing hopeful results, but gaps in our understanding of the epidemiology of MERS-CoV in dromedaries must be addressed to design and evaluate potential vaccination strategies. We aim to bring together existing measures of MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels to assess the distribution of infection, highlighting knowledge gaps and implications for animal vaccination. We systematically reviewed the published literature on MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science that reported seroprevalence and/or prevalence of active MERS-CoV infection in dromedary camels from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. 60 studies met our eligibility criteria. Qualitative syntheses determined that MERS-CoV seroprevalence increased with age up to 80-100\% in adult dromedaries supporting geographically widespread endemicity of MERS-CoV in dromedaries in both the Arabian Peninsula and countries exporting dromedaries from Africa. The high prevalence of active infection measured in juveniles and at sites where dromedary populations mix should guide further investigation - particularly of dromedary movement - and inform vaccination strategy design and evaluation through mathematical modelling.},

	abstract = {There is increased demand for dairy products worldwide, which is coupled with the realization that consumers want dairy products that are produced in a sustainable and environmentally benign manner. Forage legumes, and white clover (Trifolium repens L.; WC) in particular, have the potential to positively influence the sustainability of pasture-based ruminant production systems. Therefore, there is increased interest in the use of forage legumes because they offer opportunities for sustainable pasture-based production systems. A meta-analysis was undertaken to quantify the milk production response associated with the introduction of WC into perennial ryegrass swards and to investigate the optimal WC content of dairy pastures to increase milk production. Two separate databases were created. In the grass-WC database, papers were selected if they compared milk production of lactating dairy cows grazing perennial ryegrass-WC (GC) swards with that of cows grazing perennial ryegrass-only swards (GO). In the WC-only database, papers were selected if they contained milk production from lactating dairy cows grazing on GC swards with varying levels of WC content. Data from both databases were analyzed using mixed models (PROC MIXED) in SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Within the grass-WC database, where mean sward WC content was 31.6\%, mean daily milk and milk solids yield per cow were increased by 1.4 and 0.12 kg, respectively, whereas milk and milk solids yield per hectare were unaffected when cows grazed GC compared with GO swards. Stocking rate and nitrogen fertilizer application were reduced by 0.25 cows/ha and 81 kg/ha, respectively, on GC swards compared with GO swards. These results highlight the potential of GC production systems to achieve similar levels of production to GO systems but with reduced fertilizer nitrogen inputs, which is beneficial from both an economic and environmental point of view. In the context of increased demand for dairy products, there may be potential to increase the productivity of GC systems by increasing fertilizer nitrogen use to increase stocking rate and carrying capacity while also retaining the benefit of WC inclusion on milk production per cow.},

The goal of this review was to evaluate studies about AAI and its effects on oncological/palliative care patients. METHODS: The search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus and Lilacs databases. The inclusion criteria were original articles that measured quantitatively the health-related outcomes of an AAI on oncological/palliative care patients. RESULTS: Ten studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Benefits related to the AAI were described. Mood, pain perception and quality of life seemed to be the variables that had improvement with the intervention. Due to the small sample sizes/heterogeneous methodologies, additional analyses could not be performed. CONCLUSIONS: AAI can be an important tool for improving psychosocial/physiological parameters in cancer/palliative care patients. Further well designed studies are needed to provide a better knowledge of the AAI benefits in this setting.},

	abstract = {A key aspect of the systematic review process is study evaluation to understand the strengths and weaknesses of individual studies included in the review. The present manuscript describes the process currently being used by the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) Program to evaluate animal toxicity studies, illustrated by application to the recent systematic reviews of two phthalates: diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP) and diethyl phthalate (DEP). The IRIS Program uses a domain-based approach that was developed after careful consideration of tools used by others to evaluate experimental animal studies in toxicology and pre-clinical research. Standard practice is to have studies evaluated by at least two independent reviewers for aspects related to reporting quality, risk of bias/internal validity (e.g., randomization, blinding at outcome assessment, methods used to expose animals and assess outcomes, etc.), and sensitivity to identify factors that may limit the ability of a study to detect a true effect. To promote consistency across raters, prompting considerations and example responses are provided to reviewers, and a pilot phase is conducted. The evaluation process is performed separately for each outcome reported in a study, as the utility of a study may vary for different outcomes. Input from subject matter experts is used to identify chemical- and outcome-specific considerations (e.g., lifestage of exposure and outcome assessment when considering reproductive effects) to guide judgments within particular evaluation domains. For each evaluation domain, reviewers reach a consensus on a rating of Good, Adequate, Deficient, or Critically Deficient. These individual domain ratings are then used to determine the overall confidence in the study (High Confidence, Medium Confidence, Low Confidence, or Deficient). Study evaluation results, including the justifications for reviewer judgements, are documented and made publicly available in EPA's version of Health Assessment Workspace Collaborative (HAWC), a free and open source web-based software application.

	abstract = {Brazil is a global agricultural commodity producer and the largest consumer of pesticides. Pesticide use in Brazil comprised 549 280 tons in 2018. In the country, soybean, corn, and sugar cane are extensively produced, which are the most pesticides demanding crops. In the last years, the records of new pesticides were the highest in the historical series. They can persist in soil or water, accumulate in organisms, and contaminate workers and the general population through the air, water, or food. This review aimed to gather toxicological data obtained by animal models exposed to 4 pesticides: glyphosate, chlorpyrifos, abamectin, and 2,4-D. An additional goal was to compose an overview of how this subject has been approached, surveying which research groups are working on this field, where they are located, and relations with pesticides used in those regions. We collected the papers from the platforms PubMed, Scopus, Scielo, and Web of Science, performed in Brazil from 2014 to 2019. After two-step blind selection using the software Rayyan QCRI by different authors, 67 studies were selected to extract data. We observed that research is more concentrated in the South region, followed by the Southeast and Midwest, with 43\%, 32\%, and 23\% of the studies, respectively. The prevalent institutions are from the states of Rio Grande do Sul, São Paulo, and Goiás. The effects on a variety of biomarkers help predict the potential risks to humans and nontarget organisms. The prevalent animal model was fish (36\%). Overall, the main toxic effects evaluated were mortality, abnormalities in the blood cells, developmental abnormalities, and behavior alterations.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The cestode Taenia solium causes the neglected (zoonotic) tropical disease cysticercosis, a leading cause of preventable epilepsy in endemic low and middle-income countries. Transmission models can inform current scaling-up of control efforts by helping to identify, validate and optimise control and elimination strategies as proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A systematic literature search was conducted using the PRISMA approach to identify and compare existing T. solium transmission models, and related Taeniidae infection transmission models. In total, 28 modelling papers were identified, of which four modelled T. solium exclusively. Different modelling approaches for T. solium included deterministic, Reed-Frost, individual-based, decision-tree, and conceptual frameworks. Simulated interventions across models agreed on the importance of coverage for impactful effectiveness to be achieved. Other Taeniidae infection transmission models comprised force-of-infection (FoI), population-based (mainly Echinococcus granulosus) and individual-based (mainly E. multilocularis) modelling approaches. Spatial structure has also been incorporated (E. multilocularis and Taenia ovis) in recognition of spatial aggregation of parasite eggs in the environment and movement of wild animal host populations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Gaps identified from examining the wider Taeniidae family models highlighted the potential role of FoI modelling to inform model parameterisation, as well as the need for spatial modelling and suitable structuring of interventions as key areas for future T. solium model development. We conclude that working with field partners to address data gaps and conducting cross-model validation with baseline and longitudinal data will be critical to building consensus-led and epidemiological setting-appropriate intervention strategies to help fulfil the WHO targets.},

Many studies on vaccination have been performed previously, and micronemal proteins (MICs) have crucial importance in this regard. The current review aims to reveal the efficiency of MICs as target antigen, adjuvants, animal models (species/strain), T. gondii strains for challenge infection, and routes of vaccine to prevent Toxoplasma infection. A comprehensive literature search was performed on April 18, 2018, in several known databases. Studies were included when evaluating vaccines based on MIC against T. gondii compared to that of a control group. Two independent researchers done the search process, study choice, and data extraction. A total of 28 articles published were selected for further analysis. Among them, 57.03\% of the studies focused on MIC3 and its epitopes. SAG1 was further used in cocktail vaccines compared to other antigens. GM-CSF and Freund's complete were the predominant adjuvants used. BALB/c mice have been introduced as a proper model for lethal challenge. Virulent T. gondii (RH) was utilized more than other strains for challenge. Among MICs, the results of vaccination with MIC1-4, MIC6, and PLP1 demonstrated significantly strong humoral and cellular immunity, increased survival time, and reduced cyst burden in the mice. This review summarizes the latest results on MIC-based vaccines and presents that the most effective vaccination procedure is the administration of the cocktail vaccines. Our survey can serve as a basis for further studies to develop more efficient novel vaccines against T. gondii for animals and humans.},

Recently, the World Health Organization has included Iran in a list of 6 countries known to have serious problems with fascioliasis. In addition, cercarial dermatitis is a job-related disease that is seen often in paddy workers, agricultural labourers, and fishermen in Iran, particularly in Mazandaran Province. Many studies have been conducted in Iran to survey larval trematodes in freshwater snails. However, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive data exist regarding infections in gastropods. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to estimate the types and prevalence of cercarial infections in snails in Iran. Electronic English-language and Persian-language databases were searched to identify 24 published articles reporting the prevalence of trematode infections in snails (9 species from 6 families) in various provinces of Iran. In total, 4.4\% of gastropods were infected with the larval stages of trematodes. According to the studies reviewed in this meta-analysis' the highest infection prevalence was found in Radix auricularia (9.9\%). Twelve larval species of trematodes were identified, and the highest prevalence of cercariae was found for Echinostomatidae cercariae (4.3\%). Among the provinces explored, West Azerbaijan had the highest prevalence of infected snails (16.9\%). The presence of trematodes in snails could pose a serious health problem in Iran. Thus, further studies are necessary to characterize these infections in other provinces.},

	abstract = {Quality of life (QoL) is an important parameter to assess in cats, as it can be pivotal to important decision-making. Research reports that owners of cats with heart disease would trade longevity for QoL, and treatment associated improvement in QoL is very important for cats with chronic kidney disease. This systematic review aimed to explore the published literature to identify the number and range of QoL assessment tools available to researchers and veterinary professionals, by discovering tools which have already been used in published studies. Medline and CAB Abstracts were searched in March 2018, using terms relevant to cats and QoL or well-being. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied and information on uniqueness, validation and a short description of each tool extracted. A total of 1138 manuscripts were identified, of which 96 met all criteria. Forty of 96 manuscripts contained an assessment of QoL, using one of 32 unique tools identified. Sixteen of the tools identified were structured, making detailed patient assessments. Only eight of the structured tools were validated, and of these, three could be applied to healthy cats; the remainder being specific to a disease or being hospitalised. Some validated tools appeared in more than one manuscript. Overall, 12 manuscripts used a validated tool. In the 16 unstructured tools, five tools assessed QoL by assigning a single word (e.g. 'poor'). Eight tools assessed QoL on a single Likert scale (e.g. a number between 1 and 5). This work identifies the tools that are currently available for the assessment of QoL by researchers and veterinary professionals. Additionally, it demonstrates that many are not validated or lack detailed animal assessment, highlighting that further work in this important area is needed.},

We searched articles published in indexed journals using the keywords: "Mycobacterium bovis," "wild," and "animals". After applying the keywords using online databases, during March and August of 2018, we found 12 articles which encompassed 15 species of wild animals, of which three consisted of wild ruminants. The evidence showed that M. bovis is present among the wild animals in the Americas. The methodological limitations for diagnosing M. bovis in wild animals are many, demanding the development of new and more precise tools. Furthermore, new researches are needed to elucidate the role of the wild animals in the epidemiology of M. bovis and its possible impact on production animals and public health.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence of analgesic efficacy of tramadol for the management of postoperative pain and the presence of associated adverse events in dogs. DATABASES USED: A comprehensive search using PubMed/MEDLINE, LILACS, Google Scholar and CAB databases with no restrictions on language and following a prespecified protocol was performed from June 2019 to July 2020. Included were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) performed in dogs that had undergone general anesthesia for any type of surgery. Two authors independently classified the studies, extracted data and assessed their risk of bias using Cochrane's tool. RevMan and GRADE methods were used to rate the certainty of evidence (CoE). CONCLUSIONS: Overall 26 RCTs involving 848 dogs were included. Tramadol administration probably results in a lower need for rescue analgesia versus no treatment or placebo [moderate CoE; relative risk (RR): 0.47; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.26-0.85; I(2) = 0\%], and may result in a lower need for rescue analgesia versus buprenorphine (low CoE; RR: 0.50; 95\% CI: 0.20-1.24), codeine (low CoE; RR: 0.75; 95\% CI: 0.16-3.41) and nalbuphine (low CoE; RR: 0.05; 95\% CI: 0.00-0.72). However, tramadol administration may result in an increased requirement for rescue analgesia versus methadone (low CoE; RR: 3.45; 95\% CI: 0.66-18.08; I(2) = 43\%) and COX inhibitors (low CoE; RR: 2.27; 95\% CI: 0.68-7.60; I(2) = 45\%). Compared with multimodal therapy, tramadol administration may make minimal to no difference in the requirement for rescue analgesia (low CoE; RR: 1.12; 95\% CI: 0.48-2.60; I(2) = 0\%). Adverse events were inconsistently reported and the CoE was very low. The overall CoE of the analgesic efficacy of tramadol for postoperative pain management in dogs was low or very low, and the main reasons for downgrading the evidence were risk of bias and imprecision.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Canine parvovirus 2 (CPV-2) is a pathogenic virus that infects dogs, causing a highly infectious disease. Monitoring CPV-2 spread is an important part of prevention; however, the prevalence and epidemiological characteristics of CPV-2 have not been systematically evaluated and analyzed in mainland China. Therefore, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to assess prevalence and epidemiological characteristics of CPV-2 in domestic dogs in mainland China. METHODS: In this study, Chinese and English literature on CPV-2 epidemiology published between January 2006 and December 2019 was evaluated. Regarding meta-analysis, the random-effect model was employed by forest plot with 95\% of confidence interval. The number of CPV-2 infections was identified and the pooled prevalence of infection, as well as the epidemiological characteristics, was calculated using meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 39 studies (data from 137,844 dogs) met the evaluation criteria and were used in our study. The pooled prevalence of CPV-2 infection in mainland China was 36\%. CPV-2 infection were associated with age, breed, sampling season and immunization status, but not with gender, publication time and diagnostic methods. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that CPV-2 is prevalent among dogs in China. It is therefore necessary to carry out continuous surveillance and epidemiological studies of CPV-2. In addition, accordingly, effective measures should be taken to prevent the transmission and spread of CPV-2 among the Chinese dog population.},

A SR of experimental developmental animal PBDE-mediated neurotoxicity studies was performed in the present study. Outcomes assessed included measures related to learning, memory, and attention, which parallel the intelligence-related outcomes evaluated in the human studies SR. PubMed, Embase, and Toxline were searched for relevant experimental non-human mammalian studies. Evaluation of risk of bias (RoB) and overall body of evidence followed guidance developed by the National Toxicology Program. Animal studies using varying designs and outcomes were available for BDEs 47, 99, 153, 203, 206, and 209 and the technical mixture DE-71. Study reporting of methods and results was often incomplete leading to concerns regarding RoB. A meta-analysis of 6 Morris water maze studies showed evidence of a significant increase in last trial latency (effect size of 25.8 [CI, 20.3 to 31.2]) in PBDE-exposed animals with low heterogeneity. For most endpoints, there were unexplained inconsistencies across studies and no consistent evidence of a dose-response relationship. There is a "moderate" level of evidence that exposure to BDEs 47, 99, and 209 affects learning. For other PBDEs and other endpoints, the level of evidence was "low" or "very low". The meta-analysis led to stronger conclusions than that based upon a qualitative review of the evidence. The SR also identified RoB concerns that might be remedied by better study reporting.},

The aim of this investigation was to conduct systematic reviews of human and animal evidence of the effect of in utero exposure to diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) on anogenital distance (AGD) in males. PubMed, Embase, and Toxline were searched for relevant human and experimental animal studies on August 15, 2016. Search results were screened for relevance, and studies that met the inclusion criteria were evaluated for quality and data extracted for analysis. Confidence in the human and animal bodies of evidence was assessed and hazard conclusions reached by integrating evidence streams. The search yielded 6 relevant human studies and 19 animal studies. Meta-analysis of 5 human observational prospective cohort studies showed that increased maternal urinary concentrations of DEHP metabolites were associated with decreased AGD in boys (-4.07 [CI, -6.49 to -1.66] \% decrease per log(10) rise in DEHP metabolites). Meta-analysis and meta-regression of the 19 experimental animal studies found reduced AGD with DEHP treatment, with a dose-response gradient, and with heterogeneity explained by species and strain. There is a moderate level of evidence from human investigations and a high level of data from animal studies that in utero exposure to DEHP decreases AGD. Based upon the available human and animal evidence, and consideration of mechanistic data, DEHP is presumed to be a reproductive hazard to humans on the basis of effects on AGD.},

	abstract = {In the past decade, several conceptual papers have linked variation in animal personality to variation in cognition, and recent years have seen a flood of empirical studies testing this link. However, these results have not been synthesized in a quantitative way. Here, we systematically search the literature and conduct a phylogenetically controlled meta-analysis of empirical papers that have tested the relationship between animal personality (exploration, boldness, activity, aggression and sociability) and cognition (initial learning/reversal speed, number of correct choices/errors after standard training). We find evidence for a small but significant relationship between variation in personality and variation in learning across species in the absolute scale; however, the direction of this relationship is highly variable and when both positive and negative effect sizes are considered, the average effect size does not differ significantly from zero. Importantly, this variation among studies is not explained by differences in personality or learning measure, or taxonomic grouping. Further, these results do not support current hypotheses suggesting that that fast-explorers are fast-learners or that slow-explorers perform better on tests of reversal learning. Rather, we find evidence that bold animals are faster learners, but only when boldness is measured in response to a predator (or simulated predator) and not when boldness is measured by exposure to a novel object (or novel food). Further, although only a small sub-sample of papers reported results separately for males and females, sex explained a significant amount of variation in effect size. These results, therefore, suggest that, while personality and learning are indeed related across a range of species, the direction of this relationship is highly variable. Thus further empirical work is needed to determine whether there are important moderators of this relationship.This article is part of the theme issue 'Causes and consequences of individual differences in cognitive abilities'.},

Currently, in preclinical research, new stimulation parameters are being investigated to achieve better and longer effects. This systematic review summarizes the status of SNM stimulation parameters and its effect on urinary tract and bowel dysfunction in preclinical research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The literature search was conducted using three databases: Ovid (Medline, Embase) and PubMed. Articles were included if they reported on stimulation parameters in animal studies for lower urinary tract or bowel dysfunction as a primary outcome. Methodological quality assessment was performed using the SYRCLE Risk of Bias (RoB) tool for animal studies. RESULTS: Twenty-two articles were eligible for this systematic review and various aspects of stimulation parameters were included: frequency, intensity, pulse width, stimulation signal, timing of stimulation, and unilateral vs. bilateral stimulation. In general, all experimental studies reported an acute effect of SNM on urinary tract or bowel dysfunction, whereas at the same time, various stimulation settings were used. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this systematic review indicate that SNM has a positive therapeutic effect on lower urinary tract and bowel dysfunction. Using low-frequency-SNM, high-frequency-SNM, bilateral SNM, and higher pulse widths showed beneficial effects on storage and evacuation dysfunction in animal studies. An increased variability of stimulation parameters may serve as a basis for future improvement of the effect of SNM in patients suffering from urinary tract or bowel dysfunction.},

In a systematic review, 190 studies of tests for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle (published 1934-2009) were assessed by at least one of 18 reviewers using the QUADAS (Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) checklist adapted for animal disease tests. VETQUADAS (VQ) included items measuring clarity in reporting (n = 3), internal validity (n = 9) and external validity (n = 2). A similar pattern for compliance was observed in studies of different diagnostic test types. Compliance significantly improved with year of publication for all items measuring clarity in reporting and external validity but only improved in four of the nine items measuring internal validity (p {\textless} 0.05). 107 references, of which 83 had performance data eligible for inclusion in a meta-analysis were reviewed by two reviewers. In these references, agreement between reviewers' responses was 71\% for compliance, 32\% for unsure and 29\% for non-compliance. Mean compliance with reporting items was 2, 5.2 for internal validity and 1.5 for external validity. The index test result was described in sufficient detail in 80.1\% of studies and was interpreted without knowledge of the reference standard test result in only 33.1\%. Loss to follow-up was adequately explained in only 31.1\% of studies. The prevalence of deficiencies observed may be due to inadequate reporting but may also reflect lack of attention to methodological issues that could bias the results of diagnostic test performance estimates. QUADAS was a useful tool for assessing and comparing the quality of studies measuring the performance of diagnostic tests but might be improved further by including explicit assessment of population sampling strategy.},

References that complied with stage 1 selection criteria were reviewed in entirety and agreed data were extracted from references that complied with stage 2 selection criteria. At stage 1, 9782 references were reviewed and 261 (2.6\%) passed through to stage 2 where 215 English language references were each randomly allocated to two of 18 WG reviewers and 46 references in other languages were allocated to native speakers. Agreement regarding eligibility between reviewers of the same reference at stage 2 was moderate (Kappa statistic = 0.51) and a resolution procedure was conducted. Only 119 references (published 1934-2009) were identified with eligible performance estimates for one or more of 14 different diagnostic test types; despite a comprehensive search strategy and the global impact of bTB. Searches of electronic databases for diagnostic test performance data were found to be nonspecific with regard to identifying references with diagnostic test Se or Sp data. Guidelines for the content of abstracts to research papers reporting diagnostic test performance are presented. The results of meta-analyses of the sensitivity and specificity of the tests, and of an evaluation of the methodological quality of the source references, are presented in accompanying papers (Nuñez-Garcia et al., 2017; Downs et al., 2017).},

	volume = {15},
	issn = {1932-6203},
	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0230038},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a rapid development in technologies that generate weak static magnetic fields (SMF) including high-voltage direct current (HVDC) lines, systems operating with batteries, such as electric cars, and devices using permanent magnets. However, few reviews on the effects of such fields on biological systems have been prepared and none of these evaluations have had a particular focus on weak SMF (≤ 1 mT). The aim of this review was to systematically analyze and evaluate possible effects of weak SMF (≤ 1 mT) on biological functioning and to provide an update on the current state of research. METHODS: This review was prepared in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. Methodological limitations in individual studies were assessed using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) Risk-of-Bias Rating Tool. RESULTS: Eleven studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. All included studies were experimental animal studies as no human studies were among the eligible articles. Eight of the eleven studies reported responses of rat, rabbits and quails to weak SMF exposure that were expressed as altered melatonin biosynthesis, reduced locomotor activity, altered vasomotion and blood pressure, transient changes in blood pressure-related biochemical parameters, or in the level of neurotransmitters and increases in enzyme activities. It remained largely unclear from the interpretation of the results whether the reported effects in the evaluated studies were beneficial or detrimental for health. CONCLUSION: The available evidence from the literature reviewed is not sufficient to draw a conclusion for biological and health-related effects of exposure to weak SMF. There was a lack of homogeneity regarding the exposed biological systems and the examined endpoints as well as a lack of scientific rigor in most reviewed studies which lowered credibility in the reported results. We therefore encourage further and more systematic research in this area. Any new studies should particularly address effects of exposure to SMF on biological functioning in humans to evaluate whether SMF pose a risk to human health.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Amphenicols have been widely used in the pig industry in China, leading to varying degrees of drug resistance. METHODS: The systematic review was performed according to PRISMA (Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) recommendations on studies investigating the prevalence of amphenicol-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) isolated from pig in mainland China from 2000 to 2018, a random-effects model was selected, then followed by meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 103 articles were included in the study. The results of the meta-analysis revealed that the pooled summarized prevalence of resistance to chloramphenicol (CAP) was 72.31\% (95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) = 67.12\%-77.23\%) and to florfenicol (FF) was 58.64\% (95\% CI = 52.48\%-64.67\%). During the past 18 years, the resistance rate to CAP remained high initially but then declined rapidly after 2012, whereas the resistance rate to FF plateaued (54.13\%-59.60\%) from 2000-2018. In different parts of China, the rate of resistance to amphenicols among E. coli isolates was fairly consistent, with the exception of the north and northwest regions. CONCLUSIONS: In 2002, the veterinary use of CAP was prohibited and its resistance levels in E. coli isolated from pigs was initially maintained at a high level but then showed an obvious downward trend in recent years. Resistance to commonly used FF remained at a high but stable level.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is some concern that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may impair the healing of certain musculoskeletal tissues. However, the effect of NSAIDs on the specialized fibrocartilaginous transition at the tendon-to-bone interface remains largely unknown. Thus, the purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of NSAIDs on tendon-to-bone healing following acute injury or surgery. METHODS: A systematic review was performed according to the 2009 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL), and SportDiscus databases were searched from the time of database inception to May 14, 2018 to identify all clinical and basic science studies investigating the effect of NSAIDs on tendon-to-bone healing. Methodological quality was assessed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) and SYstematic Review Center for Laboratory animal Research (SYRCLE) risk of bias assessment tools for clinical and basic science studies, respectively. A qualitative synthesis of the literature was performed with a subgroup meta-analysis of homogeneous basic science studies. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies, including three clinical and 10 basic science studies, were included. The overall methodological quality of the included clinical studies was poor, while assessment of the basic science studies revealed consistent areas at high or unclear risk of bias. Of the included clinical studies, a single study reported a higher rate of rotator cuff repair failure with selective (COX-2) NSAID use compared with non-selective NSAID use, while no clinical failures were noted with NSAID use following distal biceps tendon repair. Basic science studies had heterogeneous outcome reporting. A subgroup analysis of homogeneous animal studies revealed no significant effect of all NSAIDs (Standard Mean Difference [SMD] -1.05, 95\% Confidence Interval [CI] -2.39-0.30, p=0.13) or non-selective NSAIDs on load to failure (SMD -0.62, 95\% CI -1.26-0.02, p=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: The current literature does not provide sufficient evidence for or against the use of NSAIDs following acute injury or surgical repair of the tendon-bone interface.Level of Evidence: IV.},

Such approaches would be of interest not only for organic but also for conventional dairy producers. The objective of the current review was to quantify the effect of non-antimicrobial internal teat sealant (ITS)-based approaches at drying-off for treating and preventing IMI, when compared with no treatment or with an antimicrobial-based approach. The protocol for this review was published before initiating the review. A total of 18 trials from 16 articles could be used to investigate the effect of an ITS-based approach. With the available results, we conclude with a high level of confidence that non-antimicrobial ITS-based dry-off approaches are efficient for preventing new IMI during the dry period when compared with no treatment, and would reduce risk of new IMI by 52\%. Moreover, we are relatively confident that a bismuth subnitrate-based ITS performed better than an antimicrobial for preventing new IMI during the dry period (a risk reduction of 23\%). Similarly, we are relatively confident that an ITS-based approach would only slightly or not at all reduce the prevalence of IMI at calving compared with untreated quarters.},

This literature review aims to identify workplace-based assessment tools that indicate progression toward unsupervised practice, suitable for entrustment decisions and feedback to learners. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in the PubMed, Embase, ERIC, and PsycINFO databases. Based on title/abstract and full text, articles were selected using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Information on workplace-based assessment tools was extracted using data coding sheets. The methodological quality of studies was assessed using the medical education research study quality instrument (MERSQI). RESULTS: The search yielded 6,371 articles (180 were evaluated in full text). In total, 80 articles were included, identifying 67 assessment tools. Only a few studies explicitly mentioned assessment tools used as a resource for entrustment decisions. Validity evidence was frequently reported, and the MERSQI score was 10.0 on average. CONCLUSIONS: Many workplace-based assessment tools were identified that potentially support learners with feedback on their development and support supervisors with providing feedback. As expected, only few articles referred to entrustment decisions. Nevertheless, the existing tools or the principals could be used for entrustment decisions, supervision level, or autonomy.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent deadly outbreaks of Marburg virus underscore the need for an effective vaccine. A summary of the latest research is needed for this WHO priority pathogen. This systematic review aimed to determine progress towards a vaccine for Marburg virus. METHODS: Article search criteria were developed to query PubMed for peer-reviewed articles from 1990 through 2019 on Marburg virus vaccine clinical trials in humans and pre-clinical studies in non-human primates (NHP). Abstracts were reviewed by two authors. Relevant articles were reviewed in full. Discrepancies were resolved by a third author. Data abstracted included year, author, title, vaccine construct, number of subjects, efficacy, and demographics. Assessment for risk of bias was performed using the Syrcle tool for animal studies, and the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool for human studies. RESULTS: 101 articles were identified; 27 were related to Marburg vaccines. After full text review, 21 articles were selected. 215 human subjects were in three phase 1 clinical trials, and 203 NHP in 18 studies. Vaccine constructs were DNA plasmids, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vectors, adenovirus vectors, virus-like particles (VLP), among others. Two human phase 1 studies of DNA vaccines had 4 adverse effects requiring vaccine discontinuation among 128 participants and 31-80\% immunogenicity. In NHP challenge studies, 100\% survival was seen in 6 VSV vectored vaccines, 2 DNA vaccines, 2 VLP vaccines, and in 1 adenoviral vectored vaccine. CONCLUSION: In human trials, two Marburg DNA vaccines provided either low immunogenicity or a failure to elicit durable immunity. A variety of NHP candidate Marburg vaccines demonstrated favorable survival and immunogenicity parameters, to include VSV, VLP, and adenoviral vectored vaccines. Elevated binding antibodies appeared to be consistently associated with protection across the NHP challenge studies. Further human trials are needed to advance vaccines to limit the spread of this highly lethal virus.},

	abstract = {The use of pressure via a bit in the horse's mouth is part of training methods throughout equine disciplines. Rein tension refers to the force exerted on the reins between the horse and human during ridden and in-hand training. Understanding the effects of these forces has the potential to inform both rider performance and equine welfare research. The methodological protocols of current rein tension research appear inconsistent, and to date, a review on rein tension has not been published. This study uses a systematic literature review to evaluate the tools and methods used to measure rein tension within current literature to establish whether their findings were reliable. The review also suggests improvements to study protocols, where appropriate, to enable the standardized measurement of rein tension. A search protocol was developed and inclusion criteria defined with the aid of independent subject specialists, including 2 published equestrian authors, an equine industry professional and a librarian. Inclusion criteria determined that only full peer-reviewed articles available via Google Scholar and published in the previous 15 years were included in the review. Articles also had to include the following key words: rein tension AND "horse/s" OR "rider/s" OR "equine/s" OR "equestrian." The literature search returned 154 initial results, and the inclusion criteria rejected 137 results. Seventeen primary research articles (after 2002) from peer-reviewed journals were subsequently reviewed. The articles reviewed found rein tension to be influenced by the horse, the rider, and the training equipment used. Rein tension studies have multivariable foci and methodological limitations and frequently report their methods and results inconsistently. Future rein tension research should aim to improve the consistency of reporting horse-related, rider-related, and performance-related factors that may affect rein tension, as well as reporting data handling and analysis approaches to increase comparability between studies.},

A total of 160 titles and abstracts were identified, and 29 publications met the inclusion criteria, 14 in vitro and 15 in vivo studies.

Preclinical studies described improvement of bone and periodontal healing with the association of adipose-derived cells and the carrier materials tested: Platelet Rich Plasma, Fibrin, Collagen and Synthetic polymer. There is evidence from the current in vitro and in vivo data indicating that adipose-derived cells may contribute to bone and periodontal regeneration. The small quantity of studies and the large variation on study designs, from animal models, cell sources and defect morphology, did not favor a meta-analysis. Additional studies need to be conducted to investigate the regeneration variability and the mechanisms of cell participation in the processes.

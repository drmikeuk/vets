A systematic search was conducted within CINAHL, Web of Science CAB Abstracts, PubMed, Abstracts in Social Gerontology, Google Scholar, and PsycINFO for primary research articles. A total of 32 studies were included in the final review. Variation was noted in study designs and in study setting. Twenty-seven of 32 studies used dogs as the intervention. Agitation/aggression showed a significant decrease in nine of 15 studies. Eleven of 12 studies demonstrated increased social interaction with AAI. Mood had mixed results in nine studies. Quality of life was increased in three of four studies. Resident activity and nutritional intake were each increased in two studies. Animal assisted activities/interventions showed a strong positive effect on social behaviors, physical activity, and dietary intake in dementia patients and a positive effect on agitation/aggression and quality of life.},

	abstract = {Progesterone is a critical hormone during early pregnancy in the cow. As a result, a number of studies have investigated the effects of progesterone supplementation on pregnancy rates. In this study, a meta-analysis using a univariate binary random effects model was carried out on 84 specific treatments reported in 53 publications involving control (n = 9905) and progesterone-treated (n = 9135) cows. Although the results of individual studies showed wide variations (-40\% to +50\% point changes), progesterone treatment resulted in an overall increase in pregnancy rate odds ratio (OR = 1.12; P {\textless} 0.01). Improvements in pregnancy rate were only observed in cows treated at natural estrus (OR = 1.41, P {\textless} 0.01) and not following synchronization of estrus or ovulation. Although treatment between Days 3 to 7 postinsemination was beneficial (OR = 1.15; P {\textless} 0.01), treatment earlier or later than this was not. Progesterone supplementation was beneficial in cows of lower fertility ({\textless}45\% control pregnancy rate) but not in cows with higher fertility. These results indicated that the benefit of progesterone supplementation on fertility of cows required exogenous progesterone supplementation to start between Day 3 to 7 and the appropriate reproductive status (i.e., lower fertility, natural estrus) of the treated cows.},

Campylobacter isolates from conventional retail chicken were more likely to be ciprofloxacin-resistant (odds ratio 9.62, 95\% confidence interval 5.67-16.35). Bacteria isolated from conventional animal production exhibited a higher prevalence of resistance to antimicrobials; however, the recovery of some resistant strains was also identified in organic animal production, where there is an apparent reduced antimicrobial selection pressure. Limited or inconsistent research was identified in studies examining the prevalence of zoonotic and potentially zoonotic bacteria in other food-animal species.

	abstract = {Knowledge synthesis refers to the integration of findings from individual research studies on a given topic or question into the global knowledge base. The application of knowledge synthesis methods, particularly systematic reviews and meta-analysis, has increased considerably in the agri-food public health sector over the past decade and this trend is expected to continue. The objectives of our review were: (1) to describe the most promising knowledge synthesis methods and their applicability in agri-food public health, and (2) to summarize the recent advancements, challenges, and opportunities in the use of systematic review and meta-analysis methods in this sector. We performed a structured review of knowledge synthesis literature from various disciplines to address the first objective, and used comprehensive insights and experiences in applying these methods in the agri-food public health sector to inform the second objective. We describe five knowledge synthesis methods that can be used to address various agri-food public health questions or topics under different conditions and contexts. Scoping reviews describe the main characteristics and knowledge gaps in a broad research field and can be used to evaluate opportunities for prioritizing focused questions for related systematic reviews. Structured rapid reviews are streamlined systematic reviews conducted within a short timeframe to inform urgent decision-making. Mixed-method and qualitative reviews synthesize diverse sources of contextual knowledge (e.g. socio-cognitive, economic, and feasibility considerations). Systematic reviews are a structured and transparent method used to summarize and synthesize literature on a clearly-defined question, and meta-analysis is the statistical combination of data from multiple individual studies. We briefly describe and discuss key advancements in the use of systematic reviews and meta-analysis, including: risk-of-bias assessments; an overall quality-of-evidence approach; engagement of stakeholders; Bayesian, multivariate, and network meta-analysis; and synthesis of diagnostic test accuracy studies. We also highlight several challenges and opportunities in the conduct of systematic reviews (e.g. inclusion of grey literature, minimizing language bias, and optimizing search strategies) and meta-analysis (e.g. inclusion of observational studies and approaches to address the insufficient reporting of data and significant heterogeneity). Many of these developments have yet to be comprehensively applied and evaluated in an agri-food public health context, and more research is needed in this area. There is a need to strengthen knowledge synthesis capacity and infrastructure at the regional, national, and international levels in this sector to ensure that the best available knowledge is used to inform future decision-making about agri-food public health issues.},

	abstract = {Pork is one of the major food sources of human salmonellosis worldwide, while beef products have been implicated in numerous foodborne outbreaks. As a result, effective interventions to reduce Salmonella contamination during beef and pork processing are of interest to both regulators and industry. We conducted a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis of literature investigating the efficacy of slaughter and processing interventions to control Salmonella in beef and pork. Review steps included: a comprehensive search strategy; relevance screening of abstracts; relevance confirmation of articles; data extraction; risk-of-bias assessment; meta-analysis (where appropriate); and a weight-of-evidence assessment. A total of 191 relevant experimental studies were identified. Two controlled trials indicated that hot water and steam treatments are effective at reducing the prevalence of Salmonella on beef carcasses (relative risk [RR] = 0.11, 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.02, 0.58), while four trials found that pre-chill organic acid washes are effective at reducing Salmonella on pork carcasses (RR = 0.32, 95\% CI: 0.13, 0.78), with high confidence in the estimates of effect. Four quasi-experimental studies found that post-exsanguination chemical washes were effective to reduce the prevalence of Salmonella on cattle hides, with low confidence in the specific estimate of effect; moderate confidence was found for the effect estimates of scalding (RR = 0.20, 95\% CI: 0.14, 0.29) and singeing (RR = 0.34, 95\% CI: 0.22, 0.52) of pork carcasses. The overall evidence supported enhanced reductions of Salmonella through a multiple-hurdle approach. In conclusion, various slaughter and processing interventions can contribute to reducing Salmonella on beef and pork carcasses, depending on the context of application; an appropriate combination should be selected, validated, and verified by establishment operators within their local conditions.},

	abstract = {Domestic animal husbandry, a common practice globally, can lead to zoonotic transmission of enteric pathogens. However, this risk has received little attention to date. This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the evidence for an association between domestic exposure to food-producing animals and cases of human diarrhea and specific enteric infections. We performed a systematic review of available literature to examine domestic livestock and poultry as risk factors for diarrhea and applied pre-determined quality criteria. Where possible, we carried out meta-analysis of specific animal-pathogen pairs. We found consistent evidence of a positive association between exposure to domestic food-producing animals and diarrheal illness across a range of animal exposures and enteric pathogens. Out of 29 studies included in the review, 20 (69.0\%) reported a positive association between domestic animal exposure and diarrhea. Domestic exposure to poultry revealed a substantial association with human campylobacteriosis (OR 2.73, 95\% CI 1.90-3.93). Our results suggest that domestic poultry and livestock exposures are associated with diarrheal illness in humans. Failure to ascertain the microbial cause of disease may mask this effect. Exposure to domestic animals should be considered a risk factor for human diarrheal illness and additional studies may identify potential mitigation strategies to address this risk.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cysticercosis is caused by the invasion of human or pig tissues by the metacestode larval stage of Taenia solium. In Europe, the disease was endemic in the past but the autochthonous natural life cycle of the parasite is currently completed very rarely. Recently, imported cases have increased in parallel to the increased number of migrations and international travels. The lack of specific surveillance systems for cysticercosis leads to underestimation of the epidemiological and clinical impacts. OBJECTIVES: To review the available data on epidemiology and management of cysticercosis in Europe. METHODS: A review of literature on human cysticercosis and T. solium taeniasis in Europe published between 1990-2011 was conducted. RESULTS: Out of 846 cysticercosis cases described in the literature, 522 cases were autochthonous and 324 cases were imported. The majority (70.1\%) of the autochthonous cases were diagnosed in Portugal from 1983 and 1994. Imported cases of which 242 (74.7\%) diagnosed in migrants and 57 (17.6\%) in European travellers, showed an increasing trend. Most of imported cases were acquired in Latin America (69.8\% of migrants and 44.0\% of travellers). The majority of imported cases were diagnosed in Spain (47.5\%), France (16.7\%) and Italy (8.3\%). One third of neurosurgical procedures were performed because the suspected diagnosis was cerebral neoplasm. Sixty eight autochthonous and 5 imported T. solium taeniasis cases were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Cysticercosis remains a challenge for European care providers, since they are often poorly aware of this infection and have little familiarity in managing this disease. Cysticercosis should be included among mandatory reportable diseases, in order to improve the accuracy of epidemiological information. European health care providers might benefit from a transfer of knowledge from colleagues working in endemic areas and the development of shared diagnostic and therapeutic processes would have impact on the quality of the European health systems.},

	abstract = {The objectives of our study were to evaluate the productive response to methionine supplementation in lactating dairy cows and to define a relationship between metabolizable Met (MP Met) intake and production. A database of 64 papers meeting the selection criteria was developed evaluating postruminally infused dl-methionine (9 papers with 18 control diets and 35 treatment comparisons), 2-hydroxy-4-methylthio butanoic acid (HMTBa) provided as either a liquid or Ca salt form (17 papers with 34 control diets and 46 treatment comparisons), Mepron (Evonik Industries, Essen, Germany; 18 papers with 35 control diets and 42 treatment comparisons), and Smartamine (Adisseo Inc., Antony, France; 20 papers with 30 control diets and 39 treatment comparisons). Dietary ingredients and their accompanying nutritional compositions as described in the reports were entered into the Cornell-Penn-Miner software to model the diets and to predict nutrients that were not reported in the original publication. Data were analyzed using a weighted analysis of response to supplementation compared with the intraexperiment control, as well as through a regression analysis to changing dietary MP Met. Data included in the analysis were from experiments published between 1970 and 2011 with cows supplemented with between 3.5 and 67.9 g of Met or its equivalent from HMTBa. Cows supplemented with Smartamine consumed more, whereas cows supplemented with Mepron consumed less DM compared with controls. Milk yield did not significantly respond to Met supplementation, although it tended to increase for cows supplemented with HMTBa and Mepron. Milk protein yield was increased due to supplementation from all sources or from infusion, and protein concentration was greater for all supplements or infusion of dl-Met, except for cows supplemented with HMTBa. Irrespective of Met source, milk protein yield increased 2.23 g of protein/g of MP Met until reaching the breakpoint. Milk fat yield was increased for Mepron and HMTBa, whereas milk fat concentration was increased for infused dl-Met and for cows supplemented with HMTBa. Based on regression analysis, response of milk fat yield to Met supplementation was not different for infused dl-Met, Mepron, and Smartamine (1.87 g of fat/g of MP Met), whereas the response to HMTBa was significantly greater at 5.38 g of fat/g of MP Met.},

	abstract = {Literature data on utilization of dietary N were analyzed by using meta-analytic procedures for growing milk-fed dairy calves and weaned dairy heifers. The objective was to statistically assess N utilization and excretion in growing dairy cattle when dietary N was altered in otherwise balanced rations at various stages of growth. Studies meeting the selection criteria included data from 16 published papers encompassing 94 distinct observations made on 217 animals. Of these, 6 studied calves were fed milk or milk protein-based milk replacer [milk-fed; 30 to 81 kg of body weight (BW)] with 37 different dietary treatments, and 10 experiments studied heifers receiving diets based on forage, concentrates, or a combination of forage and concentrates (weaned; 56 to 472 kg of BW) with 57 different dietary treatments. Mixed model and fixed effect regression analyses were used to evaluate responses to additional dietary N. True digestibility of dietary N was 100.4\% for milk-fed calves and 96.4\% for weaned heifers, with corresponding basal fecal N excretion values of 3.05 and 6.51 g of N/kg of dry matter intake. Urinary N (g of N/kg of BW(0.75)) was consistently greater for milk-fed calves, but the response to increasing N intake was parallel to the response for weaned heifers. Whether using a mixed model approach or a fixed effect approach to account for metabolizable energy intake, BW, and dry matter intake, milk-fed calves retained more N per kilogram of BW(0.75) than weaned heifers. However, marginal efficiency of N utilization responded as a continuous function of BW, as opposed to a bimodal response associated with diet type. Gross N efficiency (GNE) responded quadratically to N intake and was greater for milk-fed calves than for weaned heifers. Linear and quadratic coefficients of this function did not differ between diet types, indicating that the response in gross N efficiency to additional N intake was not different between diet groups; rather, the absolute level obtainable differed. Dietary CP concentrations of 18.9\% for milk-fed calves and 14.2\% for weaned heifers were found to maximize GNE; 22.5\% MJ of crude protein/MJ of ME was found to maximize GNE for both groups. Equations are discussed relative to the requirements to replace basal N losses and efficiency of N utilization.},

	abstract = {This study examined the extent by which changes in the concentrate level and neutral detergent fiber (NDF) content in the diet as well as the severity of acidotic insult, measured as the duration time of rumen pH below 6.0 and daily mean rumen pH, and the concentration of endotoxin in the rumen fluid are involved in the development of inflammatory conditions in cattle. A meta-analytical approach accounting for inter- and intraexperimental variation was used to generate prediction models, and data from recent studies were used to parameterize these models. A total of 10 recently conducted experiments with 43 different dietary treatments fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in this study. Diets of all of the experiments included in this meta-analysis were based on rapidly degradable grain sources, such as barley and wheat, and the findings of this study apply only to these kinds of diets. Data indicated that greater levels of concentrate in the diet were associated with increased concentrations of rumen endotoxin (R(2)=0.27), plasma haptoglobin (R(2)=0.19), and serum amyloid A (SAA) level (R(2)=0.46). Similar correlations, but in opposite directions, were observed between dietary NDF content and rumen endotoxin (R(2)=0.39) and plasma SAA concentrations (R(2)=0.22). The meta-analysis revealed that the relationships between those variables were not linear. Additionally, the breakpoint model fitted to the data of rumen endotoxin, plasma haptoglobin, and SAA indicated the presence of a threshold level of dietary concentrate and NDF, above which those responses became linear to increasing amounts of concentrate or decreasing contents of NDF in the diet. Also, feeding cattle more than 44.1\% concentrate or less than 39.2\% NDF in the diet was associated with a linear increase in the risk of systemic inflammation. Low daily mean rumen pH (R(2)=0.38) and duration of rumen pH {\textless}6.0 (R(2)=0.59) were associated with increased concentrations of endotoxin in the rumen fluid; although those events were not always associated with systemic inflammation. Accordingly, only 15 to 21\% of the overall variation in the responses of SAA was explained by variables of rumen pH, whereas the concentrate level in the diet accounted for 46\% of this variation. In conclusion, data from this study indicated the presence of thresholds of dietary concentrate and NDF levels in the diets based on rapidly fermentable grains beyond which the risk of systemic inflammation in cattle increases linearly.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, BIOSIS, EMBASE, Global Health, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library from inception to December 2014. Two reviewers independently identified all manuscripts pertaining to the administration of ketamine in both human and animal subjects in which the impact on CBF/cerebral vasculature was recorded by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, xenon computed tomography, transcranial Doppler velocities, arteriovenous difference in N2O method of CBF measurement, cerebral digital subtraction angiography, or any other objective means of CBF determination. RESULTS: We identified 38 animal studies with various animal models studied. Overall there was a trend to a direct vasodilatory effect of ketamine on the cerebral vasculature, with a trend in most studies to an increase or regional CBF (rCBF) or global CBF.Twenty human studies were identified. The majority displayed an increase in rCBF and global CBF on imaging in patients without neurological illness. CONCLUSIONS: Animal models indicate an increase in global CBF and rCBF with ketamine administration, with a trend to vasodilation of medium-sized intracranial vessels through a calcium-dependent mechanism. Human studies display an Oxford 2b, Grading of Recommendation Assessment Development and Education C, level of evidence to support a trend to increased global CBF and rCBF with ketamine administration in both healthy volunteers and elective surgical patients without neurological illness.},

	abstract = {Livestock grazing activities potentially alter ecosystem carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles in grassland ecosystems. Despite the fact that numerous individual studies and a few meta-analyses had been conducted, how grazing, especially its intensity, affects belowground C and N cycling in grasslands remains unclear. In this study, we performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of 115 published studies to examine the responses of 19 variables associated with belowground C and N cycling to livestock grazing in global grasslands. Our results showed that, on average, grazing significantly decreased belowground C and N pools in grassland ecosystems, with the largest decreases in microbial biomass C and N (21.62\% and 24.40\%, respectively). In contrast, belowground fluxes, including soil respiration, soil net N mineralization and soil N nitrification increased by 4.25\%, 34.67\% and 25.87\%, respectively, in grazed grasslands compared to ungrazed ones. More importantly, grazing intensity significantly affected the magnitude (even direction) of changes in the majority of the assessed belowground C and N pools and fluxes, and C : N ratio as well as soil moisture. Specifically,light grazing contributed to soil C and N sequestration whereas moderate and heavy grazing significantly increased C and N losses. In addition, soil depth, livestock type and climatic conditions influenced the responses of selected variables to livestock grazing to some degree. Our findings highlight the importance of the effects of grazing intensity on belowground C and N cycling, which may need to be incorporated into regional and global models for predicting effects of human disturbance on global grasslands and assessing the climate-biosphere feedbacks.},

Examined factors included: Se source (12 different sources examined), type of chicken (laying hens or broilers), age of birds at the beginning of supplementation, duration of supplementation, year during which the study was conducted, sex of birds, number of chickens per treatment, method of analysis, tissue type, concentration of Se determined and Se added to feed. A correlation analysis was also carried out between tissue Se concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity. Data analysis showed that the factors significantly affecting tissue Se concentration include type of chicken (P=0.006), type of tissue (P{\textless}0.001) and the analytical method used (P=0.014). Although Se source was not found to affect tissue Se concentration (overall P{\textgreater}0.05), certain inorganic (sodium selenite), calcium selenite, sodium selenate and organic sources (B-Traxim Se), Se-yeast, Se-malt, Se-enriched cabbage and Se-enriched garlic as well as background Se level from feed ingredients were found to significantly affect tissue Se concentration. The Se accumulation rate (estimated as linear regression coefficient of Se concentrations to Se added to feed) discriminated between the various tissues with highest values estimated in the leg muscle and lowest in blood plasma. Correlation analysis has also shown that tissue Se concentration (pooled data) was correlated to Se added to feed (r=0.529, P{\textless}0.01, log values) and to glutathione peroxidase activity (r=0.332, P=0.0478), with the latter not being correlated with Se added to feed. Although significant factors affecting Se concentration were reported in the present study, they do not necessarily indicate the in vivo function of the antioxidant system or the level of accumulated Se as other factors, not examined in the present study, may interact at the level of trace element absorption, distribution and retention.},

	title = {{NTP} monograph on the systematic review of occupational exposure to cancer chemotherapy agents and adverse health outcomes},
	doi = {10.22427/ntp-mgraph-5},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Many cancer chemotherapy agents are known carcinogens, genetic toxicants, and developmental toxicants. Secondary malignancies, such as therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia, are caused by cancer chemotherapy agents administered to patients for the treatment of cancer. Occupational exposure to these agents was first documented in the 1970s and continues to occur, despite the issuance of safe handling guidelines in 1980s. OBJECTIVES: Based on the evidence of carcinogenicity and genetic toxicity associated with direct administration of cancer chemotherapy agents and current evidence of occupational exposure, the National Toxicology Program (NTP) conducted a systematic review to: (1) evaluate whether occupational exposure (e.g., medical, manufacturing, research, and veterinary) is associated with any adverse health outcomes in humans, and (2) summarize the prevalence and levels of chemotherapy agents in the workplace as measured by environmental monitoring and biomonitoring for possible worker exposures. METHODS: The evaluation was conducted following the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) method. A literature search was performed up to February 23, 2017, using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Toxline, and Web of Science. Relevant human studies were data extracted and assessed for risk of bias. Bodies of evidence were assessed to develop confidence ratings and level-of-evidence conclusions that reflect the certainty in the evidence that occupational exposure to cancer chemotherapy agents are associated with health effects on a per outcome basis. RESULTS AND EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The literature search and screening process identified 110 epidemiological studies relevant to assessing possible adverse health outcomes. Most studies addressing health outcomes evaluated potential DNA damage (n = 66; specifically, structural chromosomal aberrations (CA) and micronucleus (MN) induction and comet assay endpoints) and spontaneous abortion (n = 16). In addition to DNA damage, groups of studies were identified to evaluate the potential association between occupational exposure to cancer chemotherapy agents and adverse health outcomes, including cancer (three studies) and adverse effects on reproduction (30 studies). Additional health outcomes included acute effects, immune effects, and liver and kidney toxicity. One hundred seventy-one studies were identified to assess workplace exposure based on reporting of environmental contamination (107 studies) and urine and/or blood monitoring of these agents (82 studies). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: NTP concluded that there is a moderate level of evidence that occupational exposure to chemotherapy agents is associated with increased incidence of spontaneous abortion, particularly when evaluating studies of nursing and pharmacy personnel. NTP also concluded that there is a moderate level of evidence that exposure to chemotherapy agents in the workplace is associated with genetic toxicity in humans based on consistent reports significantly higher levels of structural CA (\% of cells with CA and number of CA), MN induction (number of cells with MN and number of MN) and DNA damage measured by comet assay (\% tail DNA, tail length, tail moment, and DNA damage index) in exposed personnel. There was inadequate evidence for NTP to reach level-of-evidence conclusions on the remaining health outcomes, including cancer, primarily due to few studies per outcome and heterogeneity in the data. Despite current safety guidelines, cancer chemotherapy agents were commonly detected in environmental samples of the workplace (e.g., surface wipes and air sampling) and biosamples (e.g., urine or blood) of workers handling these agents, including data collected as recently as 2014 to 2016. Considering the potential for occupational exposure to these agents and the association between exposure and DNA damage and spontaneous abortions, there is a continued need to reduce exposures through training in safe handling procedures and provision and use of personal protective equipment and associated safety containment equipment. Health surveillance of occupationally exposed personnel would also benefit from improved exposure characterization methods, such as use of daily diaries that are assessed and validated to estimate exposure levels and additional environmental monitoring and biomonitoring data that include analytical chemistry approaches to assess multiple agents. There is also a need to better understand the sources (i.e., activities or physical locations) of worker exposure, especially in settings that have not been adequately studied (e.g., home care, veterinary clinics).},

	abstract = {Livestock products, such as dairy and beef, are increasingly regarded as resource intensive and concerns are raised about animal welfare and environmental sustainability. As a result, consumer awareness of these issues has led to an increasing demand for products with high quality credence attributes (CAs) that cannot be directly experienced or identified. A number of empirical studies have attempted to estimate consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for CAs, which represents the additional value placed on the benefits that they derive from those products. However, there are significant differences in these WTP estimates, mainly because both consumers' perceptions of CAs and the conditions of the studies vary. We conduct a meta-analysis to examine consumers' WTP for different CAs of livestock products based on a systematic review of relevant studies. Meta-regression models are used to control for the heterogeneity of WTP estimates and investigate factors that affect the estimation of WTP. Overall 555 estimates derived from 94 papers reporting WTP are included in this study. Meta-regression results establish the presence of systematic WTP variation associated with types of products, CAs, and locations, though also indicate that WTP is subject to systematic variation associated with study methodology.},

METHODS: Relevant articles were identified in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science databases using a search time up to January 2019. Generalized least-squares trend estimations and restricted cubic spline regression models were used for analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-eight articles were included in the analysis. When comparing the highest with the lowest category of meat intake, the summary relative risk of T2D was 1.33 (95\% CI: 1.16-1.52) for total meat, 1.22 (95\% CI: 1.16-1.28) for red meat, 1.25 (95\% CI: 1.13-1.37) for processed meat, 1.00 (95\% CI: 0.93-1.07) for poultry and 1.01 (95\% CI: 0.93-1.10) for fish. In the dose-response analysis, each additional 100g/day of total and red meat, and 50g/day of processed meat, were found to be associated with a 36\% (95\% CI: 1.23-1.49), 31\% (95\% CI: 1.19-1.45) and 46\% (95\% CI: 1.26-1.69) increased risk of T2D, respectively. In addition, there was evidence of a non-linear dose-response association between processed meat and T2D (P=0.004), with the risk increasing by 30\% with increasing intakes up to 30g/day. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis has shown a linear dose-response relationship between total meat, red meat and processed meat intakes and T2D risk. In addition, a non-linear relationship of intake of processed meat with risk of T2D was detected.},

However, previous results do not provide a solid scientific basis for quantifying the response of broilers to light intensity. This study performed a meta-analysis to model the response of broilers to 0.1-200 lux of light intensity. Meta-analysis was used to integrate smaller studies and increase the statistical power over that of any single study and explore new hypotheses. The results indicated that light intensity {\textless}5 lux caused welfare concern (P {\textless} 0.05) and light intensity {\textless}1 lux induced productivity loss of broiler (P {\textless} 0.05), whereas greater level of light intensity {\textgreater}10 lux led to increased mortality (P {\textless} 0.01) and decreased uniformity (P {\textless} 0.05). Meta-regression showed that 30-200 lux light intensity was negatively related to BW (P = 0.047) and feed intake change (P = 0.054), whereas a quadratic relationship was observed between feed conversion ratio change and 50-180 lux light intensity (R2 = 0.95). In addition, the majority of carcass characteristics (abdominal fat weight and wing weight) and metabolic indicators (K+, Ca2+, and T3) were affected by light intensity {\textgreater}5 lux. To conclude, this meta-analysis based on published data quantitatively identified that 5 lux of light intensity during grow-out period should be the minimum level to maintain a well productivity and welfare of broiler chickens.},

Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) was widely used in the treatment of LE and has been shown to relieve the pain and functional impairment (loss of grip strength) caused by tennis elbow. However, the evidence with regard to whether ESWT has better clinical efficacy over other method is not clear. The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of ESWT with other techniques in the treatment of LE. METHODS: Literature searches of PubMed, OVID, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science were searched up to 30(th) June, 2019. Only RCTs comparing ESWT with other methods for LE were included. Data collection and extraction, quality assessment, and data analyses were performed according to the Cochrane standards. RESULTS: A total of 13 articles with 1035 patients were included. Of which, 501 underwent ESWT and 534 underwent other methods. The result of meta-analysis showed that pooled VAS (P = 0.0004) and grip strength (P {\textless} 0.00001) were better in the ESWT group. CONCLUSION: Based on the existing clinical evidence, extracorporeal shock wave therapy can effectively relieve the pain and functional impairment (loss of grip strength) caused by tennis elbow, with better overall safety than several other methods. However, owing to the limited quality and quantity of the included studies, more high-quality RCTs are needed to support the trend towards better functional outcomes with ESWT.},

METHODS: We searched the PubMed, Ovid EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases up to August 2018. Eligible publications examining the association between pet ownership and all-cause and CV mortality (primary outcomes) and risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD), myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke (secondary outcomes) were included. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess the quality of the articles. RESULTS: We included 12 studies, involving 488,986 participants (52.3\% female, mean age 56.1 years), in our systematic review. The mean follow-up duration was 8.7 ± 6.3 years. Pet ownership had no association with adjusted all-cause mortality (odds ratio, OR = 1.01, 95\% confidence interval, CI [0.94, 1.08], I2 = 76\%), adjusted CV mortality (OR = 0.87, 95\% CI [0.75, 1.00], I2 = 72\%), or risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (OR = 0.87, 95\% CI [0.72, 1.05], I2 = 73\%), myocardial infarction (MI) (OR = 0.99, 95\% CI [0.97, 1.01], I2 = 0\%), or stroke (OR = 0.99, 95\% CI [0.98, 1.01], I2 = 0\%). However, subgroup analysis showed that pet ownership was associated with a lower adjusted CV mortality in the general population (OR = 0.93, 95\% CI [0.86, 0.99], I2 = 27\%) than in CVD patients. In patients with established CVD, pet ownership was associated with a lower adjusted CVD risk (OR = 0.71, 95\% CI [0.60, 0.84], I2 = 0\%). CONCLUSION: Pet ownership is not associated with adjusted all-cause or CV mortality, or risk of CVD, MI, or stroke, but it is associated with a lower adjusted CV mortality in the general population and a lower CVD risk in patients with established CVD.},

	abstract = {Background: Despite the increased use and worldwide distribution of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) that distinguish between Plasmodium falciparum and non-falciparum species, little is known about their performance detecting Plasmodium knowlesi (Pk), Plasmodium malariae (Pm), and Plasmodium ovale (Po). This review seeks to analyze the results of published studies evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of malaria RDTs in detecting Pk, Pm, and Po monoinfections. Method. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and CENTRAL databases were systematically searched to identify studies that reported the performance of RDTs in detecting Pk, Pm, and Po monoinfections. Result. Among 40 studies included in the review, 3 reported on Pk, 8 on Pm, 5 on Po, 1 on Pk and Pm, and 23 on Pm and Po infections. In the meta-analysis, estimates of sensitivities of RDTs in detecting Pk infections ranged 2\%-48\%. Test performances for Pm and Po infections were less accurate and highly heterogeneous, mainly because of the small number of samples tested. Conclusion. Limited data available suggest that malaria RDTs show suboptimal performance for detecting Pk, Pm, and Po infections. New improved RDTs and appropriately designed cross-sectional studies to demonstrate the usefulness of RDTs in the detection of neglected Plasmodium species are urgently needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinically, severe burns remain one of the most challenging issues, but an ideal treatment is yet absent. Our purpose is to compare the efficacy of stem cell therapy in a preclinical model of burn wound healing. METHODS: Research reports on mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for burn wound healing were retrieved from 5 databases: PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. The primary outcomes reported in this article include the un-healing rate of the wound area, the closure rate, and the wound area. Secondary outcomes included CD-31, vascular density, interleukin (IL)-10, thickness of eschar tissue, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and white blood cell count. Finally, a subgroup analysis was conducted to explore heterogeneity that potentially impacted the primary outcomes. A fixed-effects model with a 95\% confidence interval (CI) was performed when no significant heterogeneity existed. Otherwise, a random-effects model was used. All data analysis was conducted by using Engauge Digitizer 10.8 and R software. RESULTS: Twenty eligible articles were finally included in the analysis. Stem cell therapy greatly improved the closure rate (2.00, 95\% CI 0.52 to 3.48, p = 0.008) and compromised the wound area (- 2.36; 95\% CI - 4.90 to 0.18; p = 0.069) rather than the un-healing rate of the wound area (- 11.10, 95\% CI - 32.97 to 10.78, p = 0.320). Though p was 0.069, there was a trend toward shrinkage of the burn wound area after stem cell therapy. Vascular density (4.69; 95\% CI 0.06 to 9.31; p = 0.047) and thickness of eschar tissue (6.56, 95\% CI 1.15 to 11.98, p = 0.017) were also discovered to be significantly improved in the burn site of stem cell-treated animals. Moreover, we observed that animals in the stem cell group had an increased white blood cell count (0.84, 95\% CI 0.01 to 1.66, p = 0.047) 5 days post treatment. Other indicators, such as VEGF (p = 0.381), CD-31 (p = 0.335) and IL-10 (p = 0.567), were not significantly impacted. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited data from preclinical trials, this meta-analysis suggests that stem cell therapy is curative in decreasing the burn wound area and provides some insights into future clinical studies of stem cell therapy for burns.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of MK-801 and its effect on lesion volume in rat models of acute brain injury. DATA SOURCES: Key terms were "stroke", "brain diseases", "brain injuries", "brain hemorrhage, traumatic", "acute brain injury", "dizocilpine maleate", "dizocilpine", "MK-801", "MK801", "rat", "rats", "rattus" and "murine". PubMed, Cochrane library, EMBASE, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang database, the VIP Journal Integration Platform (VJIP) and SinoMed databases were searched from their inception dates to March 2018. DATA SELECTION: Studies were selected if they reported the effects of MK-801 in experimental acute brain injury. Two investigators independently conducted literature screening, data extraction, and methodological quality assessments. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes included lesion volume and brain edema. The secondary outcomes included behavioral assessments with the Bederson neurological grading system and the water maze test 24 hours after brain injury. RESULTS: A total of 52 studies with 2530 samples were included in the systematic review. Seventeen of these studies had a high methodological quality. Overall, the lesion volume (34 studies, n = 966, MD = -58.31, 95\% CI: -66.55 to -50.07; P {\textless} 0.00001) and degree of cerebral edema (5 studies, n = 75, MD = -1.21, 95\% CI: -1.50 to -0.91; P {\textless} 0.00001) were significantly decreased in the MK-801 group compared with the control group. MK-801 improved spatial cognition assessed with the water maze test (2 studies, n = 60, MD = -10.88, 95\% CI: -20.75 to -1.00; P = 0.03) and neurological function 24 hours after brain injury (11 studies, n = 335, MD = -1.04, 95\% CI: -1.47 to -0.60; P {\textless} 0.00001). Subgroup analysis suggested an association of reduction in lesion volume with various injury models (34 studies, n = 966, MD = -58.31, 95\% CI: -66.55 to -50.07; P = 0.004). Further network analysis showed that 0-1 mg/kg MK-801 may be the optimal dose for treatment in the middle cerebral artery occlusion animal model. CONCLUSION: MK-801 effectively reduces brain lesion volume and the degree of cerebral edema in rat models of experimental acute brain injury, providing a good neuroprotective effect. Additionally, MK-801 has a good safety profile, and its mechanism of action is well known. Thus, MK-801 may be suitable for future clinical trials and applications.},

	abstract = {Canines are proven reservoir hosts of Leishmania infantum, the causative agent of human zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis, and therefore domestic dogs play a central role in transmitting the disease to humans. Studies on the effect of insecticide-impregnated dog collars for controlling canine visceral leishmaniasis (CanL) have been increasing; however, meta-analysis has not been conducted. This study assessed the effectiveness of insecticide-impregnated dog collars for preventing CanL. We searched (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Ovid Medline(R), and Cochrane library), from inception until 2 May 2020. Two authors independently performed articles screening and data extraction. We applied the RoB 2.0 tool to evaluate the risk of bias in randomized trials, while the ROBINS-I tool was used for non-randomized trials. I-squared statistics(I2) and funnel plot and Egger's test, respectively, were used to assesses heterogeneity between studies and publication bias. Relative Risk (RR) and 95\% Confidence Interval (CI) were calculated using the random-effects model in Stata 14 software. Out of 242 citations identified, 14 studies comprising 3786 collared dogs and 3428 uncollared dogs were eligible for meta-analysis. The use of deltamethrin-impregnated dog collars(DMC) showed an overall effectiveness of 54\% (95\%CI: 35-65\%, I2 = 63.2\%, P = 0.002) in decreasing incidence of CanL, while 10\% imidacloprid and 4.5\% flumethrin collars provided an overall effectiveness of 90\% (95\%CI: 80-96\%, I2 = 0.0\%, P = 0.376). DMC efficacy stratified by follow-up duration was estimated to be 58\% (RR = 0.42, 95\%CI: 0.20-0.87), 54\% (RR = 0.46, 95\%CI: 0.31-0.68), 53\% (RR = 0.47, 95\%CI: 0.29-0.82) for follow-up periods of 5 to 6 months, 1 year and 2 years, respectively. The current evidence indicates that using insecticide-impregnated dog collars can reduce the risk of CanL caused by L. infantum. Therefore, insecticide-impregnated dog collars could be a viable alternative for inclusion as a public health measure for controlling CanL.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is one of the common neurological illnesses which affects millions of individuals globally. Although the majority of epileptic patients have a good response for the currently available antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), about 30-40\% of epileptic patients are developing resistance. In addition to low safety profiles of most of existing AEDs, there is no AED available for curative or disease-modifying actions for epilepsy so far. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review is intended to evaluate the effect of metformin in acute and chronic animal models of an epileptic seizure. METHODS: We searched PubMed, SCOPUS, Sciences Direct, and grey literature in order to explore articles published in English from January 2010 to November 2018, using key terms "epilepsy," "seizure," "metformin," "oral hypoglycemic agents," and "oral antidiabetic drugs". The qualities of all the included articles were assessed according to the Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies (CAMARADES). RESULTS: Out of six hundred fifty original articles retrieved, eleven of them fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included for final qualitative analysis. In these studies, metformin showed to control seizure attacks by attenuating seizure generation, delaying the onset of epilepsy, reducing hippocampal neuronal loss, and averting cognitive impairments in both acute and chronic models of an epileptic seizure. The possible mechanisms for its antiseizure or antiepileptic action might be due to activation of AMPK, antiapoptotic, antineuroinflammatory, and antioxidant properties, which possibly modify disease progression through affecting epileptogenesis. CONCLUSION: This review revealed the benefits of metformin in alleviating symptoms of epileptic seizure and modifying different cellular and molecular changes that affect the natural history of the disease in addition to its good safety profile.},

Major emission activities were identified and synthesised into a cradle-to-cooked-edible-meat lifecycle system. 270 emission factors were identified from publications and taken as baselines. 67\% baseline evaluation boundaries stopped at farm-gate, only 3\% at home/restaurants. Baseline emission gaps were identified by comparing baseline evaluation systems against the synthesised system. Emission factors for major activities were identified from publications and mean values were used to fill emission gaps in order to obtain the cradle-to-cooked-edible-meat emission factors, which were then grouped to obtain a mean cradle-to-cooked-edible-meat emission factor for each meat type. Mean emission factors (kg CO$_{\textrm{2}}$-eq/kg) for adjusted cradle-to-cooked-edible-meats were: Bovine 61.3 (n=124), Ovine 61.2 (n=38), Pig 15.8 (n=56) and Poultry 9.4 (n=52), which are significantly higher than the adjusted means for carcass at regional-distribution-centre: Bovine 23.9 (n=118), Ovine 23.3 (n=9), Pig 5.0 (n=51) and Poultry 3.6 (n=45); or the adjusted means for saleable meat at retail: Bovine 32.3 (n=122), Ovine 31.2 (n=36), Pig 7.9 (54), and Poultry 4.2 (n=50). This study confirmed current meat emission evaluations reflect only a fraction of dietary impacts. Emission factors for cooked-edible-meat could be three times the amount of meat commodities at farm-gate. Emission factors vary significantly within and between meat types.},

	abstract = {Background: Strongyloidiasis is a gastrointestinal infection caused by the parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercoralis. It is estimated to infect up to 370 million people globally and is predominately found in tropical and subtropical areas of socioeconomic disadvantage. Main body: This systematic literature review identified studies published in the last ten years on the risk factors, diagnosis, prevalence and/or clinical outcomes of strongyloidiasis in Ethiopia. The prevalence of S. stercoralis ranged from 0.2 to 11.1\% in adults, 0.3\% to 20.7\% in children, 1.5\% to 17.3\% in HIV positive adults and 5\% in HIV positive children. The identified studies primarily used microscopy based techniques that potentially underestimated the prevalence four fold compared with serology and PCR. Strongyloidiasis in children presents a particularly significant issue in Ethiopia as children often presented with anemia, which is associated with impaired mental and cognitive development. The most significant risk factor for strongyloidiasis was HIV status and although other risk factors were identified for helminth infections, none were statistically significant for S. stercoralis specifically. Several studies detected S. stercoralis in dogs and non-biting cyclorrhaphan flies. However, future research is needed to explore the role of these reservoirs in disease transmission. Conclusions: This review demonstrated that strongyloidiasis is an overlooked and neglected disease in Ethiopia. There is a need for a systematic approach using a combination of molecular and serology based diagnostic methods to ascertain the true incidence and burden of strongyloidiasis in Ethiopia. Further research is also needed to break the cycle of transmission by identifying environmental reservoirs, risk factors and exploring the potential for zoonotic transfer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biomonitoring studies indicate a trend towards increased human exposure to diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), a replacement for dibutyl phthalate (DBP). Recent reviews have found DIBP to be a male reproductive toxicant, but have not evaluated other hazards of DIBP exposure. OBJECTIVE: To inform chemical risk assessment, we performed a systematic review to identify and characterize outcomes within six broad hazard categories (male reproductive, female reproductive, developmental, liver, kidney, and cancer) following exposure of nonhuman mammalian animals to DIBP or the primary metabolite, monoisobutyl phthalate (MIBP). METHODS: A literature search was conducted in four online scientific databases [PubMed, Web of Science, Toxline, and Toxic Substances Control Act Test Submissions 2.0 (TSCATS2)], and augmented by review of regulatory sources as well as forward and backward searches. Studies were identified for inclusion based on defined PECO (Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome) criteria. Studies were evaluated using criteria defined a priori for reporting quality, risk of bias, and sensitivity using a domain-based approach. Evidence was synthesized by outcome and life stage of exposure, and strength of evidence was summarized into categories of robust, moderate, slight, indeterminate, or compelling evidence of no effect, using a structured framework. RESULTS: Nineteen toxicological studies in rats or mice met the inclusion criteria. There was robust evidence that DIBP causes male reproductive toxicity. Male rats and mice exposed to DIBP during gestation had decreased testosterone and adverse effects on sperm or testicular histology, with additional phthalate syndrome effects observed in male rats. There was also evidence of androgen-dependent and -independent male reproductive effects in rats and mice following peripubertal or young adult exposure to DIBP or MIBP, but confidence was reduced because of concerns over risk of bias and sensitivity in the available studies. There was also robust evidence that DIBP causes developmental toxicity; specifically, increased post-implantation loss and decreased pre- and postnatal growth. For other hazards, evidence was limited by the small number of studies, experimental designs that were suboptimal for evaluating outcomes, and study evaluation concerns such as incomplete reporting of methods and results. There was slight evidence for female reproductive toxicity and effects on liver, and indeterminate evidence for effects on kidney and cancer. CONCLUSION: Results support DIBP as a children's health concern and indicate that male reproductive and developmental toxicities are hazards of DIBP exposure, with some evidence for female reproductive and liver toxicity. Data gaps include the need for more studies on male reproductive effects following postnatal and adult exposure, and studies to characterize potential hormonal mechanisms in females.},

In this systematic review, we aimed to compile and discuss all articles that describe experimental or natural infections with SARS-CoV-2, from the initial discovery of the virus in December 2019 through to October 2020. We systematically searched four databases (Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct and Web of Science). The following data were extracted from the included studies: type of infection (natural or experimental), age, sample numbers, dose, route of inoculation, viral replication, detection method, clinical symptoms and transmission. Fifty-four studies were included, of which 34 were conducted on animal reservoirs (naturally or experimentally infected), and 20 involved models for testing vaccines and therapeutics. Our search revealed that Rousettus aegyptiacus (fruit bats), pangolins, felines, mink, ferrets and rabbits were all susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, while dogs were weakly susceptible and pigs, poultry, and tree shrews were not. In addition, virus replication in mice, mink, hamsters and ferrets resembled subclinical human infection, so these animals might serve as useful models for future studies to evaluate vaccines or antiviral agents and to study host-pathogen interactions. Our review comprehensively summarized current evidence on SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals and their usefulness as models for studying vaccines and antiviral drugs. Our findings may direct future studies for vaccine development, antiviral drugs and therapeutic agents to manage SARS-CoV-2-caused diseases.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: There is controversy about the role of scaffolds as an adjunctive therapy to mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation in spinal cord injury (SCI). Thus, the authors aimed to design a meta-analysis on preclinical evidence to evaluate the effectiveness of combination therapy of scaffold + MSC transplantation in comparison with scaffolds alone and MSCs alone in improving motor dysfunction in SCI. METHODS: Electronic databases including Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched from inception until the end of August 2018. Two independent reviewers screened related experimental studies. Animal studies that evaluated the effectiveness of scaffolds and/or MSCs on motor function recovery following experimental SCI were included. The findings were reported as standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95\% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 34 articles were included in the meta-analysis. Analyses show that combination therapy in comparison with the scaffold group alone (SMD 2.00, 95\% CI 1.53-2.46, p {\textless} 0.0001), the MSCs alone (SMD 1.58, 95\% CI 0.84-2.31, p {\textless} 0.0001), and the nontreated group (SMD 3.52, 95\% CI 2.84-4.20, p {\textless} 0.0001) significantly improved motor function recovery. Co-administration of MSCs + scaffolds only in the acute phase of injury (during the first 3 days after injury) leads to a significant recovery compared to scaffold alone (SMD 2.18, p {\textless} 0.0001). In addition, the cotransplantation of scaffolds with bone marrow-derived MSCs (SMD 1.99, p {\textless} 0.0001) and umbilical cord-derived MSCs (SMD 1.50, p = 0.001) also improved motor function following SCI. CONCLUSIONS: The findings showed that scaffolds + MSCs is more effective than scaffolds and MSCs alone in improving motor function following SCI in animal models, when used in the acute phase of injury.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: There is still controversy about the effect of early hypothermia on the outcome of spinal cord injury (SCI). The aim of this review article is to investigate the effect of local or general hypothermia on improving the locomotion after traumatic SCI. METHODS: Electronic databases (Medline and Embase) were searched from inception until May 7, 2018. Two independent reviewers screened and summarized the relevant experimental studies on hypothermia efficacy in traumatic SCI. The data were analyzed and the findings were presented as pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI). RESULTS: 20 papers containing 30 separate experiments were included in meta-analysis. The onset of hypothermia varied between 0 and 240 minutes after SCI. Administration of hypothermia has a positive effect on locomotion following SCI (SMD=0.56 95\% CI: 0.18-0.95, p=0.004). Subgroup analysis showed that general hypothermia improves locomotion recovery (SMD =0.89, 95\% CI: 0.42 to 1.36; p {\textless}0.0001), while local hypothermia does not have a significant effect on motor recovery (SMD=0.20, 95 \% CI: -0.36-0.76, p=0.478). In addition, general hypothermia was found to affect motor recovery only if its duration was between 2 and 8 hours (SMD=0.89; p{\textless}0.0001) and the target temperature for induction of hypothermia was between 32 and 35° C (SMD=0.83; p{\textless}0.0001). CONCLUSION: We found that general hypothermia improves locomotion after SCI in rats. Duration of induction and the target temperature are two essential considerations for general therapeutic hypothermia.},

	abstract = {Zoonotic bacterial infections are a health hazard for people who are in regular contact with livestock at the farm level. Improved biosecurity can limit zoonotic pathogen transmission within farms. The aim of this review was to summarize the effectiveness of farm-level biosecurity interventions in reducing bacterial transmission from animals to people who lived, worked in or visited farms. A systematic literature review was conducted using Embase, Ovid Medline and Agris databases, which were searched on 7(th) of July 2019, limited to English language papers but with no time exclusion criteria. A narrative synthesis was undertaken utilizing the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination approach, reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Risk of bias within and across the included studies was performed using established checklists. Out of 869 studies retrieved through database searches, 11 studies were selected. In addition, three studies were found through study reference lists. Fourteen studies were therefore included in this review. Biosecurity interventions were grouped into five categories: hand washing, sanitization and hygienic measures (six studies); personal protective equipment (five studies); vaccination (two studies); other interventions (e.g. air ventilation flap) (four studies); and routine farm activities (two studies). Across studies that investigated odds of human colonization or infection (three studies), odds were seen to both be increased and decreased through use of tested biosecurity measures. Large confidence intervals that often crossed the threshold of an odds ratio equal to 1 were found. Most of the studies' overall risk of bias was 'medium risk' (11 studies), with selection bias domains generally being scored 'medium risk.' Biosecurity interventions are potentially beneficial in reducing bacterial transmission from animals to humans. However, more high-quality evidence is needed to increase certainty in which interventions, in which contexts, are most effective from the human health perspective.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) is a highly prevalent symptom, which afflicts vast majority of patients who suffer from cancer. The current treatment options failed to achieve satisfactory effect and the side effects were prominent. Recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of animal demonstrate the benefit of acupuncture for CIBP. We sought to determine if the pooled data from available RCTs supports the use of acupuncture for CIBP. METHODS: A literature search for randomized controlled trials was conducted in six electronic databases from inception to May 31, 2019. Meta-analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.3 software; the publication bias was assessed by Stata 12.0 software. We used random effects model for pooling data because heterogeneity is absolute among studies to some extent. RESULTS: Twenty-four trials were included in the review, of which 12 trials provided detailed data for meta-analyses. Preliminary evidence indicates that compared to wait list/sham group, acupuncture was effective on increasing paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) and paw withdrawal latency (PWL). Compared to medicine, acupuncture was less effective on PWT, but as effective as medicine on PWL. Acupuncture can reinforce medicine's effect on PWT and PWL. Compared to the control group, acupuncture was superior to increase body weight (BW), decrease spinal cord glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Furthermore, some studies showed acupuncture delay or partially reverse morphine tolerance. Three studies found acupuncture has no effect on PWT, but 2 of them found acupuncture could enhance small dose of Celebrex's effect on CIBP. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture was superior to wait list/sham acupuncture on increasing PWT and has no less effect on increasing PWL compared to medicine; acupuncture improved the efficacy of drugs, increased the CIBP animals' body weight, and decreased their spinal cord GFAP and IL-1β. High-quality studies are necessary to confirm the results.},

	abstract = {The Wilms tumor-1 (WT1) protein is an important regulator of malignant hematopoiesis and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Recently special attention has been paid to the relationship of the WT1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs16754 with AML risk and outcome, but the conflicting results made it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. In the present study, we systematically reviewed the literature and performed a meta-analysis of existing evidence. We searched Embase, Pubmed, Web of Science, Medline, Cochrane Library, Wanfang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases using predefined search methodology for relevant studies. We pooled odd ratio (OR) with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) to evaluate the association between SNP rs16754 and AML risk. In addition, we analyzed hazard ratio (HR) with 95\% CI for overall survive, relapse-free survival, and disease-free survival. Q-statistic was used to assess the homogeneity and Egger test was used to evaluate publication bias. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria for analysis. The results of fixed-effect meta-analyses revealed no association between SNP rs16754 and AML risk (AA + GA vs GG: OR = 0.92, 95\% CI: 0.71-1.19, P = .518; AA vs GA + GG: OR = 1.23, 95\% CI: 0.86-1.76, P = .262; AA vs GG: OR = 1.05, 95\% CI: 0.68-1.63, P = .820; AG vs AA: OR = 0.77, 95\% CI: 0.53-1.13, P = .186; AG vs GG: OR = 0.89, 95\% CI: 0.68-1.16, P = .376). In subgroup analysis by race, age, and disease type, we did not find any significant association. However, the presence of rs16754 GA/GG genotype was associated with improved overall survive (HR = 0.48, 95\% CI: 0.26-0.91, P = .024) and relapse-free survival (HR = 0.82, 95\% CI: 0.68-1.00, P = .048) compared with the rs16754 AA. In summary, the WT1 SNP rs16754 was not associated with AML risk, but it had a significant impact on clinical outcome in AML patients.},

Data were extracted independently in duplicate, and meta-analyses were performed by pooling unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio (OR) separately. Heterogeneity was explored using I(2) and publication bias by funnel plots and Begg's tests. In total, 45 studies from 20 countries were included. Meta-analyses using adjusted data showed that no associations were observed between early introduction of CM or CMF and the risk of asthma ({\textless} 4 vs. ≥ 4 months: OR 1.16, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.89, 1.51), wheeze ({\textless} 6 vs. ≥ 6 months: OR 1.15, 95\% CI 0.85, 1.56), and eczema or atopic dermatitis ({\textless} 6 vs. ≥ 6 months: OR 0.96, 95\% CI 0.65, 1.41). Overall, quite little high-quality evidence was identified to allow for definitive conclusions on the association between early CM or CMF introduction and risk of allergic diseases.

This study aimed to evaluate the seroprevalence of HEV among the general population, occupational population and swine in mainland China and its risk factors based on a systematic review and meta-analysis. Systematic search from EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and several Chinese databases, such as Wanfang (WF) Data, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP) and SINOMED, was searched from inception up to 25 April 2018. The overall seroprevalence of HEV and its corresponding 95\% confidence interval (CI) as well as the correlation coefficients between different groups were estimated using stata 12.0 and r-3.4.1 software. Potential sources of heterogeneity were explored using subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Twenty-eight studies with 57,274 participants (including human and swine) were included. The seroprevalence of anti-HEV immunoglobulin G (IgG) among the general population, occupational population and swine was 27.3\% (95\% CI: 22.4-32.2), 47.4\% (95\% CI: 40.1-54.8) and 66.4\% (95\% CI: 61.7-71.1), respectively. The overall prevalence of IgM among the general population was 1.8\% (95\% CI: 0.7-2.9). The odds ratio for the occupational population, as compared to the general population, was 2.63. The highest anti-HEV IgG prevalence (59\%) was observed in East China, whereas the lowest (34.8\%) was noted in Northeast and North China. In the occupational population, the highest prevalence (77.0\%) was observed among swine vendors. Seven studies included 30,392 participants (humans and swine); the correlation coefficient for the prevalence of anti-HEV IgG between the professional population and adult pigs was 0.88. Sensitivity analyses showed that the stability of results was not considered significant. This research found that HEV is common in China, and contact with pork or other pig products may be an important mode of HEV transmission.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Despite recent advances in depression treatment, many patients still do not respond to serial conventional therapies and are considered "treatment resistant." Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has therapeutic potential in this context. This comprehensive review of recent studies of DBS for depression in animal models identifies potential biomarkers for improving therapeutic efficacy and predictability of conventional DBS to aid future development of closed-loop control of DBS system. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search was performed in Pubmed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Review using relevant keywords. In overall, 56 animal studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Outcomes were divided into biochemical/physiological, electrophysiological, and behavioral categories. Promising biomarkers include biochemical assays (in particular, microdialysis and electrochemical measurements), which provide real-time results in awake animals. Electrophysiological tests, showing changes at both the target site and downstream structures also revealed characteristic changes at several anatomic targets (such as the medial prefrontal cortex and locus coeruleus). However, the substantial range of models and DBS targets limits the ability to draw generalizable conclusions in animal behavioral models. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, DBS is a promising therapeutic modality for treatment-resistant depression. Different outcomes have been used to assess its efficacy in animal studies. From the review, electrophysiological and biochemical markers appear to offer the greatest potential as biomarkers for depression. However, to develop closed-loop DBS for depression, additional preclinical and clinical studies with a focus on identifying reliable, safe, and effective biomarkers are warranted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dog-assisted therapy (DAT) is a non-pharmacological intervention based on the interaction between patients and dogs, which has been proposed to help adults with dementia. However, evidence to support it is lacking. Thus, we aim to evaluate the effects of DAT on this population and to assess the certainty of the evidence of the RCTs estimates. METHODS: A systematic search was performed. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental (QE) controlled studies published up to March 2018, which evaluated the beneficial and deleterious effects of DAT in adults with dementia. Mean differences (MD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) and their 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) were calculated and random effects meta-analyses were performed. Certainty of evidence was assessed for RCTs estimates using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. The study protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42018090434). RESULTS: Ten studies (six RCTs and four QE controlled studies) were eligible for inclusion. Meta-analysis of RCTs showed no effect of DAT in daily life activities (SMD: 0.16; 95\% CI: -0.80 to 1.12), depression (SMD: -0.45; 95\% CI: -2.81 to 1.91), agitation (SDM: -1.12; 95\% CI: -2.67 to 0.43), quality of life (SDM: 0.16; 95\% CI: -0.41 to 0.73), and cognitive impairment (SDM: -0.52; 95\% CI: -1.33 to 0.30), but it found a beneficial effect in apathy (1 study, n = 37, MD: 1.81; 95\% CI: 1.26 to 2.36). All outcomes had a very low certainty of evidence according to GRADE methodology. CONCLUSIONS: RCTs evidence of very low certainty suggests that, in adults with dementia, DAT has no effect in daily life activities, depression, agitation, quality of life, and cognitive impairment, although one small study found an apparent beneficial effect in apathy. More well-designed and correctly reported studies are needed in order to provide a conclusion. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CRD42018090434 (PROSPERO).},

The number of muscle and fat cells that the animal will have throughout its life is determined in the foetal stage and is influenced by nutrition of the pregnant cow. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of different energy levels (total digestible nutrient, TDN) and crude protein (CP) supplied to pregnant cows on foetal weight at 4 (FW4) and 8 months (FW8) and calf birth weight (CBW). Four studies and six trials involving 170 animals were assessed for FW4; four studies, four trials and 156 animals for FW8 and 48 studies, 125 trials and 9053 animals for CBW. High heterogeneity across studies was presented in FW4 (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=94.4\%), FW8 (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=91.08\%) and CBW (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=96.9\%). Dietary TDN and CP levels did not influence FW4. The FW8 was reduced by 2.24 kg when cows were fed 100\% of their CP and TDN requirements (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=0\%), relative to those fed 70\% of their requirements during the first and second trimesters. The CBW was reduced by 0.45 kg (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=96.9\%) when cows were fed 130\% of their CP requirements relative to other dietary CP levels. When cows were fed 140\% of their TDN requirements, CBW decreased by 2.71 kg (I$^{\textrm{2}}$=98.3\%) relative to other TDN levels. Dietary energy or CP levels fed above the requirements to pregnant cows restrict foetal development and CBW.},

	abstract = {A systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis (MA) were performed to evaluate the effects of different energy levels (metabolizable energy, ME) and crude protein (CP), supplied to pregnant cows, on weight of their progenies at 60 (BW60), 100 (BW100), 180 (BW180) and 205 (BW205) days of age, average daily gain (ADG), and weight, age, loin eye area (LEA), marbling and fat thickness (FT) at slaughter. The SR was performed on two electronic databases. The MA for random effects was performed for each response variable separately. The BW60 was reduced (P{\textless}0.001; I2 = 78.9\%) when cows consumed CP and ME above the required levels during the third trimester of pregnancy (3TRI). The BW205 was lower (P{\textless}0.001; I2 = 92.6\%) when cows consumed ME above the recommended levels in the second trimester of pregnancy (2TRI) and 3TRI. Conversely, the ADG was higher when cows consumed CP (P = 0.032; I2 = 96.1\%) and ME (P{\textless}0.001; I2 = 96.1\%) above the required levels. The steers whose mothers consumed CP and ME above the required levels during the 3TRI were slaughtered 5.5 days earlier (P = 0.015; I2 = 98.5\%) compared to other steers. The marbling was higher (P{\textless}0.001; I2 = 91.7\%) in calves born to mothers consuming CP and ME above the recommended levels, regardless of the gestation phase. The FT was higher (P{\textless}0.001; I2 = 0\%) in the offspring of cows that consumed CP and ME above the required levels during the 3TRI. Thus, CP and ME intake, at levels higher than those recommended by the NRC, by pregnant cows in the 3TRI reduces the progeny weight up to 205 days of age. However, this is advantageous during the finishing phase, as it reduces slaughter age and increases the ADG and carcass quality by improving marbling and FT.},

	abstract = {Wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons of the spinal dorsal horn respond to a wide range of innocuous and noxious mechanical stimulation and encode the intensity of mechanical stimuli as changes in firing rate. However, there are inconsistent findings regarding whether WDR neuron stimulus encoding activity is altered in pathological pain states. This inconsistency may arise from differences in the pain models used or in the experimental conditions themselves. In this study, we use a meta-regression approach to examine which variables modulate and determine WDR activity. We pooled data from in vivo electrophysiological studies of WDR activity evoked by von Frey filament stimulation of the hind paw in rats across a number of pathological pain models. We observed that WDR firing rate was better predicted by the calculated pressure of von Frey stimulation rather than applied filament force, as reported in all studies. The pressure-evoked firing rate of WDR neurons was not altered by any experimental pain model except for arthritis and inflammation models, where mechanical stimuli evoked a higher firing rate than controls. Conversely, there was a consistent increase in the spontaneous firing rate of WDR neurons in neuropathic pain, arthritis and inflammation, and chemoneuropathy pain models. Overall, these data indicate that changes in WDR encoding of applied pressure are unlikely to significantly contribute to pathological sensory processing but suggest a possible role for these neurons in spontaneous pain.},

	abstract = {Although exposure to high levels of microbial bioaerosols can be linked to the deterioration of the human respiratory system, precise exposure levels responsible for such effects are still unknown. A previous systematic review concluded that there was not enough information in the studies in humans to derive an exposure-response relationship. Thus, the aim of this systematic review was to derive exposure limits for microbial bioaerosols based on health effects in experimental animal studies. A systematic search was done in MEDLINE (PubMed) for long-term in vivo exposure of the respiratory system via inhalation of a quantified microbial bioaerosol. A total of n = 301 studies were retrieved. Abstract screening using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria was followed by full-text screening and standardized data extraction of study characteristics and measured outcomes. As a result, four suitable studies were identified where mice or guinea pigs were exposed for 4-12 weeks to a previously described mixture of fungal spores or conidia via inhalation. The number of macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils and lymphocytes following subchronic exposure has been reported by all included papers and suggested a dose- and time-dependent relationship. Significant inflammation was observed following subacute exposure to Aspergillus fumigatus. However, the outcomes of the studies could not be directly compared due to the large degree of variation and poor description of the exposure conditions. It is our conclusion that more experimental research needs to be done with the specific aim of establishing a No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (NOAEL) and a Lowest-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (LOAEL) for exposure to microbial bioaerosols in ambient air. Expertise of both exposure and outcome assessment should be brought together to enable standardization of experimental animal studies with properly generated aerosols aiming to derive health-based exposure limits.},

METHODS: Five electronic databases (Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched for studies about CPS among older people. All types of publications were included, with the exception of systematic reviews, meta-analyses, opinion letters, editorials, case reports, conference abstracts and comments. An additional search in Google Scholar and a manual review of the reference lists were performed. RESULTS: Overall, 103 studies were included. Several studies explored the role of CPS in the preservation or improvement of muscle mass among healthy subjects (40 studies) and pre-frail, frail or sarcopenic patients (14), with evidence of beneficial effects. Other studies assessed the effect of CPS on bones (12), cardiovascular disease (8), inflamm-aging (7), chronic pulmonary disease (4), neurocognitive function (4), and vaccines (2), with weak evidence of positive effects. Seven studies in the field of protein metabolism investigated the role of CPS as an important contributor to nutritional needs. Other investigational areas are considered in the last five studies. CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial effects of CPS in achieving aged-related nutritional goals, in preserving muscle mass and in recovering after hospitalization may be particularly relevant in the elderly.},

	abstract = {Schistosomiasis control is heavily reliant on the drug praziquantel (PZQ), which is used as preventive chemotherapy as part of national helminth control strategies. Given the heavy reliance on PZQ for mass drug administration, there has been considerable research on the potential of parasites developing resistance to the drug, resulting in decreased drug efficacy. However, there have been comparatively fewer studies of other factors that can potentially alter PZQ efficacy. Here, we investigate whether host PZQ metabolism contributes towards variable cure rates. We evaluate factors that can influence the metabolism of PZQ and the resultant effect on the efficacy of PZQ treatment to determine factors that potentially influence an individual's response to the drug. The literature search was directed at published studies from three online databases: Web of Science, PubMed, and EMBASE. The search terms for the review comprised of ([praziquantel OR PZQ] AND [schistosom* OR bilharzia] AND [pharmaco*]) and included studies evaluating PZQ metabolism. Publications were categorised into pharmacokinetics, drug-drug interactions, pharmacogenetics, and metabolite analysis. Forty publications describing human and experimental studies fitted the inclusion criteria and were subjected to data extraction and analysis. The analyses showed that variable exposure to PZQ was associated with alterations in the liver's capacity to metabolise PZQ and observed drug-drug interactions. Other factors influencing the efficacy of PZQ were brand, formulation, and co-administered food. Although some work has been performed on metabolite identification, there was minimal information on PZQ's metabolic pathway, and no pharmacogenetics studies were identified. The study indicated that in both human and experimental studies alterations in the liver's capacity to metabolise PZQ as well as drug-drug interactions affected systemic levels of PZQ that could result in variable cure rates. The study confirmed previous findings of higher antischistosomal activity of (R)-PZQ enantiomer when administered alone compared to the racemate at the same dose as well as improved efficacy when the drug is administered with food. The study also highlighted the need for more comprehensive studies of the PZQ metabolic pathway and PZQ pharmacogenetic studies in humans.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii infecting virtually all warm-blooded animals, including humans, is an intracellular protozoan parasite. The immunocompromised patients or pregnant women infected by Toxoplasma usually can cause encephalitis or abortion. Deer are also the important intermediate host of the parasite and people can be infected by ingesting the undercooked venison. Therefore, to raise the attention of the researchers and T. gondii infection on people in deer, we conducted the meta-analysis. All potential publications on the T. gondii infection in deer were retrieved by searching the PubMed, ScienceDirect, Springer- Link, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang, and VIP Chinese Journal Databases. Finally, a total of 48 publications were included. The pooled seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in deer was 22.92\% (95\% CI 17.89-28.38) calculated by the random effect model. The seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in deer was the lowest in Asia (12.72\%, 95\% CI 6.29-20.89), and the highest in North America (32.21\%, 95\% CI 20.32-45.39). The highest point estimate of deer T. gondii in detection method subgroup was using MAT (31.28\%, 95\% CI 20.15-43.61). The estimated pooled seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in elk (63.50\%, 95\% CI 50.01-76.01) was higher than other types of deer. Our meta-regression analysis found that the subgroups including region, sampling year, age, climate, and deer species may be the main heterogeneous source in our meta-analysis. It is necessary to monitor the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in deer at all times. Furthermore, people should be taken to precautions when ingesting the venison by cooking it well before serving to prevent the T. gondii infection via eating venison.},

The articles were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, performed by two reviewers. RESULTS: A total of 373 articles were obtained using PubMed database. After screening, 20 articles were identified as relevant for the purpose of this systematic review. We collected the data of biological scaffolds and synthetic scaffolds. There are eight clinical studies of biological scaffolds included collagen, gelatin, and cellular scaffolds for bone healing. In addition, 12 clinical studies of synthetic scaffolds on HAp, TCP, bonelike, and their complex scaffolds for repairing bone defects were involved in this systematic review. CONCLUSIONS: There are a lot of clinical evidences showed that application of scaffolds had a good ability to facilitate bone repair and osteogenesis. However, the ideal and reliable guidelines are insufficiently applied and the number and quality of studies in this field remain to be improved.},

	abstract = {To systematically assess the effects of hydroxyapatite bone repair scaffold coated with bone morphogenetic protein-2 on murine calvarial defect models and to determine the quality of studies according to the Animal Research Reporting in In Vivo Experiments guidelines. Internet search was performed in duplicate using PubMed, MEDLINE, Ovid and Embase databases (without restrictions on publication date). The Animal Research Reporting in In Vivo Experiments guidelines were used to evaluate the quality of selected studies. Following screening, 12 studies were eligible for the review. Studies with average quality coefficients predominated (66.67\%), followed by poor (25\%) and excellent (8.33\%) quality coefficients. Minimum quality scores were assigned to the Animal Research Reporting in In Vivo Experiments guideline items: housing and husbandry (9), allocation (11), outcomes (12), interpretation (18) and generalizability (19). Sprague-Dawley rats were the most frequently used (50\%) species, and most studies had a sample size of more than 30 (58.33\%). A defect dimension of 5 mm was the most common (33.33\%). The biological hydroxyapatite composite scaffold was common (50\%), and the bioactive factors were bone morphogenetic protein-2 (50\%) and recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (50\%). Histomorphometric results showed that bone morphogenetic protein-2 enhanced the capacity to regenerate bone considerably. In addition, scaffolds with bone morphogenetic protein-2 resulted in a significant increase in the blood vessel in the new bone. The findings suggested that data on animal experiments of hydroxyapatite scaffold coated with bone morphogenetic protein-2 in murine calvarial defect models lack homogeneity. Animal experiment should follow the Animal Research Reporting in In Vivo Experiments guidelines to promote the high quality, integrity and reproducibility. This systematic review suggested that bone morphogenetic protein-2 enhanced the capacity to regenerate bone and the angiogenesis in the new bone.},

	abstract = {Melatonin is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent that is showing promising results in acute brain injury. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the pre-clinical evidence on the effectiveness of melatonin in improving outcome after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We searched mainstream databases from the inception to the end of June 2020. Outcomes were measured by neurobehavioral scores or brain water content. Meta-analyses were performed with Stata 12.0 and Review Manager 5.3. Finally, 8 articles published from 2008 to 2019 met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of pre-clinical data revealed an overall positive effect on neurobehavioral outcome with a standardized mean difference (SMD) of -0.81 (95\% CI: -1.47, -0.15; p = 0.016) with significant heterogeneity (Q = 41.49, I(2) = 68.7\%; p = 0.000). Further subgroup analysis were performed from methodological differences, especially dose and timing of treatments. Furthermore, melatonin reduced cerebral edema by an SMD of -0.78 (95\% CI: -1.23, -0.34; p = 0.001) with low heterogeneity. In conclusion, melatonin treatment significantly improves both behavioral and pathological outcomes in animal models of ICH. In addition, the results should be interpreted in light of the limitations in experimental design and methodological quality of the studies included in the meta-analysis.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) transplantation is a promising treatment strategy for pulmonary fibrosis. Although encouraging results have been obtained using animal models of bleomycin (BLM)-induced pulmonary fibrosis, it is evident that transplantation of BMSCs at various time-points after BLM administration has produced different results in terms of treatment efficacy. To shed light on the potential utility of BMSCs for the treatment of lung disease, the present study performed a meta-analysis to estimate the efficacy of BMSCs in animal models of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, and compare early transplantation (BMSCs injected on the same day after administration of BLM) with late transplantation (BMSCs injected on the 14th day after administration of BLM). Relevant studies were retrieved from the MEDLINE, PubMed, Chinese Knowledge Infrastructure and WanFang databases using a comprehensive search approach. A total of 6 studies involving 228 model rats were included. Meta-analysis indicated that early BMSC transplantation was able to prevent or reduce BLM-induced alveolitis and pulmonary fibrosis, while late BMSC transplantation was able to reduce alveolitis, but there was no significant evidence regarding improvement of pulmonary fibrosis. Although BMSC therapy was identified to be generally beneficial in rodent models of BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis, the efficacy of early transplantation appears to be more satisfactory; overall, the efficacy of transplantation of BMSCs at the acute inflammatory phase was more effective compared with that at the chronic fibrosis stage. Of note, regarding alveolitis and pulmonary fibrosis scores after late transplantation of BMSCs, the sensitivity analysis revealed that the scores were less stable; thus, this result must be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, the quality and methodology of the included studies was comparatively low. Therefore, higher-quality and more rigorous studies are required to validate the results of the present meta-analysis in the future.},

With an evidence-based approach, this study investigated and analyzed the performance and degradation properties of biodegradable metals in animal models for bone defect repair to explore their potential clinical translation. Animal studies on bone defect repair with biodegradable metals in comparison with other traditional biomaterials were reviewed. Data was carefully collected after identification of population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design (PICOS), and following the inclusion criteria of biodegradable metals in animal studies. 30 publications on pure Mg, Mg alloys, pure Zn and Zn alloys were finally included after extraction from a collected database of 2543 publications. A qualitative systematic review and a quantitative meta-analysis were performed. Given the heterogeneity in animal model, anatomical site and critical size defect (CSD), biodegradable metals exhibited mixed effects on bone defect repair and degradation in animal studies in comparison with traditional non-degradable metals, biodegradable polymers, bioceramics, and autogenous bone grafts. The results indicated that there were limitations in the experimental design of the included studies, and quality of the evidence presented by the studies was very low. To enhance clinical translation of biodegradable metals, evidence-based research with data validity is needed. Future studies should adopt standardized experimental protocols in investigating the effects of biodegradable metals on bone defect repair with animal models.},

Searches were performed on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Wanfang and CNKI databases for animal experiments comparing loading protocols and the long-term stability of micro-screws. Among 1011 detected papers, 16 studies met the eligibility criteria and were selected for analysis. Most studies showed medium methodological quality for evaluation of micro-screws' long-term stability. Five studies reported that loading would not destroy the long-term stability of micro-screws. Three studies indicated that low-intensity immediate loading or a 3-week minimal healing time was acceptable. Two studies reported that the loading magnitude was a controversial issue with regard to the micro-screws' long-term stability. Two studies suggested that counterclockwise loading could decrease the long-term stability of micro-screws. In conclusion, immediate loading below 100g force, healing time greater than 3 weeks, regular loading below 200g force and a clockwise direction of force supported the long-term stability of micro-screws. Further studies relating to the combination of varying loading conditions will be needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Over the years, mesenchymal stromal (stem) cells (MSCs) have been pre-clinically applied in the treatment of variety kinds of diseases including asthma and chronic lung diseases. Aim of the current study was to systematically review and to conduct meta-analysis on the published studies of MSC treatment in asthma animal models. METHODS: Publications on the MSC and asthma treatment was thoroughly searched in the electronic databases. Statistical analysis was then performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (Version 3). Effect of MSC therapy on asthma model was assessed by Hedges's g with 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs). Random effect model was used due to the heterogeneity between the studies. RESULTS: Meta-analysis of the 32 included studies showed that MSC transplantation was significantly in favor of attenuating lung injury and remodeling (Hedges's g = -9.104 ± 0.951 with 95\% CI: -10.969 ∼ -7.240, P {\textless} 0.001) and airway inflammation (Hedges's g = -4.146 ± 0.688 with 95\% CI: -5.495 ∼ -2.797, P {\textless} 0.001). The mechanism of MSC therapy in asthma seems to be regulating the balance of Th1 cytokine and Th2 cytokines (IFN-γ: Hedges's g = 4.779 ± 1.408 with 95\% CI: 1.099-2.725, P {\textless} 0.001; IL-4: Hedges's g = -10.781 ± 1.062 with 95\% CI: -12.863 ∼ -8.699, P {\textless} 0.001; IL-5: Hedges's g = -10.537 ± 1.269 with 95\% CI: -13.025 ∼ -8.050, P {\textless} 0.001; IL-13: Hedges's g = -6.773 ± 0.788 with 95\% CI: -8.318 ∼ -5.229, P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSION: Findings of the current systemic review suggested a potential role for MSCs in asthma treatment although it is still challenging in clinical practice. The mechanisms of MSCs in pre-clinical asthma treatment may be associated with attenuating airway inflammation through regulating Th1 and Th2 cytokines.},

	abstract = {Brucellosis is one of the most common zoonoses worldwide, causing huge economic losses in the animal industry and posing a serious threat to human health. Although the World Health Organization (WHO) and World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) has recommended strategies or measures to control or eradicate brucellosis, only some developed countries have achieved freedom from animal brucellosis. In developing countries, brucellosis remains a serious problem, and the importance of its control has attracted little attention. The strategies and measures are difficult to implement effectively in countries with limited resources because the eradication of brucellosis is an expensive, time-consuming and labor-intensive project. Therefore, more effort is needed to explore the appropriate strategies and measures in developing countries. In this study, we collected the available publications regarding brucellosis control or eradication programs in different countries and areas, and summarized the main strategies and measures, supplementary measures, effects, and lessons learned during their implementation. Results showed that the freedom from animal brucellosis was only achieved in three countries among the 23 included countries and areas after the implementation of the programs, which had lasted several decades. Either alone or together, vaccination and test-and-slaughter programs can effectively reduce brucellosis prevalence. Supplementary measures involve a number of aspects, and their effective implementation is crucial to the success of disease control and cannot be ignored. While disease control or eradication requires extensive resources, some studies have shown that a well-designed and well-implemented disease control or eradication program is economically effective. Experience has revealed that even if significant results have been achieved, the project could not be terminated without careful consideration due to the potential for recurrence.},

Awareness and knowledge of brucellosis among occupational workers is considered an important aspect of brucellosis control in both humans and animals. The aim of this study was to explore the distributions of the pooled awareness level and the knowledge level of the disease worldwide. METHODS: A meta-analysis was carried out to obtain pooled brucellosis awareness levels and knowledge levels of respondents regarding the zoonotic nature of brucellosis, mode of brucellosis transmission, and brucellosis symptoms in animals and humans. The analysis was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses guidelines. RESULTS: A total of seventy-nine original articles reporting the brucellosis awareness levels of in populations from 22 countries were assessed. The total pooled awareness level of brucellosis was 55.5\%, and the pooled awareness levels regarding the zoonotic nature of brucellosis, mode of brucellosis transmission, signs of human brucellosis and signs of animal brucellosis were 37.6\%, 35.9\%, 41.6\%, and 28.4\% respectively. The pooled awareness level was higher than the brucellosis-related knowledge level. Subgroup analyses showed that no obvious differences in brucellosis awareness levels between high-risk populations in Asia and Africa. Health workers (including human health workers and veterinarians) had the greatest overall awareness and knowledge of human brucellosis. The overall awareness levels and knowledge levels of livestock owners (farmers) and herders were higher than those of dairy farmers and abattoir workers. In addition, awareness and knowledge levels were higher among people who were involved in bovine, caprine and ovine animal production or in caprine and ovine animal production than among people who were involved in only bovine animal production. CONCLUSIONS: Insufficient awareness and knowledge of brucellosis were observed in the original studies conducted mainly in Asia and Africa. Interventions to improve public knowledge about brucellosis are urgently needed.},

And relative risks (RRs) for survival rate were calculated. A fixed-effect model was selected to pool and a forest plot was used to display RRs. RESULTS: Four studies involving 394 animals were finally included. Nine control groups are used to pool. A fixed-effect model was applied to estimate a pooled RR of 2.19 (95\% CI: 1.74-2.76), indicating that PD-1 related blockade increased survival rate in sepsis animals.

Finally,20 animal experiment studies were included. According to Metaanalysis. For cellular immunity,GFP could effectively enhance the proliferation of effect or T cells,natural killer cells and macrophages in mice. The percentage of CD4+T cells( MD = 1. 89,95\% CI [0. 94,2. 83],P \&lt; 0. 000 1),CD8+T cells( MD = 8. 46,95\% CI[5. 93,11. 00],P\&lt;0. 000 1),NK cells( MD= 2. 67,95\% CI [0. 23,5. 11],P= 0. 03),and macrophages( MD= 14. 09,95\% CI[0. 84,27. 34],P= 0. 04) were all higher than those in control group. For humoral immunity,GFP could increase the secretion of TNF-α and INF-γ． The secretion of TNF-α( SMD = 15. 92,95\% CI [9. 07,22. 76],P\&lt;0. 000 1) and INF-γ( SMD = 5. 34,95\% CI[3. 42,7. 26],P\&lt;0. 000 1) were all higher than those in control group. In conclusion,GFP could regulate immunologic function by enhancing the proliferation activity of immune cells( CD4+T cells,CD8+T cells,NK cells and macrophages) and the secretion of immune factors( TNF-α and INF-γ) ． However,it is necessary to further standardize the selection of specific surface markers of immune cells and the administration of GFP,in order to reduce the heterogeneity among the studies. At the same time,more attention shall be paid to experimental design,implementation and full report,especially to the establishment and implementation of animal experimental registration system,so as to improve the transparency and quality of the whole process of animal experimental research,enhance the value of basic research ultimately,and provide a reliable theoretical basis for the transformation of basic research into clinical research.},

	abstract = {Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a group of environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). According to recent studies, the associations between PBDEs and rodent male reproductive system are controversial. Therefore, we performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the effects of PBDEs on rodent male reproductive system. Data were extracted from articles collected from PubMed, Web of Science, and other databases. The pooled standard mean deviation (SMD) with 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) was used to evaluate the association between the male rodent reproductive system impairment and PBDE exposure. Ten articles were included in the present meta-analysis and systematic review. The summary SMD of reproductive toxicity associated with PBDEs was -0.46 (95\% CI: -0.69, -0.22), and the overall association between DE-71 along with BDE-209 and male reproductive system damage was statistically significant (SMD = -0.7 95\% CI: -1.18, -0.21, p = .041; SMD = -0.41, 95\% CI: -0.77, -0.05, p = .000). The adverse impact of PBDEs on rodent male reproductive system, especially seminal vesicle (SMD = -1.09, 95\% CI: -1.49, -0.49, p = .523) and ventral prostate (SMD = -1.27, 95\% CI: -1.88, -0.65, p = .821), were clearly demonstrated. Moderate (SMD = -0.81, 95\% CI: -1.182, -0.437, p = .197) and high (SMD = -0.41, 95\% CI: -0.76, -0.05, p = .000) dosage may have exerted effect than relatively low (SMD = -0.29, 95\% CI: -0.17, 0.12, p = .136) dosage.

	abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii, is one of the most important foodborne zoonotic pathogens, which can infect virtually all warm-blooded animals, including pigs, and causes severe illness in congenitally infected infants and even death in patients with AIDS. Pigs (Sus scrofa) are one of the most important intermediate hosts of T. gondii, and human transmission occurs through consumption of raw or poorly cooked pork. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Chongqing VIP, Wanfang, Chinese Web of Knowledge, PubMed, and ScienceDirect databases for published papers regarding Toxoplasma infection in pigs in China, from inception to Oct 29, 2017. Search strings included whether they reported the samples of more than 30 pigs and provided information that allowed us to establish the prevalence of Toxoplasma infection. Moreover, we excluded repeated studies, reviews, other host studies, as well as studies with inconsistent data, incomplete information, those that only provided prevalence data, and those outside of Mainland China. We extracted the numbers of pigs with Toxoplasma infection from the obtained studies, and calculated the pooled prevalence of Toxoplasma infection in the pigs using a random-effects model. The data of 44 articles (including data on 46,723 pigs) were compliant with the standards. The pooled prevalence of T. gondii infection in pigs in China was 29\% (95\% CI 24-34), with 25\% (95\% CI 18-32) in pigs sampled before 2010 and 28\% (95\% CI 21-36) in pigs sampled in 2010 or later. The pooled prevalence of T. gondii in pigs from Northeast China (20\%, 95\% CI 14-26) was significantly lower than those from other regions (North China: 40\%, 95\% CI 32-47; Northwest China: 32\%, 95\% CI 13-51; East China: 30\%, 95\% CI 20-41; and South China: 35\%, 95\% CI 26-45; Central China: 23\%, 95\% CI 14-31; Southwest China: 33\%, 95\% CI 15-52). The estimated pooled prevalence of T. gondii infection was 36\% (95\% CI 25-47, 8,018/21,892) in pigs tested by ELISA, 24\% (95\% CI 19-28, 4,304/18,608) in pigs examined by IHA, and 19\% (95\% CI 8-31, 1,041/6,223) in pigs detected by other methods. Moreover, 1202 of 7470 piglets were detected as T. gondii-positive, and the prevalence (17\%) was lower than that in fattening pigs (25\%, OR = 1.28), sows (34\%, OR = 2.13), and breeding boars (35\%, OR = 2.46). Our findings suggested that toxoplasmosis is common in pigs in Mainland China. It is necessary to monitor the prevalence of T. gondii in pigs, and powerful and effective regulatory measures should be undertaken to reduce human exposure to T. gondii via the consumption of pork.},

	volume = {7},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several clinical studies have evaluated the use of tralokinumab (CAT-354) administration in patients with moderate to severe asthma; no consensus on tralokinumab efficacy and safety was reached. Thus, further analysis is required on the efficacy and safety of tralokinumab as an asthma biologic. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous injection of tralokinumab in patients with moderate to severe asthma. METHODS: Clinical trials were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov from their inception to November 4, 2018. Only randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with tralokinumab versus placebo treatment in patients with moderate to severe asthma were evaluated. Efficacy and safety outcomes were extracted, and a meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. The Cochrane Collaboration's risk-of-bias assessment tool was used to assess the risk of bias. RESULTS: Five studies describing 6 RCTs (including 2928 adults with moderate to severe asthma) were pooled and analyzed in this study. Absolute FEV(1) was statistically improved in patients receiving tralokinumab at 300 mg every 2 weeks (mean difference [MD], 0.14 L; 95\% CI, 0.08-0.21) and 600 mg every 2 weeks (MD, 0.20 L; 95\% CI, 0.01-0.39), as well as FEV(1)\% changes (MD, 5.82\%, 95\% CI, 3.58-8.06, and MD, 11.8\%, 95\% CI, 0.79-22.81, respectively). Also, absolute forced vital capacity volume changes (MD, 0.11 L; 95\% CI, 0.01-0.21) and percentage changes (MD, 4.44\%; 95\% CI, 0.84-8.04) improved in tralokinumab at 300 mg every 2 weeks. Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire scores were not significantly different, and absolute Asthma Control Questionnaire 6 scores were statistically improved but did not reach the clinically meaningful difference. Tralokinumab treatment did not decrease annualized asthma exacerbation rate in unselected patients with moderate to severe asthma, but it was associated with improved annualized asthma exacerbation rate in patients with severe asthma with high fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels (rate ratio, 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.53-0.97). Tralokinumab was not associated with an increased incidence of serious adverse events, but it did show an increase in mild injection-site reactions (odds ratio, 5.92; 95\% CI, 1.61-21.76). CONCLUSION: This pooled analysis of 6 RCTs suggested that tralokinumab was well tolerated and it modestly improved FEV(1) and forced vital capacity in patients with moderate to severe asthma. It did not render clinically important improvements in asthma-related quality of life, and nor did it reduce asthma exacerbations.},

Methods: A comprehensive literature search in the databases of PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase (up to September 2020), was conducted to identify the prospective cohort studies concerning the associations of fish and omega-3 fatty acids consumption with the risk of VTE. The pooled relative risk (RR) of VTE for the highest vs. lowest category of fish and omega-3 fatty acids consumption, as well as their corresponding 95\% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Results: A total of seven articles with eight prospective cohort studies were included. Specifically, six studies were related to fish consumption, and the overall multi-variable adjusted RR showed no significant relationship between fish consumption and the risk of VTE (RR = 1.02, 95\% CI: 0.93-1.11; P = 0.709). In the four studies related to omega-3 fatty acids consumption, the overall multi-variable adjusted RR suggested that omega-3 fatty acids consumption was associated with a lower risk of VTE (RR = 0.89, 95\% CI: 0.80-0.98; P = 0.024). Moreover, two studies were related to recurrent VTE, and the overall multi-variable adjusted RR demonstrated a significant inverse association between omega-3 fatty acids consumption and the risk of recurrent VTE (RR = 0.45, 95\% CI: 0.25-0.81; P = 0.008). Conclusion: Although current evidence is still insufficient to demonstrate any relationship between fish consumption and the risk of VTE, omega-3 fatty acids consumption seems to be associated with a lower risk of both VTE and recurrent VTE. Further large well-designed prospective cohort studies are warranted to elaborate the issues examined in this study.},

We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang and Chongqing VIP databases for studies published between 1976 and 2020 that are related to the prevalence of C. sinensis metacercariae in fish. Studies were screened with keywords based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Seventy-one eligible articles were identified, covering three countries: China, Korea and Vietnam. The pooled prevalence of C. sinensis metacercariae in fish from South-East Asia was 30.5\%, with 35.1\% in China, 29.7\% in Korea and 8.4\% in Vietnam. In subgroup analyses of climate, season, water source and publication date, the highest prevalence was identified in the Dwb climate type (43.3\%), summer (70.2\%), river (34.5\%) and pre-2001 publications (38.9\%), respectively. In comparison, the lowest prevalence was found in the Dfa climate type (14.5\%), winter (19.5\%), lake (8.0\%) and post-2001 publications (23.8\%). Meta-regression results indicated that country (p = .009), the published time (p = .035) and water source subgroups (p = .003) may be the source of heterogeneity.

Various nanoscale delivery systems have been developed for improving its bioavailability. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of nanoscale delivery systems on improving lutein bioavailability in rodent models. Using EBSCOhost and PubMed, a total of eleven peer-reviewed articles published from 2000 to 2020 were identified. Plasma lutein concentration, pharmacokinetic parameters, including maximum concentration (C(max)), area under curve (AUC), and time to reach the maximum concentration (T(max)), and lutein accumulation in organs were extracted to evaluate the bioavailability of lutein using nanoscale delivery methods as compared with unencapsulated or raw lutein. Various nanoscale delivery systems, including polymer nanoparticles, emulsions, and lutein nanoparticles, significantly improved the bioavailability of lutein, as evidenced by increased plasma lutein concentrations, C(max), or AUC. Additionally, five out of seven studies observed enhanced accumulation of lutein in the liver and the eyes. Polymer nanoparticles and emulsions improve the dispersibility and stability of lutein, thus lutein might be more accessible in the small intestine. Lutein nanoparticles shortened the T(max). Further studies are warranted to evaluate the effectiveness of nanoscale delivery systems on improving the functionalities of lutein.},

Even though commercial antimicrobial interventions in meat industries are overall efficient to eliminate bacterial contamination, the capability of antibiotic resistant bacteria of resisting to antimicrobial interventions, compared to the susceptible bacterial population, was not fully understood. The aim of this study was to compare the impacts of various antimicrobial interventions used for beef processing on antibiotic resistant and susceptible strains of Salmonella and Escherichia coli. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify, evaluate and summarize primary research that provide quantitative information about the efficacy of various antimicrobial interventions in reducing antibiotic resistant and susceptible bacterial contamination of raw beef products. Eleven citations (of 409) were determined to be relevant to address the question (nine citations for Salmonella and two for Escherichia coli) and eligible for data extraction and subsequent meta-analysis. Through the comprehensive search, data for five categories of antimicrobial interventions, including acid, oxidizer, physical, thermal treatments, and others, were summarized. Ratio of the efficacy of eliminating antibiotic resistant to susceptible contamination by a specific intervention was calculated, showing most of efficacy ratios were around 1.0. The results indicate that the efficacy of antimicrobial interventions commonly used during beef processing in reducing bacteria is not affected by their antibiotic resistant profiles.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) relieves pain by creating a relaxed and comfortable environment to reduce anxiety in children. Yet little is known about its effects on pain in children. This study aims to systematically evaluate the effects of AAT on pain in children. METHODS: Eight databases including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL Complete, Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), Weipu Database (VIP), China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (CNKI) and Wanfang Database were retrieved, and all randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trial using AAT on children's pain were recruited from inception to October 2019. Two reviewers independently screened literature, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. RevMan 5.3 software was employed for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Seven published studies containing 4 RCTs and 3 CCTs were included for the systematic review. The results of meta-analysis showed that AAT could reduce children's pain when compared with the control group [MD = -0.53, 95\% CI (-0.77, -0.30), P {\textless} 0.00001]. CONCLUSION: Current evidence shows that AAT can relieve pain in children to some extent. Considering the limited quality and quantity of the available studies, more high quality studies should be performed to verify the above conclusion.},

	abstract = {The current study was to evaluate the predicted role of dietary fresh fish and processed fish intake for risk of glioma. Databases of Web of Science, PubMed, and Wan Fang Med Online were retrieved up to Jan 31th, 2018. Eligible studies were identified based on defined inclusion criteria. Summarized results of relative risk (RR) with corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random effects model. Sensitivity analysis and publication bias were also performed. The final analysis in this report included a total of 9 articles. The summarized RR and 95\%CI from 8 studies for dietary fresh fish intake and glioma risk was 0.823 (95\%CI= 0.698-0.970), with no evidence of significant between-study heterogeneity (I2=43.6\%, P=0.088). Moreover, positive associations were also found both in Caucasian populations and Asia populations. Seven studies were used to assess the relationship between dietary processed fish intake and the risk of glioma. Significantly increased risk of glioma was found for the highest category of dietary processed fish intake [summarized RR= 1.554, 95\%CI= 1.169-2.066, I2= 72.1\%, P= 0.001], especially among Caucasian populations. No publication bias was found. In summary, findings from this meta-analysis concluded that dietary fresh fish intake could reduce the risk of glioma. However, very high processed fish intake had a significant association with increased glioma risk.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vascular dementia is the second most common type of dementia that causes cognitive dysfunction. Acupuncture, an ancient therapy, has been mentioned for the treatment of vascular dementia in previous studies. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of acupuncture in animal models of vascular dementia. METHODS: Experimental animal studies of treating vascular dementia with acupuncture were gathered from Embase, PubMed and Ovid Medline (R) from the dates of the databases' creation to December 2016. We adopted the CAMARADES 10-item checklist to evaluate the quality of the included studies. The Morris water maze test was considered as an outcome measure. The software Stata12.0 was used for the meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was examined using I(2) statistics, and we conducted subgroup analyses to determine the causes of heterogeneity for escape latency and duration in original platform. RESULTS: Sixteen studies involving 363 animals met the inclusion criteria. The included studies scored between 4 and 8 points, and the mean was 5.44. The results of the meta-analysis indicated remarkable differences with acupuncture on increasing the duration in the former platform quadrant both in EO models (SMD = 1.56, 95\% CI: 1.02 {\textasciitilde} 2.11; p {\textless} 0.00001) and 2-VO models (SMD 4.29, 95\% CI 3.23 {\textasciitilde} 5.35; p {\textless} 0.00001) compared with the control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture may be effective in improving cognitive function in vascular dementia animal models. The mechanisms of acupuncture for vascular dementia are multiple such as anti-apoptosis, antioxidative stress reaction, and metabolism enhancing of glucose and oxygen.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used subject and free words to search PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. The risk-of-bias evaluation tool was used to assess literature quality. Data merging and statistical analyses were carried out using Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 13.0. All indicators were expressed as the mean difference (MD) and 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI). The heterogeneity test was conducted according to I(2) and Q tests. We used Egger's test to evaluate publication bias quantitatively. RESULTS: This was a meta-analysis of intervention trials. Thirty-two studies (1562 patients) were included. The quality of the included studies was acceptable. Compared with consumption of animal protein, plant protein reduced total cholesterol (TC) (MD = - 0.19 mmol/L, 95\% CI - 0.26, - 0.12), triglyceride (MD = - 0.07 mmol/L, 95\% CI - 0.13, - 0.02), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (MD = - 0.19 mmol/L, 95\% CI - 0.26, - 0.13), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD = - 0.05 mmol/L, 95\% CI - 0.09, - 0.01), TC/LDL-C ratio (MD = - 0.17, 95\% CI - 0.32, - 0.02) and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio (MD = - 0.20, 95\% CI - 0.33, - 0.06) significantly and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (MD = 0.03 mmol/L, 95\% CI 0.01, 0.06) levels, but had no effect on BW (MD = - 0.41 kg, 95\% CI - 2.14, 1.33) or BMI (MD = 0.11 kg/m(2), 95\% CI - 0.51, 0.73).

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inconsistent results of the association between fish consumption and stroke risk have been indicated in previous epidemiological studies. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to estimate the impact of fish consumption on stroke risk. METHODS: The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched through a computer search. Prospective cohort studies satisfying predetermined inclusion criterion were included. Random-effect model was adopted in this meta-analysis. Analysis of subgroup, sensitivity, publication bias, dose-response, power, and quality of evidence was also conducted. RESULTS: Thirty one publications including 33 independent prospective cohort studies were identified in this meta-analysis. In the primary analysis of the highest versus lowest categories of fish consumption, pooled results indicated that a significant trend toward an inverse association between fish intake and stroke risk (HR = .90, 95\% confidence interval [CI] .85-.96). Further subgroup analyses indicated an inverse association was more pronounced in the group of hemorrhagic stroke (HR=.88, 95\% CI .80-.96), female (HR =.83, 95\% CI .75-.92), and Asia-Pacific (HR = .87, 95\% CI .80-.95). Both the funnel plot and Egger tests suggested no evidence of publication bias. Dose-response analysis showed a linear relationship between fish intake and stroke and the risk of stroke decreased by 2\%-12\% with increasing intake of fish up to 100-700 g/week. According to the NutriGrade scoring system, the level of metaevidence quality was moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Based on current evidence from prospective cohort studies, we concluded that fish consumption was associated with a decreased risk of stroke.},

A meta-analysis of survival rates revealed a significant advantage of RAGE inhibition in comparison with controls (HR 0.67, 95\% CI 0.52-0.86). This effect was most pronounced in polymicrobial infection (HR 0.28, 95\% CI 0.14-0.55), followed by Gram positive (G(+)) bacterial infection (HR 0.70, 95\% CI 0.50-0.97) and Gram negative (G(-)) bacterial infection (HR 0.89, 95\% CI 0.58-1.38). For G(+) bacterial infection, RAGE inhibition decreased bacterial outgrowth and dissemination, inflammatory cell influx, plasma cytokine levels, and pulmonary injury.

	abstract = {Interleukin (IL)-33 is a member of the IL-1 family of proteins that have multiple roles in organ-specific inflammation. Many studies suggest diagnostic and therapeutic implications of this cytokine. Many studies have reported pro-inflammatory roles for IL-33 in innate immune responses involving the heart and lung. Recent studies also describe pro-inflammatory and regulatory roles for IL-33 in the pathogenesis of brain and liver disorders in addition to regulatory roles for this cytokine in the heart and lung. In this focused systematic review, we will review the literature regarding pro-inflammatory and regulatory effects of IL-33 in the brain and liver. We will also assess the potential risk of bias in the published literature in order to uncover gaps in the knowledge that will be useful for the scientific community. We utilized guidelines set by preferred reporting items for systemic reviews and meta-analyses. The electronic database was PubMed. Eligibility criteria included organ-specific inflammation in mice and humans, organ-specific inflammation in the central nervous and hepatic systems, and IL-33. Outcomes were pro-inflammatory or regulatory effects of IL-33. Risk of bias in individual studies and across studies was addressed by adapting the Cochrane Rob 2.0 tool. We discovered that a source of bias across the studies was a lack of randomization in human studies. Additionally, because the majority of studies were performed in mice, this could be perceived as a potential risk of bias. Regarding the central nervous system, roles for IL-33 in the development and maturation of neuronal circuits were reported; however, exact mechanisms by which this occurred were not elucidated. IL-33 was produced by astrocytes and endothelial cells while IL-33 receptors were expressed by microglia and astrocytes, demonstrating that these cells are first responders for IL-33; however, in the CNS, IL-33 seems to induce Th1 cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF-α chemokines such as RANTES, MCP-1, MIP-1α, and IP-10, as well as nitric oxide. In the liver, similar risks of bias were determined because of the lack of randomized controlled trials in humans and because the majority of studies were performed in mice. Interestingly, the strain of mouse utilized in the study seemed to affect the role of IL-33 in liver inflammation. Lastly, similar to the brain, IL-33 appeared to have ST2-independent regulatory functions in the liver. Our results reveal plausible gaps in what is known regarding IL-33 in the pathogenesis of brain and liver disorders. We highlight key studies in the lung and heart as examples of advancements that likely occurred because of countless basic and translational studies in this area. More research is needed in these areas in order to assess the diagnostic or therapeutic potential of IL-33 in these disorders.},

A total of 19 studies were included for analysis in our study. Results indicated that the sperm count of rats exposed to fenvalerate was lower than that of rats in control groups. The sperm count, sperm motility, and testosterone level of rats exposed to cypermethrin and deltamethrin were lower than those of rats in control groups. Moreover, the sperm morphology of rats exposed to these pyrethroid pesticides was abnormal compared with that of rats in control groups. The present meta-analysis indicates that pyrethroid pesticides decrease rat sperm count, sperm motility, and testosterone level and cause abnormal rat sperm morphology. Therefore, pyrethroid pesticides can damage the testis of male rats.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The decision to apply simple water-seal drainage or the addition of an external suction to the simple water-seal drainage following pulmonary surgery is made based on the surgeon's experience or preference and has remained controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to assess the effects of the addition of suction to simple water-seal on the postoperative outcomes. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched from their inception to 30 August 2017. The risk ratio and the weight mean difference were calculated for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively, each with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). The heterogeneity and risk of bias were also assessed. RESULTS: A total of 10 randomized controlled trials enrolling 1601 patients were included. Overall, compared with simple water-seal, the addition of external suction reduced the occurrence of postoperative pneumothorax (risk ratio 0.35, 95\% CI 0.13-0.93; P = 0.04) and other cardiopulmonary complications (risk ratio 0.65, 95\% CI 0.48-0.89; P = 0.008), and increased the duration of chest tube drainage (weight mean difference 0.92 days, 95\% CI 0.04-1.81, P = 0.04). However, the effect difference between the 2 groups was not significant regarding air leak duration, length of hospital stay and the occurrence of prolonged air leak. The stability of these studies was strong. No evidence of publication bias was detected. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of suction to simple water-seal made no difference to air leak duration, hospital stay or the occurrence of prolonged air leak following pulmonary surgery. In patients where there is concern about a residual or increasing pneumothorax, the addition of suction may be applied selectively.},

	abstract = {Sepsis may directly lead to multiple organ failure, which is among the leading causes of mortality in critically ill patients. According to data released by the Global Sepsis Alliance, the number of mortalities due to sepsis exceeded the combined number for prostate cancer, breast cancer and AIDS in 2012. To date, studies have reported that resveratrol has marked positive effects including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and pro-microcirculatory functions in sepsis-induced organ injury, significantly improving the survival time and mortality of sepsis animals. The present systematic review sought to further clarify the efficacy and safety of resveratrol in the treatment of sepsis. Studies on resveratrol application in the treatment of sepsis-induced organ injury in animal models were reviewed by searching various Chinese and other language databases (PubMed, Embase, CNKI, WanFang and WeiPu) and by manually searching the references of related articles. The selection and evaluation of the studies was performed by two independent reviewers. A total of 260 related studies were initially identified. Following application of the exclusion factors and inclusion criteria, 11 studies were included. Meta-analysis revealed that resveratrol exerted significant protective effect in sepsis-induced animal models of organ injury, through anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and pro-microcirculatory functions compared with in the placebo group. While nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (NRF-2) are the two major signaling pathways to have been associated with the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects of resveratrol, these factors were not quantified for mean values, therefore not suitable for systematic evaluation. For related factors, the results of meta-analysis were as follows: For tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), the standardized mean difference (SMD) was -13.50 [95\% confidence interval (CI): -22.08, -4.91; P=0.002]; for malondialdehyde (MDA), the SMD was -3.10 (95\% CI: -5.27, -0.93; P=0.005); for mean arterial pressure the SMD was 1.34 (95\% CI: 0.07, 2.62; P=0.04); for interleukin (IL)-6 the SMD was -9.57 (95\% CI: -20.90, 1.75; P=0.10); and for IL-10 the SMD was 0.80 (95\% CI: -0.73, 2.34; P=0.31). It was concluded that resveratrol exerted significant anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects through NF-κB and NRF-2 signaling pathways in animal models of sepsis-induced multiple organ injury, manifesting as significant downregulation of TNF-α and MDA expression and improved microcirculation, therefore ameliorating septic damage to the body, which may ultimately improve survival ratios.},

	abstract = {Background: Brucellosis is one of the most significant zoonosis over the world, threatening both veterinary and human public health. However, few studies were focused on nationwide animal brucellosis and made association with human brucellosis. Methodology and Principal Findings: We conducted a bilingual literature search on Brucella or brucellosis in China on the two largest databases (China National Knowledge Infrastructure and PubMed) and conducted a systematic review. A total of 1,383 Chinese and 81 English publications, published between 1958 and 2018 were identified. From them, 357 publications presenting 692 datasets were subjected to the meta-analysis. The overall prevalence rate is 1.70\% (95\% CI: 1.66-1.74), with a declining (until the late 1990s) and rising trend (starting the early 2000s). Interestingly, the animal with highest prevalence rate is canine (8.35\%, 95\% CI: 7.21-9.50), and lowest in cattle (1.22\%, 95\% CI: 1.17-1.28). The prevalence of Brucella in animals was unequally distributed among the 24 examined regions in China. Conclusions: Brucellosis is a reemerging disease for both humans and animals in China. The observed data suggests that dogs and yaks are the leading reservoirs for Brucella, and the provinces with highest prevalence rates in animals are Hubei, Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, Fujian, and Guizhou. Accordingly targeted intervention policy should be implemented to break the Brucella transmission chain between animals and humans in China.},

	abstract = {Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that has few treatment options. Riluzole, a sodium channel blocker used to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, has been initially trialed in human SCI. We performed a systematic review to critically assess the efficacy of riluzole in locomotor recovery and damage extension in SCI rat models, and the potential for clinical translation. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Chinese databases were searched from their inception date to March 2018. Two reviewers independently selected animal studies that evaluated neurological recovery and lesion area following riluzole treatment in SCI rat models, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Pairwise meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, and network meta-analysis were performed to assess the effects of riluzole on SCI. Ten eligible studies were included. Two studies had high methodological quality. Overall, the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan scores were increased in riluzole-treated animals versus controls, and effect sizes showed a gradual increase from the 1st (five studies, n = 104, mean difference = 1.24, 95\% CI = 0.11 to 2.37, p = 0.03) to 6th week after treatment (five studies, n = 120, mean difference = 2.34, 95\% CI = 1.26 to 3.42, p {\textless} 0.0001). Riluzole was associated with improved outcomes in the inclined plane test and the tissue preservation area. Subgroup analyses suggested an association of locomotor recovery with riluzole dose. Network meta-analysis showed that 5 mg/kg riluzole exhibited greater protection than 2.5 and 8 mg/kg riluzole. Collectively, this review suggests that riluzole has a protective effect on SCI, with good safety and a clear mechanism of action and may be suitable for future clinical trials or applications. However, animal results should be interpreted with caution given the known limitations in animal experimental design and methodological quality.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lupus nephritis is usually manifested by proteinuria, active urinary sediment, hypertension, and renal failure and is a serious complication with more than 50\% occurrence in systemic lupus erythematosus patients. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) present remarkable immunomodulatory ability, and these cells are potential therapeutic agents for autoimmune disorders. In clinical trials, the effectiveness of MSC in the treatment of lupus nephritis is still controversial. A meta-analysis was performed to assess whether MSC can achieve good efficacy in the treatment of lupus nephritis in mice. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed in Cochrane Library, ISI Web of Science, PubMed, and EMBASE from inception to Oct 1, 2019. Two authors independently extracted the data, which were pooled and calculated using RevMan 5.3. RESULTS: A total of 28 studies met the inclusion criteria. MSC treatment resulted in lower levels of ds-DNA (OR = - 29.58, 95\% CI - 29.58, - 17.99; P {\textless} 0.00001), ANA (OR = - 70.93, 95\% CI - 104.55, - 37.32; P {\textless} 0.0001), Scr (OR = - 8.20, 95\% CI - 12.71, - 3.69; P = 0.0004), BUN (OR = - 14.57, 95\% CI - 20.50, - 8.64; P {\textless} 0.00001), proteinuria (OR = - 4.26, 95\% CI - 5.15 to - 3.37; P {\textless} 0.00001), and renal sclerosis score (OR = - 1.92, 95\% CI - 2.66 to - 1.18; P {\textless} 0.00001), and MSC treatment could get higher levels of albumin. To detect the potential, the cytokines were also assessed, and the MSC treatment group had lower levels of IL-2, IL-12, IL-17, and IFN-γ when compared with the control group. However, the difference was not notable for IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TGF-β, MCP-1, TNF-α, Th1, Th17, Foxp3, or Tregs. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that MSC treatment in an animal model for lupus nephritis in the studies included in the meta-analysis resulted in lower levels of ds-DNA, ANA, Scr, BUN, proteinuria, and renal sclerosis score, and MSC treatment could get higher levels of albumin.},

METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review in both English and Chinese search engines. We estimated the pooled odds ratios of biosecurity indicators relating to AI infections at market level using a quality effects (QE) meta-analysis model. RESULTS: Biosecurity measures effective at reducing AI market contamination and poultry infection at LBMs include smaller market size, selling single poultry species and separating different species, performing cleaning and disinfection and market closures, ban on overnight storage, and sourcing poultry from local areas. Our meta-analysis indicates that higher risk of exposure to AI infection occurs in workers at retail LBMs, female workers, and those who contact ducks, conduct cleaning, slaughtering, defeathering, or evisceration. CONCLUSIONS: The most effective strategies to reduce AI market contamination identified in this study should target larger LBMs that are located at noncentral city areas and sell and slaughter multispecies of live poultry.

Previous research has suggested its potentially beneficial effects on diabetic nephropathies. However, its effects and protective mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we conducted a preclinical systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and potential mechanisms of ASIV in reducing kidney damage in diabetes mellitus (DM) models. Studies were searched from nine databases until January 2020. A random-effects model was used to calculate combined standardised mean difference estimates and 95 \% confidence intervals. Risk of bias of studies was assessed using the Systematic Review Center for Laboratory Animal Experimentation risk of bias tool 10-item checklist. RevMan 5.3 software was used for statistical analysis. Twenty-three studies involving 562 animals were included in the meta-analysis. Studies quality scores ranged from 2 to 5. The ASIV group induced a marked decrease in serum creatinine (P {\textless} 0.00001), blood urea nitrogen (P {\textless} 0.00001), 24-h urine protein (P {\textless} 0.00001) and pathological score (P {\textless} 0.001) compared with the control group. The determined potential mechanisms of ASIV action were relieving oxidative stress, delaying renal fibrosis, anti-apoptosis and anti-inflammatory action.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: With increasing use of pharmaceuticals, drug-induced liver injury (DILI) has become a significant therapeutic challenge to physicians all over the world. Drugs based on Schisandra fruits (SF for short, the fruits of Schisandra chinensis or Schisandra sphenanthera) or synthetic analogues of schisandrin C, are commonly prescribed for treating DILI in China. PURPOSE: This review summarizes the literature regarding the application of SF-derived drugs in patients with DILI and current understanding of mechanisms underlying the protective effects of SF against liver injury. METHODS: Keywords related to drug-induced liver injury and Schisandra fruits were searched in the following databases: Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, LiverTox, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Scientific Journal database (VIP), and Wanfang database. All studies, published in English or Chinese, were included. Clinical study exclusion criteria: if patients received other Chinese herbal medicines in a study, the study will not be included in this review. RESULTS: Clinical studies have shown that SF-derived drugs are effective in inhibiting drug-induced elevation of serum levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase and total bilirubin. Cellular and animal studies have demonstrated that crude SF extracts, lignan compounds found in SF, and SF-derived drugs are effective in protecting the liver against xenobiotic-induced injury. Regulation of cytochrome P450 enzyme activity, anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation and acceleration of liver regeneration are involved in the hepatoprotective mechanisms of SF. CONCLUSION: SF-derived drugs are effective in ameliorating DILI in China. To verify the clinical efficacy of these drugs, high-quality clinical studies are needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is an increasing of reports describing the efficacy of neuroprotective small molecule in Parkinson's disease (PD) models. Ideally, the choice of pushing drug candidates to clinical trial should be based on an unbiased assessment of all available data. Systematic review uses a methodical approach to minimize the bias in the selection of studies for inclusion, providing a comprehensive understanding of the drug's effects on multiple animal models with different mechanism. To our knowledge, such assessments of baicalein, which is a candidate neuroprotective drug with efficacy in PD, have not been fully conducted. PURPOSE: To provide a comprehensive understanding of baicalein's effects on different animal models with different mechanism by using a methodical approach to minimize the bias in the selection of studies. METHODS: In this study, we used a systematic review method to comprehensively assess the efficacy of baicalein in animal PD models. By using electronic and manual search for the literatures, we identified studies describing the efficacy of baicalein in animal models of PD. RESULTS: We identified 16 studies describing the efficacy of baicalein in animal models of PD. The methodological quality of all preclinical trials is ranged from 2 to 5. 16 studies involved 4 main kinds of PD animal models. They are MPP+-induced, rotenone-induced, 6-OHDA-induced and acrolein-induced PD models, respectively. The protective effects of baicalein were studied mainly focusing on the anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory action. Beyond that, there are 2 articles describing the effects of baicalein on neurotransmitter balance in the basal ganglia, and 2 articles reporting the effects in decreasing synuclein aggregation. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of baicalein in PD experimental animals and analyzed the pharmacological mechanism. The information will be useful for the further development of baicalein into anti-PD agent and provide unbiased evidence for the conduct of clinical trials. In addition, such evaluation based on animal experiments can give us a general introduction to different animal models of PD, either guiding the further model tests, or avoiding the unnecessary replication.},

Here, we conducted a preclinical systematic review of 15 studies including 577 animals to establish the efficacy and potential mechanisms of AS-IV for animal models of viral myocarditis (VM). Six databases were searched from inception to October 2018. Application of the Cochrane Collaboration's tool 10-item checklist and Rev-Man 5.3 software to analyze risk of bias of studies and data on outcome measures revealed study quality scores ranging from 2 to 5. Compared with the control group, AS-IV induced a marked decrease in mortality (P {\textless} 0.05), inflammation of myocardium and pathological score (P{\textless} 0.05) and cardiac enzymes expression (P{\textless} 0.05), and improved the function of the heart (P{\textless} 0.05). The potential mechanisms of AS-IV action were determined as anti-remodeling of myocardium (n = 1), anti-virus (n = 2), antioxidant (n = 2), anti-inflammatory (n = 6), anti-apoptosis (n = 1) and alleviation of myocardial fibrosis (n = 2). The collective results indicate that AS-IV exerts cardioprotective effects in animals with VM via multiple signaling pathways.},

	abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Ligusticum wallichii has been used to treat renal diseases for thousands of years in China. Ligustrazine (Lig) is the active ingredient of Ligusticum wallichii that possesses a variety of biological activities against kidney disease. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this review is to further evaluate whether the supplementation with Lig has an effect on improving renal pathology, renal function indexes and blood glucose levels in animal model of diabetic nephropathy (DN). Potential mechanisms of Lig for DN as well as the existing problems regarding the modeling method and limitations in this area of research were also summarized. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist was used to organize the search of eight databases from inception to June 2019. We used Cochrane Collaboration's 10-item checklist and Rev-Man 5.3 software to analyze the data as well as risk of bias. RESULTS: The study quality scores ranged from 2 to 6 points with an average of 4.471. Compared with the control group, Lig significantly improved pathological changes of kidney including glomeruli and tubules, and induced significant decreases in levels of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, 24-h urinary albumin and HbA1c, as well as increasing creatinine clearance rates. In subgroup analysis, the groups of high-dose STZ (≥60 mg/kg) and longer period of Lig treatment ({\textgreater}8 w) showed better results than those of the control group. No difference was seen between the high ({\textgreater}150 mg/kg, QD) and low (≤150 mg/kg, QD) dose of Lig treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Lig exerts renoprotective functions in an animal model of DN mediated by antioxidant action, inhibition of apoptosis, anti-inflammatory action, reduction of renal fibrosis, reduction of the proliferation of mesangial cells, inhibition of endotheliosis, inhibition of atherosclerosis and promotion of renal autophagy. The positive conclusion should be treated cautiously because of various methodological flaws. Further studies are recommended according to ARRIVE guidelines. The method of modeling with high-dose STZ should be avoided and improved STZ modeling schemes are recommended. Considering the large dosage range of Lig used clinically and in animals, the future studies on the basis of animal renal histology are urgently needed to determine the optimal dosages to delay histological changes. Nevertheless, together, our findings suggest that Lig is a renoprotective candidate drug for treatment of DN.},

	abstract = {China once suffered greatly from schistosomiasis japonica, a major zoonotic disease. Nearly 70 years of multidisciplinary efforts have achieved great progress in disease control, with infections in both humans and bovines significantly reduced to very low levels. However, reaching for the target of complete interruption of transmission at the country level by 2030 still faces great challenges, with areas of ongoing endemicity and/or re-emergence within previously 'eliminated' regions. The objectives of this study were, by using meta-analytical methods, to estimate the overall prevalence of Schistosoma japonicum infections in abundant commensal rodent species in mainland China after the introduction of praziquantel for schistosomiasis treatment in humans and bovines in 1980s. In doing so we thereby aimed to further assess the role of wild rodents as potential reservoirs in ongoing schistosome transmission. Published studies on infection prevalence of S. japonicum in wild rodents in mainland China since 1980 were searched across five electronic bibliographic databases and lists of article references. Eligible studies were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Risks of within and across study biases, and the variations in prevalence estimates attributable to heterogeneities were assessed. The pooled infection prevalence and its 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation. We identified a total of 37 relevant articles involving 61 field studies which contained eligible data on 8,795 wild rodents across mainland China. The overall pooled infection prevalence was 3.86\% (95\% CI: 2.16-5.93\%). No significant change in the overall pooled prevalence was observed between 1980-2003 (n = 23 studies) and 2004-current (n = 38 studies). However, whilst the estimated prevalence decreased over time in the marshland and lake regions, there was an apparent increase in prevalence within hilly and mountainous regions. Among seven provinces, a significant prevalence reduction was only seen in Jiangsu where most endemic settings are classified as the marshland and lakes. These estimates changed over season, ranging from 0.58\% in spring to 22.39\% in winter, in association with increases in rodent density. This study systematically analyzed S. japonicum infections in wild rodents from the published literature over the last forty years after the introduction of praziquantel for schistosomiasis treatment in humans and bovines in 1980s. Although numbers of schistosomiasis cases in humans and bovines have been greatly reduced, no such comparable overall change of infection prevalence in rodents was detected. Furthermore, there appeared to be an increase in S. japonicum prevalence in rodents over time within hilly and mountainous regions. Rodents have been projected to become the dominant wildlife in human-driven environments and the main reservoir of zoonotic diseases in general within tropical zones. Our findings thus suggest that it is now necessary to include monitoring and evaluation of potential schistosome infection within rodents, particularly in hilly and mountainous regions, if we are ever to reach the new 2030 elimination goals and to maximize the impact of future public, and indeed One Health, interventions across, regional, national and international scales.},

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide and has complicated underlying pathophysiology. Numerous TBI animal models have been developed over the past decade to effectively mimic the human TBI pathophysiology. These models are of mostly mammalian origin including rodents and non-human primates. However, the mammalian models demanded higher costs and have lower throughput often limiting the progress in TBI research. Thus, this systematic review aims to discuss the potential benefits of non-mammalian TBI models in terms of their face validity in resembling human TBI. Three databases were searched as follows: PubMed, Scopus, and Embase, for original articles relating to non-mammalian TBI models, published between January 2010 and December 2019. A total of 29 articles were selected based on PRISMA model for critical appraisal. Zebrafish, both larvae and adult, was found to be the most utilized non-mammalian TBI model in the current literature, followed by the fruit fly and roundworm. In conclusion, non-mammalian TBI models have advantages over mammalian models especially for rapid, cost-effective, and reproducible screening of effective treatment strategies and provide an opportunity to expedite the advancement of TBI research.},

	abstract = {Background  Bleeding is a feared adverse event during anticoagulant treatment. In patients on vitamin K antagonists, most bleedings occur with the international normalized ratio (INR) in the therapeutic range. Currently, identification of high-risk patients via laboratory methods is not reliable. In this systematic review, we assessed the ability of calibrated automated thrombin generation (CAT-TG) to predict bleeding in patients on anticoagulant treatment. Methods  A systematic search was executed in three databases: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane. Results  Seven studies were included; two were of good methodological quality. One study showed that patients on warfarin with INRs in range (2-3) admitted for hemorrhage ( n  = 28), had lower CAT-TG levels (endogenous thrombin potential [ETP]: 333 ± 89 nM/min) than patients on warfarin admitted for other reasons (ETP: 436 ± 207 nM/min; p  {\textless} 0.001). Another study found no difference in ETP or peak levels between bleeding and nonbleeding patients in PPP or PRP. When measured in whole blood, both levels were significantly lower in patients with bleeding compared with nonbleeding patients (median [interquartile range, IQR] ETP: 182.5 [157.2-2,847 nM/min] vs. median [IQR] ETP: 256.2 [194.9-344.2 nM/min]; p  {\textless} 0.001) and median [IQR] peak: 23.9 [19.6-41.8 nM] vs. median [IQR] peak: 39.1 [24.9-53.2 nM]; p  {\textless} 0.05). From the remaining studies, four suggested that CAT-TG is more sensitive in detecting hemostatic abnormalities than INR and one article found ETP and INR to be equally useful. However, insufficient data were provided to validate these conclusions. Conclusion  Studies investigating the direct association between decreased CAT-TG values and hemorrhagic events are rare. Therefore, the clinical consequences of low CAT-TG values remain to be further investigated.},

An analytical data set was constructed from 72 different studies from 37 countries with two types of production systems: a conventional production system (CPS) and an organic production system (OPS) compared with commercially available or retail-store-available milk (COM). Results of the meta-analytical study showed differences in the concentrations of macrominerals. Concentrations of Ca, Mg, K, and P were greater in the CPS samples, whereas Na was greater in the COM samples ( P {\textless} 0.05). Data also demonstrated that concentrations of microminerals like Cu, I, Fe, Mn, Se, and Zn in the organic WRM were lower ( P {\textless} 0.05) compared with the milk from CPS. The highest concentration of Ni was reported for COM ( P {\textless} 0.05); however, this value was below the minimum-risk level (MRL). Concentrations of heavy metals like As and Ni were greater in CPS milk than those in organic milk ( P {\textless} 0.05). In addition, there were greater concentrations of Cd and Pb in the WRM from CPS versus that from the organic farms. Concentration of Al was lowest in the OPS milk versus Al in the CPS which was 6.5-fold greater than in organic milk. The amount of Hg was below the MRL of 0.01 μmol/L for all production systems. A high variability was observed in the published data regarding the country of origin. Raw milk originating from Europe and North America was characterized by concentrations of macro- and microminerals below the MRLs as compared with that from specific countries, which had some minerals above the MRLs. For example, concentrations of Pb were above the MRL in the milk samples from Brazil, Croatia, Egypt, Mexico, Nigeria, Palestine, Romania, Serbia, and Turkey. Moreover, data from this study indicate that organic dairy farms are characterized by lower concentrations of toxic heavy metals in the WRM compared with those from CPS dairy farms.},

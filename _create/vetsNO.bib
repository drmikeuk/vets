	abstract = {The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of antifungal treatments for Malassezia dermatitis in dogs and, when possible, to propose recommendation for or against their use. Electronic searches were carried out using PubMed MEDLINE(R), CABDirect and CONSULTANT database. The volumes of Advances in Veterinary Dermatology, the proceedings of ESVD/ECVD and AAVD/ACVD congresses were hand-searched for studies relevant to this review. All articles and book chapters discussing treatment of Malassezia dermatitis were scanned for additional citations. Lastly, a request was sent to the Vetderm Listserv to share recent clinical trials. The analysis evaluated study design, methodology quality, subject enrolment quality, type of interventions and outcome measures. The searches identified 35 articles, and 14 trials that fulfilled the following selection criteria: (i) in vivo clinical trials, (ii) dogs showing clinical lesions of Malassezia dermatitis and (iii) enrolment of at least five dogs. Among these, only eight studies fulfilled the following additional criterion: (iv) prospective in vivo clinical trials reporting clinical and mycological outcome measures. A total number of 14 different treatment protocols included four blinded, randomized and controlled trials (quality of evidence grade A), four controlled studies lacking blinding and/or randomization (grade B), five open uncontrolled trials (grade C) and one descriptive study (grade D). This systematic review allowed us to recommend, with good evidence, the use of only one topical treatment of Malassezia dermatitis (2\% miconazole nitrate +2\% chlorhexidine, twice a week for 3 weeks) and with fair evidence the use of two systemic treatments with azole derivatives (ketoconazole, 10 mg kg(-1) day(-1) and itraconazole, 5 mg kg(-1) day(-1) for 3 weeks).},

	abstract = {Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is an important reproductive pathogen of cattle worldwide. The reproductive outcome of BVDV infection is largely dependent on the immune status of the dam and the stage of gestation at the time of infection. Potential sequelae include failure of conception, abortion, a variety of congenital malformations, and fetal infection. Vaccination is a possible tool in the control of BVDV, and there has been a recently renewed focus on providing fetal protection through vaccination. Consequently, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of BVDV vaccination to prevent reproductive disease by performing a quantitative synthesis of previously published studies. Pertinent articles to be included in the analysis were identified by performing a search in four relevant scientific databases (PubMed, CAB abstracts, National Agricultural Library catalog, and Web of Science) and examining the reference lists of 10 germane review articles. Inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis mandated that the studies were controlled, primary studies that included necessary data for use in the meta-analysis (e.g., group size, number of abortions). Forty-six studies in 41 separate articles matched the inclusion criteria. Risk ratio effect sizes were used in random effects, weighted meta-analyses to assess the impact of BVDV vaccination on three outcomes: risk of fetal infection, abortion risk, and pregnancy risk. Within each outcome, subanalyses were performed to evaluate the effect of a variety of interventions, including modified live, inactivated, polyvalent and monovalent vaccination, homologous, heterologous, or field challenge, and studies with only bovine subjects. The analysis revealed a decrease in abortions of nearly 45\% and a nearly 85\% decrease in fetal infection rate in cattle vaccinated for BVDV compared with unvaccinated cohorts. Additionally, pregnancy risk was increased by approximately 5\% in field trials of BVDV vaccinates. This meta-analysis provides quantitative support for the benefit of vaccination in the prevention of BVDV-associated reproductive disease.},

	abstract = {The prevention and control of Campylobacter colonization of poultry flocks are important public health strategies for the control of human campylobacteriosis. A critical review of the literature on interventions to control Campylobacter in poultry on farms was undertaken using a systematic approach. Although the focus of the review was on aspects appropriate to the United Kingdom poultry industry, the research reviewed was gathered from worldwide literature. Multiple electronic databases were employed to search the literature, in any language, from 1980 to September 2008. A primary set of 4,316 references was identified and scanned, using specific agreed-upon criteria, to select relevant references related to biosecurity-based interventions. The final library comprised 173 references. Identification of the sources of Campylobacter in poultry flocks was required to inform the development of targeted interventions to disrupt transmission routes. The approach used generally involved risk factor-based surveys related to culture-positive or -negative flocks, usually combined with a structured questionnaire. In addition, some studies, either in combination or independently, undertook intervention trials. Many of these studies were compromised by poor design, sampling, and statistical analysis. The evidence for each potential source and route of transmission on the poultry farm was reviewed critically, and the options for intervention were considered. The review concluded that, in most instances, biosecurity on conventional broiler farms can be enhanced and this should contribute to the reduction of flock colonization. However, complementary, non-biosecurity-based approaches will also be required in the future to maximize the reduction of Campylobacter-positive flocks at the farm level.},

	url = {http://research-archive.liv.ac.uk/7753/},
	abstract = {Human-directed dog aggression is a worldwide issue with major public health and animal welfare implications. Consequences for the target of aggression range from fear and minor injury, to life threatening injury and death, and for the dog impaired freedoms, restricted interactions and ultimately euthanasia. The systematic review undertaken here aimed to identify and assimilate all robust evidence regarding factors that affect the risk of human-directed dog aggression. Such information is vital for the development of sound preventive strategies. Multiple electronic literature databases were interrogated in order to identify all evidence for risk factors of human-directed dog aggression. The search strategy was designed to minimise the risk of publication and language biases, specificity was sacrificed for sensitivity. The threshold for acceptance of evidence was predetermined at a moderate level; any study that provided evidence with a low risk of confounding and bias and a moderate probability that any relationship identified was causal would reach the final review. Appraisal examined methodological quality, study design, selection process, measurement of outcome and exposures, and type and quality of analysis. All stages of appraisal were undertaken blind to the study findings. On assimilating the evidence identified, no robust evidence for any risk factors of human-directed dog aggression was identified. Eight studies provided a moderate level of somewhat conflicting evidence. Amongst those studies appraised as failing to reach the moderate level of acceptable evidence, the majority were excluded as a result of multiple limitations. It is vital that future research is undertaken to a high methodological standard in order that it provides robust evidence for the effect of any risk factor identified.},

Few studies are repeated and the potential for publication bias is high. There is little evidence that pain management is associated with increased production. This is a concern because survey data suggest producers are partly motivated based on economic factors. The unanswered question is whether economic incentive programs would be greater motivators than increased production.},

	abstract = {Prevalence estimates are used by decision makers such as policy makers and risk assessors to make choices related to certain diseases and infections. Paratuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), is a chronic infection particularly resulting in economic losses among farmed ruminants. Therefore, this infection is of concern for many farming industry decision makers. As a result, multiple studies have been carried out to determine the within-herd and between-herd prevalence of MAP infections. The objective of the present study was to conduct a review and, if possible, compare animal and herd level prevalences of MAP among farmed animals in Europe. European data on prevalences of MAP in all farmed animal species were included from a review of literature. Information on target population and study design, tests used and apparent prevalences were recorded, and subsequently true prevalences were calculated when possible. A critical review of the included studies indicated that although a wide range of studies have been conducted, likely and comparable true prevalence estimates could rarely be calculated. Based on a few studies where the prevalences appeared to be plausible, it was concluded that prevalences of MAP would have to be guesstimates based on available data. The true prevalence among cattle appeared to be approximately 20\% and was at least 3-5\% in several countries. Between-herd prevalence guesstimates appeared to be {\textgreater}50\%. No countries had published sufficient information to claim freedom from MAP or just a near-zero prevalence of MAP infections. No within-flock prevalence estimates were available for goats and sheep. The between-flock prevalence guesstimates were {\textgreater}20\%, based only on estimates from Switzerland and Spain. Major critical issues were identified in the majority of the studies, primarily due to lack of knowledge of the test accuracy of the diagnostic test used, or due to studies where the study population did not reflect the target population. Because most of the reported studies did not yield prevalence estimates which were comparable to other studies, there is a continuing need for well-designed studies of the prevalence of MAP infections.},

	abstract = {Infections with Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) can be latent for years without affecting the animal, but the animal may become infectious or clinical at some point. Diagnosis of paratuberculosis can be a challenge primarily in latent stages of the infection, and different diagnosis interpretations are usually required by the variety of decision makers. The objective of this paper was to provide a critical review of reported accuracies of ELISA tests, interferon-gamma assays (IFN-gamma) and faecal culture (FC) techniques used for diagnosis of three defined target conditions: MAP infected, MAP infectious and MAP affected animals. For each animal species, target condition and diagnostic test-type, sensitivities (Se) and specificities (Sp) were summarised based on a systematic, critical review of information in literature databases. The diagnostic test information often varied substantially for tests of the same type and make, particularly ELISA, which was the most frequently reported test-type. Comparison of the various tests accuracies was generally not possible, but stratification of test-evaluations by target condition improved the interpretation of the test accuracies. Infectious and affected animals can often be detected, but Se for infected animals is generally low. A main conclusion of the review was that the quality of design, implementation and reporting of evaluations of tests for paratuberculosis is generally poor. Particularly, there is a need for better correspondence between the study population and target population, i.e. the subjects chosen for test evaluation should reflect the distribution of animals in the population where the test is intended to be used.},

Coinfection of humans, domestic animals, wildlife, and ticks with both B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum appears to be common, yet the pathologic mechanisms and ecology remain poorly understood compared with single-agent infection. We compiled available literature describing experimental and naturally occurring coinfection with B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum in I. ricinus-complex ticks and host species, including wildlife, humans, livestock, and pets; calculated odds ratios for coinfection risks; evaluated the hypotheses that odds ratios for coinfection differ significantly between different tick life stages, ticks and vertebrate hosts, and reservoir and nonreservoir hosts; and finally, calculated the predicted coinfection prevalence based on the probability of each pathogen alone and compared this to the reported coinfection prevalence. Sixty-one manuscripts referenced coinfection or coexposure between these pathogens, with prevalence estimates for coinfection up to 67\% in vertebrates and 28\% in ticks. Of 61 different reports of coinfection or coexposure, 18 had odds ratios for coinfection significantly higher than 1. The combined odds ratios for coinfection in vertebrates and ticks were 1.9 and 1.28, respectively, with statistically significant variability among host and tick species in odds ratios. The overall predicted coexposure prevalence for vertebrates was 3.1\% compared with an observed 8.9\% prevalence. Odds ratios were not significantly different among classes of vertebrate hosts, species of ticks, stages of ticks, or ticks compared with hosts. We confirm a considerable level of coinfection and coexposure with these pathogens, although not predictably across host or tick species or geographical region.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Q fever is a neglected zoonosis caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii. The knowledge of the epidemiology of Q fever in Kenya is limited with no attention to control and prevention programs. The purpose of this review is to understand the situation of Q fever in human and animal populations in Kenya in the past 60 years, and help identify future research priorities for the country. METHODS: Databases were searched for national and international scientific studies or reports on Q fever. We included studies and reports published between 1950 and 2015 if they reported on Q fever prevalence, incidence, and infection control programs in Kenya. Data were extracted with respect to studies on prevalence of Coxiella infections, study design, study region, the study populations involved, and sorted according to the year of the study. RESULTS: We identified 15 studies and reports which qualified for data extraction. Human seroprevalence studies revealed evidence of C. burnetii infections ranging from 3 to 35.8\% in all regions in which surveys were made and two Q fever outbreak episodes. Coxiella burnetii infections found in cattle 7.4-51.1\%, sheep 6.7-20\%, camels 20-46\%, and goats 20-46\% revealed variation based on ecoregions and the year of study. Farming and lack of protective clothing were associated with increased seropositivity among humans. However, high quality data is lacking on Q fever awareness, underlying cultural-economic factors influencing C. burnetii infection, and how the pathogen cycles may be embedded in livestock production and management systems in the economically and ecologically different Kenyan regions. We found no studies on national disease incidence estimates or disease surveillance and control efforts. CONCLUSION: Coxiella burnetii infections are common in human and in a wide range of animal populations but are still unrecognized and underestimated thus presenting a significant human and animal health threat in Kenya. The factors influencing pathogen transmission, persistence and spread are poorly understood. Integrated disease surveillance and prevention/control programs are needed in Kenya.},

The aim of this systematic review was to identify and evaluate the evidence of efficacy of interventions for treatment or prevention of canine visceral leishmaniasis, and to propose recommendations for or against their use. Forty-seven articles describing clinical trials published between 1980 and 2004 fulfilled selection criteria. The evaluation of clinical trials provided good evidence for recommending the use of meglumine antimoniate at a minimum dosage of 100 mg kg(-1) daily for at least 3-4 weeks, combined with allopurinol in order to obtain a good clinical efficacy and a reduced relapse rate. The evaluation of the articles also provided fair evidence for recommending the use of pentamidine (4 mg kg(-1) twice weekly) and aminosidine (5 mg kg(-1) twice daily) for 3-4 weeks. There was insufficient evidence for recommending the use of allopurinol alone, amphotericin B, buparvaquone, ketoconazole, enrofloxacin, and the combinations of metronidazole with spiramicyn or metronidazole with enrofloxacin. Fair evidence against the use of aminosidine at high dosages (20-80 mg kg(-1) per day) was proposed due to its side effects. Evaluation of articles on repellent measures against sand fly vectors of leishmaniasis provided good evidence for recommending deltamethrin collars and fair evidence for recommending spot-on permethrin.},

	abstract = {The efficacy and safety of pharmacological interventions to treat canine Pseudomonas otitis externa and media were evaluated based on the systematic review of clinical trials published between 1967 and 2006. Clinical trials were included if Pseudomonas species were cultured from the ears of dogs with otitis externa or otitis media prior to treatment, and if the outcome of these interventions was reported at the end of the study. Studies were compared with regard to design characteristics (randomization generation and concealment, masking, intention-to-treat analyses), benefit (microbiological and/or clinical resolution of the Pseudomonas otitis), and adverse effects. Ten trials reporting data on 162 patients and 13 different pharmacological interventions were identified. Based on the accepted criteria for quality of evidence, there is insufficient evidence for or against recommending the use of any of these treatments for Pseudomonas otitis in dogs. This is largely because there is only one trial supporting the use of each treatment option and none were randomized controlled trials. Future studies need to be prospective, randomized, blinded and controlled; designed to evaluate pharmacological interventions for otitis regardless of the infective organism; have appropriate statistical advice on recruitment numbers, the power of the study and appropriate statistical analysis; include details of underlying conditions and concomitant treatments; and be designed such that inclusion criteria include microbial culture and antimicrobial sensitivity, and outcome assessments include clinical examination, cytology and microbial culture.},

	abstract = {Piglets reared in swine production in the USA undergo painful procedures that include castration, tail docking, teeth clipping, and identification with ear notching or tagging. These procedures are usually performed without pain mitigation. The objective of this project was to develop recommendations for pain mitigation in 1- to 28-day-old piglets undergoing these procedures. The National Pork Board funded project to develop recommendations for pain mitigation in piglets. Recommendation development followed a defined multi-step process that included an evidence summary and estimates of the efficacies of interventions. The results of a systematic review of the interventions were reported in a companion paper. This manuscript describes the recommendation development process and the final recommendations. Recommendations were developed for three interventions (CO₂/O₂ general anesthesia, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and lidocaine) for use during castration. The ability to make strong recommendations was limited by low-quality evidence and strong certainty about variation in stakeholder values and preferences. The panel strongly recommended against the use of a CO₂/O₂ general anesthesia mixture, weakly recommended for the use of NSAIDs and weakly recommended against the use of lidocaine for pain mitigation during castration of 1- to 28-day-old piglets.},

	abstract = {This review summarizes evidence for associations between Salmonella prevalence in market-weight swine and changes in feeding management practices or feed characteristics. A systematic review of the topic was conducted with the goal of minimizing the impact of bias on the review conclusions. Potential interventions included feed withdrawal from swine prior to slaughter, feed acidification, heat treatment of feed, pelletized feed versus mash, course versus fine grind, and wet versus dry feeds. In the reviewed literature, Salmonella prevalence was measured either by culture or by the presence of antibodies to Salmonella. The evidentiary value of studies was assessed, and studies that failed to meet predetermined standards were excluded. 7694 potentially relevant references were identified by an extensive literature search; however, 2623 references that were not published in English were excluded, because funds for translation were not available. Of the remaining references, only 277 were considered relevant to the review topic by two independent reviewers, and assessed for methodological quality. During quality assessment, 233 references were excluded because they failed to report design features that limit the introduction of bias or were conducted in a non-target population such as gnotobiotic, neonatal, nursery, or recently weaned pigs and sows. Forty-four publications passed the quality assessment conducted by 2 independent reviewers, but only 15 of the 44 publications reported studies that tested hypotheses associated with feeding management practices and feed characteristics and Salmonella prevalence in market-weight swine. The most common study design was cross-sectional (7/15). The included studies failed to provide strong evidence of an association between any of the potential interventions and Salmonella prevalence, due to the potential for confounding, and the failure to document temporal association between the intervention and Salmonella prevalence. The strongest evidence of an association was found for feed form, i.e. the use of non-pelleted may be potential interventions associated with reduced Salmonella prevalence. The uncertainty is primarily based on studies containing moderate to low evidentiary value or insufficient numbers of tested individuals, resulting in a low degree of confidence that results could be extrapolated to the target population. Therefore, the conclusion of the review is that there should be a low level of comfort among qualified scientists that the claimed association between non-pelleted feed and reduced Salmonella prevalence is scientifically valid. There is no strong evidence regarding associations between presence of Salmonella and the other feed characteristics examined.},

Relevant studies documented Salmonella spp. prevalence at more than one processing point using the same cohort of pigs or the same production line for the post-cooler component. Literature searches retrieved 6811 citations. Sixteen publications, describing 44 studies, evaluated the presence of Salmonella on pork carcasses. The carcass sampling points evaluated were as follows: stun, bleed, kill, scald, dehair, singe, polish, bung removal, evisceration, split, stamp, final wash, immediately after chill, and 18-48 h after chilling. Seventy-eight comparisons of Salmonella spp. prevalence between points along the processing line were reported. The median prevalence of Salmonella spp.-positive carcasses evaluated in the cooler was 0\%. The median prevalence of Salmonella spp. after bleeding was 32\%. Fifty-nine of the 78 point-to-point comparisons were associated with either no change or a decrease in Salmonella prevalence as the carcass moved closer to the cooler. Nineteen point-to-point changes showed an increase in Salmonella prevalence as the carcass moved toward the cooler; of these, six reported a greater than 10\% increase in Salmonella prevalence. The majority of increases were associated with post-evisceration and splitting. These findings suggest that the processing procedures in place generally result in decreased prevalence of Salmonella spp. as the carcasses move toward the cooler.},

A search was conducted to identify all manuscripts relating to antibiotic treatment of cattle with IBK.

Studies which failed to use methods such as blinding, blocking or randomization to minimize bias were excluded from the review. The initial search yielded 196 manuscripts, of which nine described high-quality, randomized clinical trials. These manuscripts reported antibiotic treatment of IBK with florfenicol, ceftiofur, oxytetracycline, procaine penicillin G, procaine penicillin G and dexamethasone, tilmicosin, or benzathine cloxacillin compared to either a placebo control or a non-medicated control. Overall, the studies suggest that antibiotic treatment is successful in reducing healing times of IBK-associated corneal lesions. Very few manuscripts reported a direct comparison of different antibiotic classes, so it was not possible to make comparative evaluations of efficacy. This review demonstrates the need for further randomized controlled trials that evaluate the efficacy of antibiotic treatment for IBK, including direct comparisons of two or more antibiotics.},

DESIGN: Systematic review. SAMPLE POPULATION: 29 manuscripts (41 studies) reporting antimicrobial treatment of BRD in North American feedlot cattle. PROCEDURES: A search of the electronic citation databases AGRICOLA, Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau, and PubMed was conducted to identify relevant manuscripts published between 1970 and 2005. Key study design features were extracted by 2 reviewers. RESULTS: 12 of 29 (41\%) manuscripts did not disclose a funding source, and 21 (72\%) had an author clearly identified as an employee of a pharmaceutical company. At the study level, 36 of 41 (88\%) studies reported a random method of treatment allocation, 9 (22\%) described the method of allocation sequence generation, 20 (49\%) reported that study investigators were blinded to treatment, and 3 (7\%) included a study size justification. No studies described the null hypothesis to be tested. Thirty-seven (90\%) studies reported at least 3 outcomes; the largest number of outcomes reported was 14. It was not possible to conduct the statistical analysis as originally planned because it was not possible to discern the primary outcome for the majority of studies. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Many studies did not report key study design features that would assist critical evaluation by readers. It was not clear whether the studies failed to use the design features or failed to report them. Several nondesign features, such as reporting of the null hypothesis, a primary outcome, and sample size rationale, represent relatively new standards for reporting; however, reporting these features would substantially clarify the study objective.},

The most common animal species were dogs and horses. The most prevalent outcomes were reduced depression, PTSD symptoms, and anxiety.

The public health importance of vaccination against C. burnetii shedding from sheep and goats was evaluated using systematic review and meta-analysis to provide evidence for policy direction to prevent potential zoonotic spread. Publications reporting shedding of C. burnetii in vaginal and uterine secretions, milk, placenta and faeces were included. A single observational (one goat) and seven experimental (four goat and three sheep) vaccine studies were included in the review. No relevant publications on other interventions were identified. Random effects meta-analyses were performed for the risk of shedding in individuals in the control and vaccinated groups and for the mean difference in the level of bacterial shedding in sheep and goats stratified by age and previous exposure status. Limited data were available for further analytic evaluation. From the pooled analysis, an inactivated phase I vaccine significantly reduced the risk of shedding from uterine (RR = 0.10; 95\%CI 0.05-0.20) secretions in previously sensitized goats. Individual studies reported significant risk reduction in milk (RR = 0.03; 95\%CI 0.01-0.26), vaginal secretions (RR = 0.40; 95\%CI 0.22-0.75) and faeces (RR = 0.79; 95\%CI 0.63-0.97) from naive goats. The pooled mean levels of bacteria shed from placental [mean difference (MD = -5.24 Log10 ; 95\%CI -6.75 to -3.7)] and vaginal (MD = -1.78 Log10 ; 95\%CI -2.19 to -1.38) routes were significantly decreased in vaccinated naive goats compared with controls. Shedding through all other routes from vaccinated goats was not significantly different than shedding from control goats. No effect of vaccination was found on the risk of shedding or the mean level of shedding in vaccinated sheep compared with control sheep. Our conclusions are based on a limited amount of data with variable risk of systematic error.},

	abstract = {Presence of Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) in milk for human consumption is a concern due to its possible relationship with Crohn's disease in humans. Pasteurization effectively reduces the MAP load by four to five logs, but the efficacy depends on the MAP concentration, which depends on the prevalence among contributing herds and individuals. Considerable variation of MAP in bulk tank milk (BTM) and individual cow's milk (IM) is reported, but factors associated with MAP occurrence in milk at farm level have not been described. This study systematically reviewed published studies aiming at estimating the occurrence of MAP in on-farm BTM and IM by meta-analysis. A total of 692 articles were identified through electronic databases and initially screened using title and abstract. The quality of the 61 potentially relevant articles was assessed using full text and 31 articles were eventually included in the meta-analysis. The apparent prevalence (AP) of MAP in BTM and IM on farm were summarized in relation to strata defined by the test used to identify MAP and the infection status of the herds/animals. There was considerable inconsistency in the reporting, resulting in missing information potentially explaining the dispersion in the estimated AP. The overall AP and 95\% confidence intervals based on PCR and culture of MAP were summarized to 0.10 (0.04-0.22) in BTM and 0.20 (0.12-0.32) in IM. Quantifying the MAP load in test-positive milk samples was not possible because very few articles provided quantitative information on individual samples.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The management of atopic dermatitis (AD) in dogs relies mainly on the use of interventions to reduce pruritus and skin lesions. OBJECTIVES: To provide a critical analysis of recent clinical trials reporting the efficacy and safety of interventions for canine AD. METHODS: Systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published, presented or completed between 2008 and 2011, which enrolled dogs with AD. The search was done using electronic databases, reviewing published meeting abstracts and sending queries to professional email lists. Trials reporting the efficacy of interventions aimed at treating, preventing or reducing glucocorticoid usage in atopic dogs were selected. RESULTS: Twenty-one RCTs were included. We found further moderate-quality evidence of efficacy and safety of oral glucocorticoids and ciclosporin for treatment of canine AD. There was additional moderate-quality evidence of the efficacy of a topical glucocorticoid spray containing hydrocortisone aceponate. Low-quality evidence was found for the efficacy and safety of injectable recombinant interferons, a budesonide leave-on conditioner, a ciclosporin topical nano-emulsion and oral fexofenadine. There is low-quality evidence of efficacy of oral masitinib, with a need for monitoring for protein-losing nephropathy. Finally, we uncovered low-quality evidence of efficacy of a commercial diet as a glucocorticoid-sparing intervention and of a glucocorticoid spray as a flare-delaying measure. Very low-quality evidence was found for the efficacy of other interventions. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Topical or oral glucocorticoids and oral ciclosporin remain the interventions with highest evidence for efficacy and relative safety for treatment of canine AD.},

	abstract = {Several hydrolysate-based diets have been commercialized for helping diagnose or treat dogs with cutaneous adverse food reactions (CAFR). This systematic review was performed to examine the evidence in favour of reduced immunological and clinical allergenicity of hydrolysates in dogs with CAFR. Citation databases, meeting abstracts and article bibliographies were scanned for relevant citations, and companies were contacted to provide unpublished reports. Eleven studies relevant to this study were identified. Some evidence of reduced serum IgE binding to a soy hydrolysate (1 study) and decreased intradermal test reactivity to hydrolysed proteins (three studies) was found. In four reports, the feeding of dogs suspected of having CAFR with hydrolysate-based diets reduced or eliminated clinical signs in a variable proportion of subjects. The percentage of dogs with CAFR that still reacted to these hydrolysate-based diets could not be assessed, however. Importantly, up to 50\% of dogs with CAFR enrolled in three controlled studies exhibited increases in clinical signs after ingesting partial hydrolysates derived from foods to which they were hypersensitive. In conclusion, the limited number of studies undertaken point to reduced – but not eliminated – immunological and clinical allergenicity of hydrolysate-based commercial diets. A variable proportion of dogs with CAFR will exhibit a worsening of clinical signs when fed partial hydrolysates. Clinicians must weigh the clinical benefit of these diets versus their high cost and low risk of reduced appetence or gastrointestinal sign development. At this time, hydrolysate-containing diets are probably best used in dogs suspected not to be hypersensitive to their individual components.},

Citations identified from three databases (MEDLINE, Thomson's Science Citation Index Expanded and CAB Abstracts) and trials published by December 2007 were selected. Proceedings books from the major veterinary dermatology international congresses were hand searched for relevant citations. The authors selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published from January 1980 to December 2007, which reported the efficacy of topical or systemic interventions for treatment or prevention of canine AD. Studies had to report assessments of either pruritus or skin lesions, or both. Studies were selected and data extracted by two reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by a third arbitrator. Missing data were requested from study authors of recently published trials. Pooling of results and meta-analyses were performed for studies reporting similar interventions and outcome measures. A total of 49 RCTs were selected, which had enrolled 2126 dogs. This review found some evidence of efficacy of topical tacrolimus (3 RCTs), topical triamcinolone (1), oral glucocorticoids (5), oral ciclosporin (6), subcutaneous recombinant gamma-interferon (1) and subcutaneous allergen-specific immunotherapy (3) to decrease pruritus and/or skin lesions of AD in dogs. One high-quality RCT showed that an oral essential fatty acid supplement could reduce prednisolone consumption by approximately half. Additional RCTs of high design quality must be performed to remedy previous flaws and to test interventions for prevention of flares of this disease.},

Studies were compared with regard to design characteristics (randomization generation and concealment, masking, intention-to-treat analyses and quality of enrolment of study subjects), benefit (improvement in skin lesions or pruritus scores) and harm (type, severity and frequency of adverse drug events) of the various interventions. Meta-analysis of pooled results was not possible because of heterogeneity of the drugs evaluated. Forty trials enrolling 1607 dogs were identified. There is good evidence for recommending the use of oral glucocorticoids and cyclosporin for the treatment of canine atopic dermatitis, and fair evidence for using topical triamcinolone spray, topical tacrolimus lotion, oral pentoxifylline or oral misoprostol. Insufficient evidence is available for or against recommending the prescription of oral first- and second-generation type-1 histamine receptor antagonists, tricyclic antidepressants, cyproheptadine, aspirin, Chinese herbal therapy, an homeopathic complex remedy, ascorbic acid, AHR-13268, papaverine, immune-modulating antibiotics or tranilast and topical pramoxine or capsaicin. Finally, there is fair evidence against recommending the use of oral arofylline, leukotriene synthesis inhibitors and cysteinyl leukotriene receptor antagonists.},

RESULTS: The search for, and review and analysis of the best evidence available as of December 14, 2014 suggests that, by 5 weeks in dogs and 6 weeks in cats after starting an elimination diet, more than 80 \% of patients had achieved a remission of clinical signs of CAFR. Increasing the diet trial duration to 8 weeks leads to a complete remission in more than 90 \% of dogs and cats with CAFR. CONCLUSIONS: For diagnosing CAFRs in more than 90 \% of dogs and cats, elimination diet trials should last at least 8 weeks.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anti-allergic drugs (e.g. antihistamines, glucocorticoids and ciclosporin) are often administered to dogs with atopic dermatitis to relieve pruritus and skin lesions. Allergen-specific intradermal tests (IDT) and allergen-specific IgE serological (ASIS) tests are used to characterize the allergens to which dogs are hypersensitive. Anti-allergic drugs have the potential to influence the results or interpretation of these tests. OBJECTIVES: To provide evidence-based recommendations for anti-allergic drug withdrawal times before IDT and ASIS tests. METHODS: Three citation databases and abstracts from international meetings were searched for relevant studies. Studies were grouped based on similar interventions and types of tests. Withdrawal times for each type of drug and test were then extrapolated from the study results. RESULTS: Before the assessment of immediate reactions to IDT, proposed optimal withdrawal times for antihistamines, oral glucocorticoids, topical/otic glucocorticoids and ciclosporin are 7, 14, 14 and 0 days, respectively. Studies have provided no evidence for drug withdrawal prior to ASIS tests for oral ciclosporin or prednisone/prednisolone. Owing to a lack of studies, recommendations for withdrawal times before ASIS tests cannot be made for topical glucocorticoids and antihistamines. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: These proposed withdrawal times are based on the existing evidence at the end of 2011. Care must be taken before extrapolating the suggested withdrawal times to other species, higher dosages, different formulations and/or durations of administration of tested drugs, as well as to other medications from the same category.},

	abstract = {Cattle are kept as an important source of livelihood in many Kenyan farming households whilst also having cultural and social value. A review was undertaken to estimate productivity in the three main Kenyan cattle production systems: small-scale dairy and meat; small-scale dairy; and large-scale dairy and meat. Data on production parameters were collected through a systematic literature search of electronic databases for peer reviewed and grey literature. The parameters included were reproductive rates, mortality rates and yields. Prices for livestock and livestock products were estimated from markets. The data were used to estimate net output from cattle using the Livestock Productivity Efficiency Calculator (LPEC), a deterministic steady state model which measures productivity as net output per megajoule (MJ) of metabolisable energy (ME). The estimated net outputs per livestock unit year(-1) were USD 146.6, USD 215.1 and USD 84.8 in the large-scale dairy and meat, small-scale dairy and meat and small-scale dairy systems, respectively. Milk production contributed significantly to net output in all systems and was 91.8 \% of total output in small-scale dairy. Cattle sales had the highest contribution to net output in large-scale dairy and meat system (45.1 \%). Sensitivity analysis indicated that output was most affected by milk yield, age and weight at maturity and parturition rate. The productivity differences between the production systems call for more detailed research on the constraints to the production systems such as diseases, and to describe the benefits that farmers and society would obtain from disease control and improved management.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human echinococcosis is a neglected zoonosis caused by parasites of the genus Echinococcus. The most frequent clinical forms of echinococcosis, cystic echinococcosis (CE) and alveolar echinococcosis (AE), are responsible for a substantial health and economic burden, particularly to low-income societies. Quantitative epidemiology can provide important information to improve the understanding of parasite transmission and hence is an important part of efforts to control this disease. The purpose of this review is to give an insight on factors associated with echinococcosis in animal hosts by summarising significant results reported from epidemiological studies identified through a systematic search. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The systematic search was conducted mainly in electronic databases but a few additional records were obtained from other sources. Retrieved entries were examined in order to identify available peer-reviewed epidemiological studies that found significant risk factors for infection using associative statistical methods. One hundred studies met the eligibility criteria and were suitable for data extraction. Epidemiological factors associated with increased risk of E. granulosus infection in dogs included feeding with raw viscera, possibility of scavenging dead animals, lack of anthelmintic treatment and owners' poor health education and indicators of poverty. Key factors associated with E. granulosus infection in intermediate hosts were related to the hosts' age and the intensity of environmental contamination with parasite eggs. E. multilocularis transmission dynamics in animal hosts depended on the interaction of several ecological factors, such as hosts' population densities, host-prey interactions, landscape characteristics, climate conditions and human-related activities. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Results derived from epidemiological studies provide a better understanding of the behavioural, biological and ecological factors involved in the transmission of this parasite and hence can aid in the design of more effective control strategies.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Zinc (Zn) is well known as an essential trace element in animal nutrition to ensure optimal body functions and animal health. Previous studies have demonstrated that Zn supplementation has improved the rate of animal growth in practical feeding regimes. Traditionally, the farm animal diets have been supplemented with Zn in the inorganic forms as either zinc oxide or zinc sulfate. The use of organic Zn sources in the form of chelates and supplements for ruminant diets has increased in recent years. Many studies have been conducted to interrogate the relative bioavailability of organic Zn sources in comparison to inorganic forms in ruminant nutrition. Meta-analysis is the statistical combination of results from two or more independent studies for the purpose of integrating findings or results for the under study subject. Meta-analysis can be helpful in determining whether multiple tests of an intervention yield effects on an outcome construct of interest that are similar in direction and magnitude. In the current meta-analysis the organic and inorganic zinc supplementation effects on performance of fattening lambs have been compared. Materials and Methods: A literature search was initially conducted using PubMed, Medline, Science Direct, and Google Scholar data bases and investigated references in the papers. It was also based on the following key words: zinc, organic zinc, inorganic zinc, zinc sulfate, zinc oxide, zinc methionine, zinc proteinate (s), zinc polysaccharide, growth performance, and fattening lamb. The resulting 14 articles were examined for inclusion or exclusion in this analysis. Then seven studies were included in this meta-analysis; and prepared 14 comparisons for average daily gain, 12 comparisons for average dry matter intake and feed efficiency, 11 comparisons for serum/plasma zinc concentration and super oxide dismutase activity, and 13 for alkaline phosphatase activity. Meta-analyses were carried out using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis package, version 2. The size effects of across studies were calculated with fixed and random effect models. The presence of true heterogeneity among studies was identified with Cochran's Q-tests and quantification of the degree of heterogeneity was done with the I2 index. Possible publication bias was evaluated with funnel plot and statistical tests. Results and Discussion: The results of this meta-analysis showed that the addition of Zn in the diet, has a positive effects on average daily body weight gain (+0.5+or-0.17), increase in serum or plasma zinc content (+1.13+or-0.225) and alkaline phosphatase enzyme (+1.4+or-0.205) and superoxide dismutase activity (0.8+or-0.226). However, Zn supplementation in either form (inorganic or organic) had no significant effects on some variable such as daily feed intake (-0.05+or-0.161) and feed conversion ratio (0.06+or-0.241). This quantitative meta-analysis of data from several experiments indicated that dietary Zn supplementation significantly increased average daily body weight gain, serum or plasma Zn concentration, alkaline phosphatase and superoxide dismutase activity in fattening lambs. Superoxide dismutase is a redox metalloenzyme involving in cell defense mechanisms against oxidative stress as well as animal health. This enzyme can reduce oxidative stress therefore improves immune functions.},

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science until December 2019, and references of retrieved relevant articles. STUDY SELECTION: Prospective cohort studies that reported the risk estimates for all cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality in adults aged 18 or older. DATA SYNTHESIS: Random effects models were used to calculate pooled effect sizes and 95\% confidence intervals for the highest versus lowest categories of protein intake and to incorporate variation between studies. Linear and non-linear dose-response analyses were done to evaluate the dose-response relations between protein intake and mortality. RESULTS: 32 prospective cohort studies were included in the systematic review and 31 in the meta-analysis. During the follow-up period of 3.5 to 32 years, 113 039 deaths (16 429‬ from cardiovascular disease and 22 303‬ from cancer) occurred among 715 128 participants. Intake of total protein was associated with a lower risk of all cause mortality (pooled effect size 0.94, 95\% confidence interval 0.89 to 0.99, I(2)=58.4\%, P{\textless}0.001). Intake of plant protein was significantly associated with a lower risk of all cause mortality (pooled effect size 0.92, 95\% confidence interval 0.87 to 0.97, I(2)=57.5\%, P=0.003) and cardiovascular disease mortality (pooled hazard ratio 0.88, 95\% confidence interval 0.80 to 0.96, I(2)=63.7\%, P=0.001), but not with cancer mortality. Intake of total and animal protein was not significantly associated with risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer mortality. A dose-response analysis showed a significant inverse dose-response association between intake of plant protein and all cause mortality (P=0.05 for non-linearity). An additional 3\% energy from plant proteins a day was associated with a 5\% lower risk of death from all causes. CONCLUSIONS: Higher intake of total protein was associated with a lower risk of all cause mortality, and intake of plant protein was associated with a lower risk of all cause and cardiovascular disease mortality. Replacement of foods high in animal protein with plant protein sources could be associated with longevity.},

	abstract = {Leptospirosis is probably the most widespread zoonotic disease in the world especially in tropical countries. There has been an increase in individual studies, which assessed the frequency of leptospirosis in flood conditions. Some studies showed contact with floods was significantly associated with the occurrence of leptospirosis while other studies reported differently. The objective of this meta-analysis was to synthesize the evidence on the risk factors which are associated with human leptospirosis following flooding. We set up the inclusion criteria and searched for the original studies, addressing leptospirosis in human with related to flood in health-related electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Ovid Medline, google scholar and Scopus sources. We used the terms 'leptospirosis', 'flood', 'risk factor' and terms from the categories were connected with "OR" within each category and by "AND" between categories. The initial search yielded 557 citations. After the title and abstract screening, 49 full-text papers were reviewed and a final of 18 observational studies met the pre-specified inclusion criteria. Overall, the pooled estimates of 14 studies showed that the contact with flooding was a significant factor for the occurrence of leptospirosis (pooled OR: 2.19, 95\%CI: 1.48-3.24, I2:86\%). On stratification, the strength of association was greater in the case-control studies (pooled OR: 4.01, 95\%CI: 1.26-12.72, I2:82\%) than other designs (pooled OR:1.77,95\%CI:1.18-2.65, I2:87\%). Three factors such as 'being male'(pooled OR:2.06, 95\%CI:1.29-2.83), the exposure to livestock animals (pooled OR: 1.95, 95\%CI:1.26-2.64), the lacerated wound (pooled OR:4.35, 95\%CI:3.07-5.64) were the risk factors significantly associated with the incidence of leptospirosis following flooding in the absence of within-study heterogeneity (I2: 0\%). We acknowledge study limitations such as publication bias and type 2 statistical errors. We recommended flood control and other environmental modifications that are expected to reduce the risk of leptospiral infection, and a multi-sectoral effort to this aspect would have long-term benefits.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are now the first choice thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients who do not have a high risk of bleeding. In addition to the anticoagulant effects, potential anti-tumor effects of DOACs have also been studied in animal cancer models. In this study, we summarize the effects of DOACs on cancer growth and metastasis in animal models through a systematic review with a qualitative analysis. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science were systematically searched for original studies that describe animal models of cancer in which one of the experimental groups received DOAC monotherapy, and which reported quantitatively on primary tumor or metastases. RESULTS: Nine studies - reporting a total of 19 animal experiments - met the inclusion criteria. These 19 experiments included spontaneous cancer (n = 2), carcinogenicity (n = 2), xenograft (n = 7) and syngeneic (n = 8) models, encompassing orthotopic (n = 7), subcutaneous (n = 5), intraperitoneal (n = 1) and intravenous (n = 2) injection of cancer cells and included treatments with the DOACs ximelagatran (n = 4), dabigatran etexilate (n = 6) and/or rivaroxaban (n = 11). DOAC treatment decreased tumor growth at implanted and metastatic site in 18.8\% (3/16) and 20.0\% (3/15) of the experiments, respectively. Conversely, DOACs increased tumor growth at implanted and metastatic site in 6.3\% (1/16) and 20.0\% (3/15) of the experiments, respectively. CONCLUSION: DOAC monotherapy resulted in neoplastic changes in a rat carcinogenicity study, showed a lack of effect in mouse xenograft models, while the effect on cancer growth and metastasis in mouse syngeneic models depended on the timing of DOAC treatment and type of cancer model used.},

	abstract = {In vivo optical imaging is a powerful tool for revealing brain structure and function at both the circuit and cellular levels. Here, we provide a systematic review of findings obtained from in vivo imaging studies of mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders, including the monogenic disorders fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome, and Angelman syndrome, which are caused by genetic abnormalities of FMR1, MECP2, and UBE3A, as well as disorders caused by copy number variations (15q11-13 duplication and 22q11.2 deletion) and BTBR mice as an inbred strain model of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Most studies visualize the structural and functional responsiveness of cerebral cortical neurons to sensory stimuli and the developmental and experience-dependent changes in these responses as a model of brain functions affected by these disorders. The optical imaging techniques include two-photon microscopy of fluorescently labeled dendritic spines or neurons loaded with fluorescent calcium indicators and macroscopic imaging of cortical activity using calcium indicators, voltage-sensitive dyes or intrinsic optical signals. Studies have revealed alterations in the density, stability, and turnover of dendritic spines, aberrant cortical sensory responses, impaired inhibitory function, and concomitant failure of circuit maturation as common causes for neurological deficits. Mechanistic hypotheses derived from in vivo imaging also provide new directions for therapeutic interventions. For instance, it was recently demonstrated that early postnatal administration of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) restores impaired cortical inhibitory function and ameliorates the aberrant social behaviors in a mouse model of ASD. We discuss the potential use of SSRIs for treating ASDs in light of these findings.},

The present meta-analysis was designed to investigate the efficacy of OEC transplantation on motor function recovery and neuropathic pain alleviation in SCI animal models. Accordingly, all related studies were identified and included. Two independent researchers assessed the quality of the articles and summarized them by calculating standardized mean differences (SMD). OEC transplantation was shown to significantly improve functional recovery (SMD = 1.36; 95\% confidence interval: 1.05-1.68; p {\textless} 0.001). The efficacy of this method was higher in thoracic injuries (SMD = 1.41; 95\% confidence interval: 1.08-1.74; p {\textless} 0.001) and allogeneic transplants (SMD = 1.53; 95\% confidence interval: 1.15-1.90; p {\textless} 0.001). OEC transplantation had no considerable effects on the improvement of hyperalgesia (SMD = -0.095; 95\% confidence interval: -0.42-0.23; p = 0.57) but when the analyses were limited to studies with follow-up ≥8 weeks, it was associated with increased hyperalgesia (SMD = -0.66; 95\% confidence interval: -1.28-0.04; p = 0.04). OEC transplantation did not affect SCI-induced allodynia (SMD = 0.54; 95\% confidence interval: -0.80-1.87; p = 0.43). Our findings showed that OEC transplantation can significantly improve motor function post-SCI, but it has no effect on allodynia and might lead to relative aggravation of hyperalgesia.},

	abstract = {Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative joint disease and is considered as the most common cause of pain and disability. To the best of our knowledge, it is generally observed that there is a lack of evidence on the effects of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on inflammatory cytokines in OA. The present review aims to appraise the current evidence of efffects of LLLT on inflammatory cytokines in OA of the knee. Medical databases such as Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, PEDro CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane register, and Google reference were searched from its inception to June 2019. Articles that meet the inclusion criteria: subjects (animals-Wistar rats) induced with OA; rats with age group of 50-90 days; weight of 150-300 g; finding the effects of LLLT; reporting inflammatory cytokines; and articles written in English were included. The reviewers assessed the methodological quality of the primary studies. Data of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and MMP-13 were extracted for analysis. The Q (x(2)) test and I(2) statistics analysis were performed to find the heterogeneity evaluation. Standard mean difference (SMD) and its 95\% confidence interval (CI) were used to synthesize the data. Two hundred eleven potential articles were identified and 186 articles were excluded based on the selection criteria. The rest of the 25 articles were read and 8 articles were selected for further study. From the study, it is observed that the laser therapy group had mild to moderate improvement than control group in IL-1β, TNF-α, and MMP-13 (IL-1β; SMD 1.21 [95\% CI - 0.278, 2.704], TNF-α; SMD 5.19 [95\% CI 2.413, 7.961], and MMP-13 SMD - 1.45 [95\% CI - 5.121, 2.211]), while IL-6 [SMD 3.11 (95\% CI 0.662, 5.549] did not show any considerable improvement after laser therapy. The present review provides the evidence of LLLT-dependent reduction of IL-1β, TNF-α, and MMP-13, and its ability to modulate proliferation of inflammatory cells, which makes LLLT a suitable treatment for OA. Though the included studies showed a high heterogeneity in treatment parameter, the beneficial effect of LLLT on changes in inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, seems to be unaffected.},

	abstract = {Clinical mastitis affects 3\% of primiparous dairy cattle (heifers) in the first month after calving. Additionally, the prevalence of intramammary infection (IMI) in the months before first calving is high, resulting in a high prevalence of heifers calving with IMI. Precalving therapy is an accepted recommendation for reducing mastitis in multiparous cows, but prophylactic treatment for heifers is uncommon in North America. Objectives of this study were to (1) quantify changes in postcalving udder health in heifers following application of a precalving treatment; (2) compare effectiveness among various types of treatments; and (3) compare effectiveness of various types of treatments against specific pathogens. A systematic review was conducted comparing interventions aimed at improving udder health in heifers. Of 62 included studies, 48 clinical trials were used in a meta-analysis. Data were synthesized using a random effects model for meta-analysis, followed by sub-group analyses comparing treatment types, and specific pathogens with statistical testing using meta-regression. Occurrence of mastitis (defined as elevated somatic cell count, clinical mastitis, and IMI) was reduced in treated heifers compared with untreated controls with a pooled risk ratio of treated to untreated heifers of 0.56 (95\% confidence interval: 0.47 to 0.67). Upon stratification by treatment types, teat sealants and combination therapies (vaccines and antimicrobials; antimicrobials and teat sealants; and all 3) were most effective at improving udder health with pooled risk ratios of 0.40 (95\% confidence interval: 0.30 to 0.52) and 0.34 (95\% confidence interval: 0.25 to 0.45), respectively. Antimicrobials and vaccines also reduced occurrence of IMI and subclinical and clinical mastitis when compared with untreated heifers. Although variation was observed in the pathogen-specific effectiveness of treatments at reducing rates of disease, antimicrobials, teat sealants, and combinations of vaccines or teat sealants with antimicrobials were consistently effective, whereas vaccines were only effective for contagious pathogens. Recommendations for use of antibiotics should consider their relative benefit while also considering potential for increasing antimicrobial resistance.},

We found 38 studies, which were evaluated and finally selected 11 to compose the review, as they exclusively discuss the influence of nutrition in dogs with pancreatitis. It was possible to conclude that the correct and early alimentary management positively influences in cases of dogs suffering with pancreatitis, with the use of early enteral nutrition (NEP) and ecoimmunonutrition. However, more studies are needed, especially those with a high degree of recommendation and level of evidence, thus allowing a better treatment for the patient and consequently a better prognosis.},

	abstract = {Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is the most widespread, tick-borne viral disease affecting humans and therefore this paper performed a meta-analysis to highlight seroprevalence features of CCHF in a global context. After a preliminary review of the 396 papers representing areas throughout the world, 206 were selected for detailed meta-analysis. In general the total means of CCHF seroprevalence were, respectively 4.7 and 24.6\% for humans and animals; and 17.1, 18.9, 24.3, 29.3 and 27.1\% for camels, cattle, goats, sheep and livestock. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference in seroprevalence between humans and camels (P = 0.043), cattle (P = 0.010), goats (P = 0.015), sheep (P = 0.005) and livestock (P = 0.017). Regionally, there also was a difference between humans, and goats (P = 0.0001), sheep (P = 0.007) and livestock (P = 0.002). Globally, CCHF seroprevalence in at-risk professionals was 7.5 fold greater than in normal humans, while CCHF seroprevalence was 5 fold greater in animals, camels, cattle, goats, sheep and livestock than normal humans. Animal contact, animal husbandry, farming, tick bite history and secretion exposure were the most frequently reported CCHF seropositivity risk factors. This study serves as an important resource for epidemiological discussions related to CCHF and CCHF seroprevalence features, providing specific information in understanding human and animal mean and trend CCHF seroprevalence for different regions of the world and on an aggregate global scale; seroprevalence in at-risk professionals; and total mean and trend CCHF seropositivity involving risk factors.},

Therefore, this systematic review aimed to determine the prevalence of T. gondii in mollusks and cold-blooded animals worldwide. We searched PubMed, ScienceDirect, ProQuest, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to 1 August 2020 for eligible papers in the English language and identified 26 articles that reported the prevalence of T. gondii in mollusks and cold-blooded animals. These articles were subsequently reviewed and data extracted using a standard form. In total, 26 studies [involving 9 cross-sectional studies including 2988 samples of cold-blooded animals (129 positive cases for T. gondii) and 18 cross-sectional studies entailing 13 447 samples of shellfish (692 positive cases for T. gondii)] were included in this study. Although this study showed that shellfish and cold-blooded animals could be potential sources of T. gondii for humans and other hosts that feed on them, further investigations are recommended to determine the prevalence of T. gondii in shellfish and cold-blooded animals.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is a zoonotic apicomplexan protozoan that can cause reproductive losses in ruminants across the world. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the worldwide prevalence of T. gondii infection in the aborted fetuses and stillbirths of sheep, goat, and cattle. Moreover, it attempted to evaluate the prevalence rate of T. gondii infection in ruminants that had abortions using serological methods. Based on the keywords, a systematic search of six databases was conducted to retrieve cross-sectional articles in English-language. Data were synthesized to calculate the overall prevalence of T. gondii infection worldwide using the random-effects model with a 95 \% confidence interval (CI). Moreover, the present study includes sensitivity analysis, publication bias test, and quality assessment of the studies. The final analyses included 37, 19, and 8 studies conducted on sheep (4383 aborted fetuses and stillbirths as well as 1940 abortive sheep), goat (248 aborted fetuses and stillbirths and 533 abortive goats), and cattle (460 aborted fetuses and stillbirths and 165 abortive cattle). The overall prevalence rates of T. gondii infection in aborted fetuses and stillbirths globally were 42 \% (95 \% CI: 17 \%-67 \%), and 31 \% (95 \% CI: 11 \%-51 \%) using molecular methods for sheep and goats, as well as 16 \% (95 \% CI: 11 \%-22 \%) and 27 \% (95 \% CI: 1 \%-54 \%) using serological tests for sheep and goats, respectively. In addition, the overall prevalence rates of T. gondii infection in sheep and goats that had abortions were 56 \% (95 \% CI: 35 \%-76 \%) and 50 \% (95 \% CI: 6 \%-94 \%), respectively. These analyses could not be performed in cattle due to the small number of studies and the small number of animals under study. According to the high prevalence of T. gondii infection in sheep and goats that had an abortion, T. gondii could be a potential factor of causing reproductive failures in ruminants worldwide. So, effective control measures and strategies are needed to reduce the rate of abortion in sheep and goats as well as reduce the economic damage to the livestock industry.},

This work conducted a systematic review, gathering and analysing research articles from PubMed and Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde databases whose results report efficacy and non-target effects of using modified insects for disease prevention, until 2016. More than 1500 publications were screened and 349 were analysed. Only 12/3.4\% articles reported field-based evidence and 41/11.7\% covered modification strategies' post-release efficacy. Variability in the effective results (90/25.7\%) questioned its reproducibility in different settings. We also found publications reporting reversal outcomes 38/10.9\%, (e.g. post-release increase of vector population). Ecological effects were also reported, such as horizontal transfer events (54/15.5\%), and worsening pathogenesis induced by natural wolbachia (10/2.9\%). Present work revealed promising outcomes of modifying strategies. However, it also revealed a need for field-based evidence mainly regarding epidemiologic and long-term impact. It pointed out some eventual irreversible and important effects that must not be ignored when considering open-field releases, and that may constitute constraints to generate the missing field evidence. Present work constitutes a baseline of knowledge, offering also a methodological approach that may facilitate future updates.},

Many review papers on the chemical characterization and quantification of phlorotannins and their functionality have been published to date. However, although studies on the safety and toxicity of these phlorotannins have been conducted, there have been no articles reviewing this topic. In this review, the safety and toxicity of phlorotannins in different organisms are discussed. Online databases (Science Direct, PubMed, MEDLINE, and Web of Science) were searched, yielding 106 results. Following removal of duplicates and application of the exclusion criteria, 34 articles were reviewed. Phlorotannins from brown seaweeds showed low toxicity in cell lines, invertebrates, microalgae, seaweeds, plants, animals (fish, mice, rats, and dogs), and humans. However, the safety and toxicity of phlorotannins in aquaculture fish, livestock, and companion animals are limited. Further studies in these organisms are necessary to carry out a systematic analysis of the safety and toxicity of phlorotannins and to further identify the potential of phlorotannins as functional foods, feeds, and pharmaceuticals.},

However, research examining this practice is not as developed. This paper aims to identify the policies and practices influencing the conduct of Animal-Assisted Activities (AAA) in RACF focusing on the Australian context. METHODS: Peer-reviewed and gray literature were searched using an array of databases including CINAHL; Embase; Medline; Pubmed; Scopus and Web of Science; Google Scholar; PROSPERO, Proquest Dissertations; Theses Global; Animal Studies Repository; Medicine and Health Science Commons; Open Gray and a targeted Google search for relevant Australian Guidelines. Database searches had no time limits. Nine documents published between 1990 and 2018 were identified, appraised and subsequently included in the analysis. RESULTS: Facilities have not developed or implemented core policies; instead, there appears to be a reliance on AAA providers ensuring resident safety. Animal welfare is also identified as an emerging area, warranting further action and policy development. CONCLUSION: The requirement for effective AAA policies for RACF staff continues to be an area of need. Over the last 30 years, the development of policies guiding the provision of animal activities within RACFs has been inconsistent in both content and application, including the implementation of basic hygiene policies. If the international situation is indicative, further work is needed in Australia to develop and enforce infection control, risk management and animal welfare policies in RACF and AAA organizations.

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0217420},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite Taenia solium taeniosis/cysticercosis (TSTC) having been put high on the global agenda of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), which over the last years has received a lot of attention, there has been no control programmes in place in sub-Saharan Africa, a highly endemic region. This could be attributed to lack of awareness of many stakeholders on the burden and impact of T. solium. This information is essential in guiding TSTC policies, practices and research agendas as well as encouraging cross-sectoral collaboration in the control of this important zoonotic parasite using a One Health approach. National elimination of the parasite is the foundation for global eradication. This will require that substantial country-level information is provided to all key stakeholders. We have mapped out TSTC research evidence in Tanzania to inform on disease burden and potential for integrated control measures. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A scoping review of all TSTC studies undertaken in Tanzania and published up to December 2018 was conducted. The articles were searched from PUBMED, AJOL, Google Scholar and Google in general. Fifty-one (51) articles met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Prevalence of taeniosis of 2.3\% - 5.2\% was estimated based on copro-antigen ELISA while human cysticercosis of {\textgreater}16\% was estimated based on serum antigen ELISA (Ag-ELISA) or IgG Western Blot. Neurocysticercosis (NCC) contributed significantly to epilepsy in adults. Farm prevalence of porcine cysticercosis were 6.0\% - 17.4\% (lingual examination) and 1.5\% - 33.3\% (Ag-ELISA). Slaughter-slab prevalence were 0\% - 18.2\% (routine meat inspection). Lacking latrines, watering pigs with river or pond water, and feeding pigs with potato peels were associated with porcine cysticercosis prevalence. Washing hands by dipping method increased the risk of human cysticercosis. In 2012, the number of DALYs/1000 person-years for NCC-associated epilepsy was 0.7 (95\% UI, 0.2-1.6), around 5 million USD (95\% UI, 797,535-16,933,477) were spent due to NCC-associated epilepsy and nearly 3 million USD (95\% UI, 1,095,960-5,366,038) were potentially lost due to porcine cysticercosis. Three rounds of annual treatment of school-age children with praziquantel significantly reduced prevalence of taeniosis and porcine cysticercosis. Health education was efficacious in improving knowledge and attitudes favourable for control of TSTC while a single dose of oxfendazole 30 mg/kg body weight was efficacious in eliminating T. solium cysticerci from pig musculature. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The observed high burden of TSTC and the significant contribution of NCC to epilepsy in Tanzania warrant urgent interventions. Evaluation of best control options should make use of disease transmission dynamics models such as cystiSim, taking into account findings from the field based intervention studies. In addition, locally adapted management guidelines for people suffering from NCC are urgently needed.},

H. parasuis infection can result in high mortality and morbidity with, the significant economic losses for pig producers.

A total of 41 articles published between 2005 and 2019, fulfilled the final inclusion criteria. The overall prevalence of H. parasuis in pigs in China was 27.8 \% with the highest prevalence between 2011 and 2015 (41.0 \%). In terms of pig age, the point estimate of H. parasuis prevalence was higher in suckling piglets (29.2 \%) compared with that for other pig ages. The prevalence in the serum subgroup (29.8 \%) was higher than that in the nasal swab subgroup (12.5 \%). The results of the present meta-analysis showed that H. parasuis infection was common in pig populations in China; therefore, effective control measures are necessary to reduce this threat to pig populations.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to quantify the heritability of periodontitis via a systematic appraisal of the existing evidence derived from animal studies. DESIGN: A search was conducted through the electronic databases MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, Cochrane Library, Open Grey, Google Scholar and ResearchGate, complemented by a hand search, for studies reporting measures of heritability of periodontitis. After full-text reading, 7 studies conducted on animal models met the inclusion criteria. Six studies carried out experimental periodontitis models in mice, while one study assessed bone loss in dry skulls of baboons with known pedigrees. RESULTS: Heritability of 'naturally-occurring bone loss' (3 studies, non-experimental conditions) was estimated at 0.39 (95\% confidence interval: 0.13-0.64) with virtually no heterogeneity (I(2) = 0\%, p = 0.97). Heritability of experimental periodontitis in mice (6 studies) was 0.43 (0.28-0.58) with considerable heterogeneity (I(2) = 96\%, p {\textless} 0.01). There was no evidence of publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Over a third of the phenotypic variance of periodontitis in animal studies is due to genetic factors, somewhat higher than the estimate from human studies. It can be argued that, under the strictly-controlled experimental conditions of laboratory-induced periodontitis, the relative role of heritable factors predisposing to periodontitis and bone loss may be stronger compared with human studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mathematical transmission models are increasingly used to guide public health interventions for infectious diseases, particularly in the context of emerging pathogens; however, the contribution of modeling to the growing issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains unclear. Here, we systematically evaluate publications on population-level transmission models of AMR over a recent period (2006-2016) to gauge the state of research and identify gaps warranting further work. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of relevant databases to identify transmission studies of AMR in viral, bacterial, and parasitic disease systems. We analyzed the temporal, geographic, and subject matter trends, described the predominant medical and behavioral interventions studied, and identified central findings relating to key pathogens. RESULTS: We identified 273 modeling studies; the majority of which ({\textgreater} 70\%) focused on 5 infectious diseases (human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza virus, Plasmodium falciparum (malaria), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)). AMR studies of influenza and nosocomial pathogens were mainly set in industrialized nations, while HIV, TB, and malaria studies were heavily skewed towards developing countries. The majority of articles focused on AMR exclusively in humans (89\%), either in community (58\%) or healthcare (27\%) settings. Model systems were largely compartmental (76\%) and deterministic (66\%). Only 43\% of models were calibrated against epidemiological data, and few were validated against out-of-sample datasets (14\%). The interventions considered were primarily the impact of different drug regimens, hygiene and infection control measures, screening, and diagnostics, while few studies addressed de novo resistance, vaccination strategies, economic, or behavioral changes to reduce antibiotic use in humans and animals. CONCLUSIONS: The AMR modeling literature concentrates on disease systems where resistance has been long-established, while few studies pro-actively address recent rise in resistance in new pathogens or explore upstream strategies to reduce overall antibiotic consumption. Notable gaps include research on emerging resistance in Enterobacteriaceae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae; AMR transmission at the animal-human interface, particularly in agricultural and veterinary settings; transmission between hospitals and the community; the role of environmental factors in AMR transmission; and the potential of vaccines to combat AMR.},

	abstract = {Early environments can profoundly influence an organism in ways that persist over its life. In reptiles, early thermal environments (nest temperatures) can impact offspring phenotype and survival in important ways, yet we still lack an understanding of whether general trends exist and the magnitude of impact. Understanding these patterns is important in predicting how climate change will affect reptile populations and the role of phenotypic plasticity in buffering populations. We compiled data from 175 reptile studies to examine, and quantify, the effect of incubation temperature on phenotype and survival. Using meta-analytic approaches (standardized mean difference between incubation treatments, Hedges' g), we show that across all trait types examined there is, on average, a moderate to large magnitude of effect of incubation temperatures (absolute effect: {\textbar}g{\textbar} = 0.75). Unsurprisingly, this influence was extremely large for incubation duration, as predicted, with warmer temperatures decreasing incubation time overall (g = -8.42). Other trait types, including behaviour, physiology, morphology, performance, and survival experienced reduced, but still mostly moderate to large effects, with particularly strong effects on survival. Moreover, the impact of incubation temperature persisted at least one-year post-hatching, suggesting that these effects have the potential to impact fitness in the long term. The magnitude of effect increased as the change in temperature increased (e.g. 6°C versus 2°C) in almost all cases, and tended to decrease when temperatures of the treatments fluctuated around a mean temperature compared to when they were constant. The effect also depended on the mid-temperature of the comparison, but not in consistent ways, with some traits experiencing the greatest effects at extreme temperatures, while others did not. The highly heterogeneous nature of the effects we observe, along with a large amount of unexplained variability, indicates that the shape of reaction norms between phenotype and temperature, along with ecological and/or experimental factors, are important when considering general patterns. Our analyses provide new insights into the effects of incubation environments on reptile phenotype and survival and allow general, albeit coarse, predictions for taxa experiencing warming nest temperatures under climatic change.},

In this systematic review, we determined whether CIA and non-CIA have comparable efficacy to treat nonsevere bovine clinical mastitis caused by the most commonly reported bacteria that cause mastitis worldwide. We screened CAB Abstracts, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Scopus, and PubMed for original epidemiological studies that assessed pathogen-specific bacteriological cure rates of antimicrobials used to treat nonsevere clinical mastitis in lactating dairy cows. Network models were fit using risk ratios of bacteriological cure as outcome. A total of 30 studies met inclusion criteria. Comparisons of cure rates demonstrated that CIA and non-CIA had comparable efficacy for treatment of nonsevere clinical mastitis in dairy cattle. Additionally, for cows with nonsevere clinical mastitis caused by Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., bacteriological cure rates were comparable for treated versus untreated cows; therefore, there was no evidence to justify treatment of these cases with CIA. Our findings supported that CIA in general are not necessary for treating nonsevere clinical mastitis in dairy cattle, the disease that accounts for the majority of antimicrobial usage in dairy herds worldwide. Furthermore, our findings support initiatives to reduce or eliminate use of CIA in dairy herds.},

	abstract = {Human impact on the environment leads to the release of many pollutants that produce artificial compounds, which can have harmful effects on the body's endocrine system; these are known as endocrine disruptors (EDs). Nonylphenol (NP) is a chemical compound with a nonyl group that is attached to a phenol ring. NP-induced H(2)AX is a sensitive genotoxic biomarker for detecting possible DNA damage; it also causes male infertility and carcinogenesis. We attempt to comprehensively review all the available evidence about the different ways with descriptive mechanisms for explaining the possible DNA damage that is induced by NP. We systematically searched several databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and gray literature, such as Google Scholar by using medical subheading (MeSH) terms and various combinations of selected keywords from January 1970 to August 2017. The initial search identified 62,737 potentially eligible studies; of these studies, 33 were included according to the established inclusion criteria. Thirty-three selected studies, include the topics of animal model (n = 21), cell line (n = 6), human model (n = 4), microorganisms (n = 1), solid DNA (n = 1), infertility (n = 4), apoptosis (n = 6), and carcinogenesis (n = 3). This review highlighted the possible deleterious effects of NP on DNA damage through the ability to produce ROS/RNS. Finally, it is significant to observe caution at this stage with the continued use of environmental pollutants such as NP, which may induce DNA damage and apoptosis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nigella sativa or commonly known as black seed or black cumin is one of the most ubiquitous complementary medicine. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of type 2 is defined by the balance between wound healing and tissue fibrosis, which is dependent to the state of inflammation. This systematic review is conducted to provide an overview regarding the reported effect of Nigella sativa and its bioactive compound on the type 2 EMT. METHODS: A search was done in EBSCOHOST, OVID and SCOPUS database to obtain potentially relevant articles that were published between 1823 and August 2019. This review includes studies that focus on the effect of Nigella sativa and its bioactive compound on the events related to type 2 EMT. RESULTS: A total of 1393 research articles were found to be potentially related to the effect of Nigella sativa and its bioactive compound, thymoquinone on Type 2 EMT. After screening was done, 22 research articles met inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Majority of the studies, reported better wound healing rate or significant prevention of tissue inflammation and organ fibrosis following Nigella sativa or thymoquinone treatments. In terms of wound healing, studies included reported progression of EMT related pathological changes after treatment with Nigella sativa or thymoquinone. Alternatively, in terms of fibrosis and inflammation, studies included reported reversal of pathological changes related to EMT after treatment with Nigella sativa or thymoquinone. CONCLUSION: Through this review, Nigella sativa and thymoquinone have been associated with events in Type 2 EMT. They have been shown to promote wound healing, attenuate tissue inflammation, and prevent organ fibrosis via regulation of the EMT process.},

	abstract = {Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease with significant morbidity and mortality. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is an important but poorly understood complication of snakebite associated with acute kidney injury (AKI). Numerous treatments have been attempted based on limited evidence. We conducted a systematic review of TMA following snakebite using a pre-determined case definition of blood film red cell schistocytes or histologically diagnosed TMA. The search strategy included major electronic databases and grey literature. We present a descriptive synthesis for the outcomes of AKI, dialysis free survival (DFS), other end-organ damage, overall survival, and interventions with antivenom and therapeutic plasmapheresis (TPE). This study was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019121436). Seventy-two studies reporting 351 cases were included, predominantly small observational studies. Heterogeneity for study selection, design, reporting and outcomes were observed. The commonest envenoming species were hump-nosed vipers (Hypnale spp.), Russell's viper (Daboia russelii) and Australian brown snakes (Pseudechis spp.). The prevalence of TMA was at least 5.4\% in proven and probable Hypnale bites, and 10-15\% of Australian elapid envenomings, AKI occurred in 94\% (293/312) of TMA cases, excluding case reports. The majority of cases with AKI required dialysis. Included prospective and retrospective cohort studies reporting interventions and renal outcomes showed no evidence for benefit from antivenom or TPE with respect to DFS in dialysis dependant AKI. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) assessment for quality of accumulated evidence for interventions was low. The major complication of TMA following snakebite is AKI. AKI improves in most cases. We found no evidence to support benefit from antivenom in snakebite associated TMA, but antivenom remains the standard of care for snake envenoming. There was no evidence for benefit of TPE in snakebite associated TMA, so TPE cannot be recommended. The quality of accumulated evidence was low, highlighting a need for high quality larger studies.},

Imaging parasites non-invasively in live animals allows efficient parasite distribution evaluation in the host organism and objective evaluation of parasitic diseases' burden and progression in individual animals. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize recent trends in small animal in vivo imaging and compare and discuss imaging of single-cell and multicellular eukaryotic parasites. A literature survey was performed using Web of Science and PubMed databases in research articles published between 1990 and 2018. The inclusion criteria were using any imaging method to visualize a range of protozoan and helminth parasites in laboratory animals in vivo. A total of 92 studies met our inclusion criteria. Protozoans and helminths were imaged in 88\% and 12\% of 92 studies, respectively. The most common parasite genus studied was the protozoan Plasmodium followed by Trypanosoma and Leishmania. The most frequent imaging method was bioluminescence. Among the helminths, Schistosoma and Echinococcus were the most studied organisms. In vivo imaging is applicable in both protozoans and helminths. In helminths, however, the use of in vivo imaging methods is limited to some extent. Imaging parasites in small animal models is a powerful tool in preclinical research aiming to develop novel therapeutic and preventive strategies for parasitic diseases of interest both in human and veterinary medicine.},

Osteoporosis causes bone loss, reduces mineralised density, and inevitably leads to bone fracture. Hormonal deficiencies due to aging or drug induction are also frequently attributed to osteoporosis. Nevertheless, the phytochemical content of natural plants has been proven to significantly reduce osteoporotic conditions. A systematic review was conducted by this study to identify research specifically on the effects of Malaysian herbs such as Piper sarmentosum, Eurycoma longifolia and Labisia pumila on osteoporotic bone changes. This review consisted of a comprehensive search of five databases for the effects of specific herbs on osteoporotic bone change. These databases were Web of Science (WOS), Medline, Scopus, ScienceDirect and PubMed. The articles were selected throughout the years, were limited to the English language and fully documented. Duplication, irrelevant titles, different herbs and in vitro studies were excluded, including those that are not original research papers. A total of 399 potential studies were identified, but only 21 samples were accepted based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Six of the twenty one studies were on Piper sarmentosum, six on Eurycoma longifolia, and the remaining nine studies were on Labisia pumila. Overall, in three of the studies a glucocorticoidinduced model was used, while in 12 of the studies an ovariectomised model was used, and for the other six studies an orchidectomised model was used as the osteoporotic model. All of the studies reported varied results based on the type of herbs used, but in comparison to Eurycoma longifolia, Piper sarmentosum and Labisia pumila recorded better anti-osteoporotic effects, while the majority of studies on Eurycoma longifolia were unable to preserve bone strength.},

	abstract = {Dairy production systems rely on row crop agriculture to produce feed because animal density continues to rise, whereas land allocated to dairy farms is decreasing. Management of the entire dairy system, including animals, forages, and manure, must be optimized to meet production goals while remaining economically viable. Many producers apply dairy manure to meet crop nutrient demand, both reducing the need for synthetic fertilizer and the cost associated with manure disposal. However, repeated manure applications have been linked with environmental concerns, such as soil nutrient loading, increased greenhouse gas emissions, and decreased water quality. The objective of this research was to synthesize the literature comparing dairy manure fertilizer with synthetic fertilizer in row crop agricultural production systems to determine impacts on both crop productivity and environmental quality. Fifty-eight studies were included in a meta-analysis that showed that, when applied at rates providing comparable levels of plant-available N, manure fertilizer matched synthetic fertilizer in crop production, quality, and digestibility. Manure application increased soil organic matter, which may have an overall positive effect on long-term soil fertility, but it also increased soil P, suggesting a threat to water quality. Soil nitrate leaching and nitrous oxide emissions were highly variable across studies, so no clear trends were evident. Overall, these findings suggest that manure is a suitable fertilizer in row crop agriculture, but it should be applied with caution to limit risk to environmental quality, which can vary with site-specific factors like climate, soil texture, and application practices.},

We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis of studies assessing the comparative efficacy of vaccines to control BRD when administered to beef cattle at or near their arrival at the feedlot. We searched MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Daily Epub Ahead of Print, AGRICOLA, Cambridge Agricultural and Biological Index, Science Citation Index, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science and hand-searched the conference proceedings of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners and World Buiatrics Congress. We found 53 studies that reported BRD morbidity within 45 days of feedlot arrival.

The information sources for the review were: MEDLINE®, MEDLINE In-Process and MEDLINE® Daily, AGRICOLA, Epub Ahead of Print, Cambridge Agricultural and Biological Index, Science Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science, the Proceedings of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, World Buiatrics Conference, and the United States Food and Drug Administration Freedom of Information New Animal Drug Applications summaries. The eligible population was weaned beef cattle raised in intensive systems. The interventions of interest were injectable antibiotics used at the time the cattle arrived at the feedlot. The outcome of interest was the diagnosis of BRD within 45 days of arrival at the feedlot. The network meta-analysis included data from 46 studies and 167 study arms identified in the review. The results suggest that macrolides are the most effective antibiotics for the reduction of BRD incidence. Injectable oxytetracycline effectively controlled BRD compared with no antibiotics; however, it was less effective than macrolide treatment. Because oxytetracycline is already commonly used to prevent, control, and treat BRD in groups of feedlot cattle, the use of injectable oxytetracycline for BRD control might have advantages from an antibiotic stewardship perspective.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the exposure-dependent efficacy thresholds of vancomycin have been probed, less is known about acute kidney injury (AKI) thresholds for this drug. Sensitive urinary biomarkers, such as kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1), have shown high sensitivity and specificity for vancomycin-associated AKI. The aims of the study were to determine if there were dose-response curves with urinary KIM-1, and to evaluate the impact of therapy duration and sex on observed relationships. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted via PubMed/MEDLINE. Data were compiled from preclinical studies that reported individual subject data for urinary KIM-1 concentrations, vancomycin dose (mg/kg), duration of treatment, and sex. Sigmoidal Hill-type models were fit to the individual dose-response data. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies were identified, 6 of which reported vancomycin dose and KIM-1 data. Of these, three included individual animal-level data suitable for analysis. For all pooled rats, increasing total daily vancomycin doses displayed a dose-response curve with urinary KIM-1 concentrations (50\% maximal toxic response=130.4 mg/kg/day). Dose-response curves were shifted left for females vs. males (P = 0.05) and for long (i.e. ≥7 days) vs. short (i.e. {\textless}4 days) duration of vancomycin therapy (P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The collective findings demonstrate a clear dose-response relationship between vancomycin dose and AKI. As these analyses focused exclusively on dose-response relationships, additional preclinical data are needed to more clearly define vancomycin exposures that predict the onset of AKI.},

	abstract = {Over the last two decades, the pig population in Africa has grown rapidly, reflecting the increased adoption of pig production as an important economic activity. Of all species, pigs are likely to constitute a greater share of the growth in the livestock subsector. However, constraints such as respiratory infectious diseases cause significant economic losses to the pig industry worldwide. Compared to industrialized countries, the occurrence and impacts of respiratory diseases on pig production in Africa is under-documented. Hence, knowledge on prevalence and incidence of economically important swine respiratory pathogens in pigs in Africa is necessary to guide interventions for prevention and control. The purpose of this review was to document the current status of research on five important respiratory pathogens of swine in Africa to inform future research and interventions. The pathogens included were porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PPRSv), porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyopneumoniae), Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) and swine influenza A viruses (IAV). For this review, published articles were obtained using Harzing's Publish or Perish software tool from GoogleScholar. Articles were also sourced from PubMed, ScienceDirect, FAO and OIE websites. The terms used for the search were Africa, swine or porcine, respiratory pathogens, M. hyopneumoniae, APP, PCV2, PPRSv, IAV, prevention and control. In all, 146 articles found were considered relevant, and upon further screening, only 85 articles were retained for the review. The search was limited to studies published from 2000 to 2019. Of all the studies that documented occurrence of the five respiratory pathogens, most were on IAV (48.4\%, n = 15), followed by PCV2 (25.8\%, n = 8), PPRSv (19.4\%, n = 6), while only one study (3.2\%, n = 1) reported APP and M. hyopneumoniae. This review highlights knowledge and information gaps on epidemiologic aspects as well as economic impacts of the various pathogens reported in swine in Africa, which calls for further studies.},

	abstract = {Cue-induced reinstatement is a widely used model for investigating relapse of reward-seeking behavior with high face validity in relation to clinical observations. Yet, face validity is not sufficient to evaluate an animal model, and quantitative, evidence-based analysis is required to estimate the ultimate applicability of this paradigm. Furthermore, such analysis would allow an accurate and reproducible design of future experiments. Here, we conducted meta-analysis and cluster analysis to characterize the impact of cue type (visual, auditory, olfactory or combinations thereof), intensity (e.g. light frequency, sound volume and odor concentration), reward type (e.g. different drugs of abuse, sucrose and food pellets) and model parameters (e.g. housing condition, age, gender and strain of animals) on reinstatement levels. We selected 184 publications for meta-analysis based on inclusion criteria with a total number of 3889 rats. Our analysis suggested that the exact level of reinstatement depends on neither cue type, nor intensity nor on the type of reward. While all cues induced reinstatement to reward-seeking behavior, it is the model parameters, in particular, the housing conditions, age and strain, that defined the final reinstatement levels. In particular, single-housed, adolescent, Wistar or Lister Hooded rats showed significantly higher reinstatement than adult, Sparague-Dawley rats housed in groups. Our findings suggest that model parameters (for example, single housing) evoke stress-induced behaviors that affect reinstatement more than cue/reward factors.},

For both species, there were significantly more lateralized than non-lateralized animals. We found that 78\% of cats and 68\% of dogs showed either left- or right-sided paw preference. Unlike humans, neither dogs nor cats showed a rightward paw preference on the population level. For cats, but not dogs, we found a significant sex difference, with female animals having greater odds of being right-lateralized compared to male animals.},

This systematic review aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of apheresis in the treatment of these conditions. METHODS: MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE and CINAHL databases were searched to identify studies published between January 1969 and March 2018 involving patients treated using apheresis for severe falciparum malaria, loiasis or babesiosis.

RESULTS: A total of 67 publications met the inclusion criteria and were included in the data synthesis, 36 for malaria (70 cases), 17 for babesiosis (22 cases) and 14 for loiasis (34 cases). Publications were case reports, case series, and cohort studies; there were no randomised controlled trials identified. Potential publication bias was considered to be high. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic review of the literature suggests that apheresis may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of patients hospitalised for babesiosis, and prior to chemotherapy in loiasis with microfilarial count {\textgreater}8000 parasites/mL.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: African animal trypanosomiasis is an economically significant disease that affects the livestock industry in Nigeria. It is caused by several parasites of the genus Trypanosoma. National estimates of the disease prevalence in livestock and tsetse flies are lacking, therefore a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to understand the trend of the disease prevalence over the years. METHODS: Publications were screened in Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, Global Health, EMBASE and PubMed databases. Using four-stage (identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion) process in the PRIMSA checklist, only studies that met the inclusion criteria for AAT and tsetse infections were analysed. Point estimates prevalence and subgroup analyses based on diagnostic techniques in livestock were evaluated at 95\% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 74 eligible studies published between 1960 and 2017 were selected for meta-analysis. This covers the six geopolitical zones, involving a total of 53,924 animals. The overall prevalence of AAT was 16.1\% (95\% CI: 12.3-20.3\%). Based on diagnostic techniques, the prevalence of AAT in cattle was highest in PCR followed by serology and microscopy while the highest prevalence in pigs was observed with serology. Out of 12,552 tsetse flies examined from 14 eligible studies, an overall prevalence of 17.3\% (95\% CI: 4.5-36.0\%) and subgroup prevalence of 49.7\% (95\% CI: 30.7-68.8\%), 11.5\% (95\% CI: 6.1-18.5) and 4.5\% (95\% CI: 1.8-8.8\%) in G. morsitans, G. tachinoides and G. palpalis, respectively, were observed using the random effects-model. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of trypanosomes in both vectors and animal hosts was high in Nigeria. Therefore, further research on risk factors, seasonal and transhumance effects, vectoral capacity and competence are warranted for an effective control of AAT in Nigeria.},

	abstract = {Cryptosporidium is a medical and veterinary significant protozoan parasite that infects all classes of vertebrates. Environmental contamination with infective oocyst increases the risk of transmission to susceptible host. Estimates of Cryptosporidium prevalence in humans and animals are lacking in Nigeria, therefore a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to understand the epidemiology of the disease over a period of 30 years using publications from EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, Web of Science, AJOL and Google Scholar databases. Studies that met the inclusion criteria of Cryptosporidium infections under the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist were analysed. Point estimates prevalence and subgroup analyses based on potential risk factors and diagnostic techniques were evaluated at 95\% confidence interval (CI). A total of 64 eligible studies published between 1987 and 2017 were selected for meta-analysis. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection using quality effects model among human, cattle, sheep, goat, pigs, laboratory animals and birds was estimated as 15.0, 26.1, 16.6, 26.0, 20.1, 9.0 and 7.2\%, respectively. The high report of C. parvum subtype family IIc indicates the importance of anthroponotic transmission of Cryptosporidium in Nigeria. Heterogeneity of subgroup (regions, species) and risk factors (HIV status, age, gender, faecal type) analyses were determined. The pooled prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. in different hosts were high and linked with several risk factors such as environmental contamination and animal contact. There is need for increased awareness on the prevalence of the disease to provide strategies that mitigate the disease in humans and animals.},

	abstract = {The recent increase of parasitic diseases associated with wildlife tourism can be traced to human contact with wildlife and intense modification of wildlife habitat. The continental estimates of parasitic diseases among visited wildlife-tourists and mammalian wildlife present in conservation areas are lacking; therefore, a general review was necessary to provide insights into Africa's parasitic disease burden and transmission between humans and wildlife. A two-step analysis was conducted with searches in Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science and Global Health. All diseases reported without prevalence were grouped and analysed as categorical data while meta-analysis of prevalence rates of parasitic diseases in wildlife from national parks and reserves in Africa was conducted. Only 4.7\% of the tourist centres reported routine wildlife diagnosis for parasitic diseases. Disease intensity shows that cryptosporidiosis and seven other parasitic diseases were observed in both human and wildlife; however, no significant difference in intensity between human and wildlife hosts was observed. Schistosomiasis intensity reports showed a significant increase (P {\textless} 0.05) while entamoebiasis showed a significant decrease (P {\textless} 0.05) in humans as compared to wildlife. Visiting tourists were more infected with malaria, while wildlife was more infected with parasitic gastroenteritis (PGE). The meta-analysis of wildlife revealed the highest prevalence of PGE with mixed parasites and lowest prevalence of Giardia spp. at 99.9 and 5.7\%, respectively. The zoonotic and socioeconomic impact of some of these parasites could pose a severe public threat to tourism. Pre- and post-travel clinical examinations are important for tourists while routine examination, treatment and rational surveillance are important for these animals to improve wildlife tourism.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Lameness in dairy cows has been an ongoing concern of great relevance to animal welfare and productivity in modern dairy production. Many studies have examined associations between various factors related to housing, management, and the individual animal and the occurrence of lameness. The objective of this systematic review was to answer the research question "what are risk factors associated with lameness in dairy cows that are housed in free stall barns or tie stall facilities". Furthermore, we performed a synthesis of current evidence on certain risk factors by means of a meta-analysis to illustrate the strength of their association with bovine lameness. RESULTS: Following pre-defined procedures and inclusion criteria in accordance with the PRISMA statement, two observers independently included 53 articles out of a pool of 1941 articles which had been retrieved by a broad literature research in a first step. 128 factors that have been associated with lameness were identified in those papers. Meta-analyses were conducted for five factors presented in six different studies: Body condition score, presence of claw overgrowth, days in milk, herd size, and parity. Results indicated that a body condition score of ≤2.5/5 is associated with increased odds of lameness. A higher risk of being lame was found for the presence of claw overgrowth, the first 120 days in milk, larger herd sizes, and increasing parity. Throughout the study, we encountered profound difficulties in retrieving data and information of sufficient quality from primary articles as well as in recovering comparable studies. CONCLUSIONS: We learned that an abundance of literature on bovine lameness exists. To adequately address a problem of this importance to both animal welfare and economic viability, solid evidence is required in the future to develop effective intervention strategies. Therefore, a consistent working definition of lameness and specific risk factors should be an option to consider.},

The authors found 64 studies following a systematic search conducted in 3 electronic databases and the World Wide Web using several search queries. Eighteen out of the 64 publications met the predefined eligibility criteria to assess the impact of turmeric on plasma TC, HDL-c and LDL-c concentrations in broiler chickens. Data collected were analysed in OpenMEE software and pooled estimation revealed that turmeric-based diets significantly reduced the concentrations of TC and LDL-c (p{\textless}0.01), and improved the concentrations of HDL-c (p{\textless}0.01) in chicken blood when compared to those on the control diets. Sub-analysis found significant associations between covariates (chicken strain, supplementation level, number of birds per treatment and duration of supplementation) and measured outcomes (TC, HDL-c and LDL-c). Significant heterogeneity (I 2) existed in the meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis found that chicken strain and duration of supplementation were predictors of HDL-c and LDL-c, and explained 72\% of the sources of heterogeneity among the studies used in the meta-analysis. The results of the present meta-analysis showed the potential of turmeric-based diets to modulate the production of blood cholesterol in broiler chickens.},

	abstract = {Nutritional strategies that improve growth performance indices in chickens without increasing feed consumption are desirable considering the escalating feed cost. The use of spices to maintain health and increase productivity in livestock and poultry has been documented. However, a consensus has not been attained whether ginger, one of such spices, improves productivity in poultry. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to ascertain the effect of ginger administration on chicken performance. We searched AGORA, Scopus, Science Direct and Google Scholar for papers published in English using Boolean operators, proximity searching, wildcard and alternate spelling. Selected criteria were randomized and control trials with chickens, studies published in peer-reviewed journals, reported at least one presentation form of ginger and outcomes of interest and a measure of dispersion (standard deviation or p value). Twenty-one papers that satisfy the selection criteria were employed to determine the impact of ginger on feed intake, body weight gain (BWG), feed conversion ratio (FCR), organ weight, semen parameters and total serum lipid (triglyceride and cholesterol) content using Open Meta-analyst for Ecology and Evolution software. A positive relationship was found between ginger and semen quality in chickens. Ginger administration improved BWG (Hedges' d, d = 0.495; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.041-0.949; p = 0.033) and FCR (d = - 0.732; 95\% CI - 1.195 to - 0.270; p = 0.002) taking cognizance of publication bias and heterogeneity. Restricted subgroup analysis showed there is a positive association between ginger powder and FCR (d = - 0.732; 95\% CI = 1.195 to - 0.270; p = 0.002). Meta-regression revealed that covariates (duration of administration, dietary form, inclusion level and strain) explained most of the heterogeneity. The occurrence of variations and publication bias does not pose a major problem in this study since a relatively large number of unpublished studies will be needed to change significant impacts. In conclusion, meta-analytical results suggest enhanced performance in chickens on different levels of ginger administration.},

The authors accessed AGORA, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases for primary studies published between 2011 and 2018 using combinations of different search terms. Fifteen studies were included to assess phytobiotic effect of pepper on DFI, FCR, and ADG in broiler chickens. Random-effects model (REM) was used to generate pooled effect estimates at 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Analysis was performed using Open Meta-analyst for Ecology and Evolution (OpenMEE) software, while publication bias and source of heterogeneity were assessed using standard methods. Dietary pepper supplementation enhanced ADG (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.576, 95\% CI 0.444 to 0.707, p {\textless} 0.001) and FCR (SMD = 0.325, 95\% CI - 0.453 to - 0.196, p {\textless} 0.001) considering the presence of heterogeneity and publication bias. DFI (SMD = 0.052, 95\%CI - 0.069 to 0.173, p = 0.403) was not significantly influenced by dietary pepper supplementation. Restricted subgroup analysis revealed that both black and red pepper increased ADG (p {\textless} 0.001). Broilers on black pepper intervention had better FCR (p = 0.002) than broilers on red pepper treatment. Higher (p {\textless} 0.05) DFI was obtained on broilers fed pepper-based diet at the rate of {\textgreater} 6 g/kg feed for 35 days. There was no association between DFI and explanatory variables (broiler strain used and number of broilers used), whereas study country influenced DFI (p {\textless} 0.001). Furthermore, there was an association between outcome of interests (ADG and FCR) and explanatory variables (supplementation level, study country, number of broilers used per treatment group, and broiler strain used). Broilers on dietary pepper intervention for 42 days had higher ADG (SMD = 62.2 g/bird/day, p {\textless} 0.001) than those on dietary pepper intervention for 56 days (SMD = 35.7 g/bird/day, p = 0.002). There is evidence of heterogeneity, and meta-regression analysis showed that study country, supplementation level, and broiler strain used explained most of the sources of heterogeneity. The results of the present study revealed the potential of dietary pepper intervention to improve production efficiency in broiler chickens. The current meta-analysis also set the steps for standardized experimental designs on the use of dietary pepper intervention in broiler feeding trials in the future.},

However, consensus has not been reached on the use of garlic, one of such phytobiotics to boost productivity of laying hens . The objectives of this meta-analysis were to assess the effectiveness of supplementation with garlic on feed intake (FI), feed conversion ratio (FCR), hen day egg production (HDEP) and egg quality attributes of lay hens. Databases [Scopus, Google scholar, and Access to Global Online Research in Agriculture (AGORA)] were searched for peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English. Criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis were information on moderators (breed, preparation form of garlic, treatment duration, age of hen at the beginning of garlic intervention, country where the study was performed, number of chickens included in the study, inclusion level of garlic), an adequate description of randomization, egg production and egg quality data, and associated measures of variance such as standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE) and P - values. Nineteen (19) out of 53 research papers met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. All analyses were conducted using the Open Meta-analyst for Ecology and Evolution (OpenMEE) software. Overall pooled results revealed that garlic supplementation increased HDEP by 0.322\% [95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.211 to 0.432], egg mass by 0.486 g/day/hen [95\% CI = 0.163 to 0.810], egg weight by 0.069 g [95\% CI = 0.001 to 0.136], egg shell thickness by 0.259 mm [95\% CI = 0.160 to 0.358] and egg shell weight by 0.219 g [95\% CI = 0.087 to 0.350] relative to controls, taking cognizance of publication bias and heterogeneity. Chickens fed diets with or without garlic had comparable FCR. Results suggest that there was no evidence of treatment effect on FI and Haugh unit . Subgroup analysis found that studies that used garlic extract had significant egg weight while studies that used garlic powder and oil had similar egg weight. Meta-regression analysis showed that study country, breed, hen's age, garlic preparation form, inclusion level of garlic, number of hens included in the study and treatment duration were predictors of the study effect. The results of this meta-analysis revealed that layers on dietary garlic supplementation had significantly increased HDEP, egg mass, egg weight, eggshell thickness and eggshell weight compared to controls, although the egg production data for the layers (both treatment and control groups) of specific age, breeds, strain and lines used for the analysis were within their respective target data.},

However, harmonization of available data through systematic review and meta-analysis may foster improved transboundary cooperation for the control of CE in Africa. Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines, research articles (from 2000 to 2019) were retrieved from ScienceDirect, PubMed, African Journals OnLine and Google Scholar databases. A total of 98 studies of 806,624 animals from 13 countries comprising 264,016 goats, 247,326 sheep, 251,106 cattle, 28,314 camels, 4,764 buffaloes, 2,920 equids, 1,966 pigs, 408 wild boars and 50 Norway rats were available for systematic review and meta-analysis of pooled prevalence including 5,048 dogs, 345 lions, 220 hyenas, 94 wolves and 47 jackals/foxes analysed for Echinococcus infection. In total, 46,869 animals were infected and pooled prevalence of CE in intermediate hosts was highest in camels (17.1\%; 95\% CI: 12.1-22.8) and lowest in pigs (0.3\%; 95\% CI: 0.1-0.6). Results also showed uneven species/genotype distribution across the continent such that Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (G1, G3) constituted 74.45\% of the total isolates from East Africa, E. canadensis (G6/7) accounted for 60.3\% and 97.4\% in North and West Africa, respectively, while 81.3\% of E. ortleppi (G5) were recorded for southern Africa. The comparatively higher prevalence estimates for eastern and northern Africa than other regions indicate where efforts on CE management should now be given greater attention in Africa. Additionally, this study also advocates for better cooperation between countries within the same sub-region and the establishment of joint CE control programmes.},

Here, we used a rigorously predefined protocol to search and select eligible publications that utilized either microscopy, serology, or molecular methods to investigate prevalence of trypanosomosis based on the presence of any of three most common Trypanosoma spp. (T. congolense, T. vivax, and T. brucei) in the field-based naturally grazed Gambian cattle, sheep, and goats. To combine results of studies on cattle through meta-analysis, sensitivity and subgroup analyses were carried out with the random effects model, and prevalence estimates of each study with 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were presented with a forest plot. All the eligible studies utilized the buffy coat technique (BCT) to detect trypanosomes in the blood samples, while the more sensitive serological and molecular detection methods are yet to be widely exploited. Heterogeneity among the studies on cattle was moderate (I(2) = 55\%), and the pooled trypanosomosis prevalence based on the BCT was 5.2\% (95\% CI: 4.0-6.4). Meanwhile, estimated prevalence varied according to the trypanosome detection methods, study locations, types of publication, year, and length of observations. We could not pool the trypanosomosis prevalence in sheep and goats through meta-analysis due to small number of studies. The prevalence estimates based on the BCT ranged from 3.2 to 8.1\% in goats and 2.8 to 10.6\% in sheep. Even though there seems to be a slight decrease in trypanosomosis prevalence in cattle in one of the Gambian districts, there was no consistent trend across the years. It is thought that the literature search and formatting procedures presented in this study contribute to doing systematic reviews on the investigated subject and can be adapted for similar cases.},

	abstract = {High ambient temperatures are a challenge for animal production around the world, and they are one of the major reasons for economic and productive losses in pig production. Under stress conditions, the energy contribution to productive functions is reduced, generating health imbalances, decreased productivity rates and changes in animal behavior. Despite the numerous articles published on this subject, the variability of results on performance parameters is high. For this reason, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the actual impact of high ambient temperature (HAT) (29 degrees C to 35 degrees C) on growing-finishing pig performance, compared with animals kept in a thermoneutral environment (TNT) (18 degrees C to 25 degrees C), based on meta-analysis. Data on average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (FI) and feed gain ratio (F:G) were extracted from 22 (n=22) papers published in scientific journals. The values were analyzed using an expansion of the t-test, considering the random effect of each study. Results showed that HAT reduced the values of ADG (654.38 vs 595.81 g/d) and FI (2.141 vs 1.875 g/d) when compared with the thermoneutral group. There was no statistical difference between the F:G values for both groups. In conclusion, high ambient temperatures negatively influence performance parameters of growing-finishing pigs when compared with those in thermoneutral conditions.},

This vector-borne zoonosis occurs in Eastern and Southeastern Asia and an intentional or inadvertent introduction into the United States (US) would have major public health and economic consequences. The objective of this study was to gather, appraise, and synthesize primary research literature to identify and quantify vector and host competence for JEV, using a systematic review (SR) of the literature. After defining the research question, we performed a search in selected electronic databases and journals. The title and abstract of the identified articles were screened for relevance using a set of exclusion and inclusion criteria, and relevant articles were subjected to a risk of bias assessment, followed by data extraction. Data were extracted from 171 peer-reviewed articles. Most studies were observational studies (59.1\%) and reported vector competence (60.2\%). The outcome measures reported pertained to transmission efficiency, host preference, and vector susceptibility to infection within vector competence; and susceptibility to infection within host competence. Regarding vector competence, the proportion of JEV infection reported across all 149 mosquito species in all observational studies ranged from 0 to 100\%. In experimental studies, infection, dissemination, and transmission rates varied between 0 and 100\%. Minimum infection rates (MIR) varied between 0 and 333.3 per 1000 mosquitoes. Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) values ranged from 0 to 53.8 per 1000 mosquitoes. The host species in which mosquitoes mostly fed consisted of pigs and cattle (total of 84 blood meals taken by mosquitoes from each of these host species). As for host competence, the proportion of JEV infection varied between 0 (in rabbits, reptiles, and amphibians) and 88.9\% (cattle). This SR presents comprehensive data on JEV vector and host competence, which can be used to quantify risks associated with the introduction of JEV into the US.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: In the present study, we described the most prevalent clinical symptoms, the most affected organs, and the macro and microscopic lesions associated with cutaneous leishmaniasis. METHODS: Two independent researchers performed an extensive systematic review of the literature in four stages (identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion) to identify studies published between January 2002 and November 2018 from the following electronic databases: Web of Science, PubMed, SciELO, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. Meta-analysis was conducted in "Metaprop" package of R 3.4.2 software. RESULTS: The electronic search yielded 3896 results, out of which 155 were further analyzed based on the full-text. Data extracted from 16 articles were included in the meta-analysis, representing a total of 430 leishmaniasis cases. Only 43\% of all animals were identified to exhibit the clinical and cutaneous changes characteristic of leishmaniasis based on the observation that skin lesions were the most prevalent clinical sign and were present in 86\% of all cases. Other less prevalent symptoms included weight loss, cachexia, apathy and lymph node enlargement. Histopathological analysis showed that the skin was the most affected organ, affecting 64\% of cases, followed by lymph nodes (12\%), spleen (8\%) and liver (7\%). CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, our current findings suggest that cutaneous leishmaniasis could lead to visceral disease. Notably, our findings indicated no clinical manifestation patterns in cutaneous leishmaniasis, since the same host species may present different clinical conditions.},

Methodology A systematic search was performed in the databases Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, SciELO, LILACS, and Scholar Google databases in January 2020, dating from their inception. Pre-clinical studies with natural products for intervention in experimental TMD were included. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, extracted the data, and evaluated the risk of bias. Results 17 records were selected, and 17 different natural products were found, including three lectins, three plants or algae extracts, three sulfated polysaccharides, three cocoa preparations, and five isolated compounds. Concerning the risk of bias, most studies lacked on randomization and blinding. Nociception induced by phlogistic agents was evaluated in most articles, and in five studies it was associated with analysis of inflammatory parameters. In order to investigate the mechanism of action of the natural products used, eight studies evaluated expression of neural or glial molecular markers. Conclusions 16 of 17 natural products found in this review presented positive results, showing their potential for treatment of TMD. However, the lack of methodological clarity can influence these results.},

	issn = {0378-8741},
	doi = {10.1016/j.jep.2020.113464},
	abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Salt-tolerant plants are well adapted to the harsh conditions of the Mediterranean region, where have been used traditionally as food and medicines for human and animals. In addition, various species are currently recognized as sources of metabolites with pharmacological, cosmetical and nutraceutical interest. Nevertheless, ethnoveterinary data on salt-tolerant plants are dispersed in the literature and there are few discussions on its veterinary potential. Having in mind the rising interest on organic farming, alternatives to chemical substances in livestock production and concern for animal health and welfare practices, these plants may represent an untapped resource for animal management and veterinary purposes. In this sense, the purpose of this work is to summarize the ethnoveterinary knowledge on salt-tolerant plants described in the Mediterranean region, raising awareness to the potential of this group of plants to be used in veterinary science, targeting especially ruminants. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Literature search (2000-2020) was conducted using Web of Science and Science Direct databases. Ethnoveterinary reports (EVR) concerning salt-tolerant plants were summarized and filtered for ruminants. From the final 29 publications, EVR concerning therapeutic uses were categorized according to its ATCvet code and results analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 221 EVR were identified from 39 plants, belonging to 21 plant families, targetting ruminants. Ten EVR (4.5\%) concerned uses of salt-tolerant species as animal feed, while around 75\% of therapeutic uses was represented by three categories: alimentary tract and metabolism (QA; n = 75), dermatologicals (QD; n = 53) and genitourinary system and sex hormones (QG; n = 41). Pistacia lentiscus L., Foeniculum vulgare Mill., Dittrichia viscosa (L.) Greuter, Plantago major L. and Hordeum vulgare L. were the most cited species in the latter categories. CONCLUSIONS: The ethnoveterinary knowledge on salt-tolerant species hints some plants of veterinary pharmacological potential, but other species deserve further notice. This information should serve as a basis and, coupled with the currently available scientific data on bioactive properties and chemical composition of salt-tolerant species, inspire additional research on the exploitation of this botanical group, as sources of novel products for ruminant nutrition, health and quality of its products.},

Widespread resistance to synthetic anthelminthics has stimulated the research for alternative strategies of parasite control, including the use of medicinal plants.

This review retrieved 56 scientific articles from 2008 to 2018 describing more than 100 different plant species. The most frequently investigated family was Fabaceae (30.7\%). Most in vitro studies on the activity of plant extracts and fractions were carried out with of free-living stages nematodes. In vivo studies were conducted mainly with the use of plants in animal feed and generally showed lower effectiveness compared to in vitro assays. The main plant secondary metabolites associated with anthelmintic effect are condensed tannins, saponin and flavonoids. However, the studies with compounds isolated from plants and elucidation of their mechanisms of action are scarce.

The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control called for a review of AMR in Nigeria using a \&ldquo;One Health approach\&rdquo;. As anecdotal evidence suggests that food animal health and production rely heavily on antimicrobials, it becomes imperative to understand AMR trends in food animals and the environment. We reviewed previous studies to curate data and evaluate the contributions of food animals and the environment (2000⁻2016) to the AMR burden in Nigeria using a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flowchart focused on three areas: Antimicrobial resistance, residues, and antiseptics studies. Only one of the 48 antimicrobial studies did not report multidrug resistance. At least 18 bacterial spp. were found to be resistant to various locally available antimicrobials. All 16 residue studies reported high levels of drug residues either in the form of prevalence or concentration above the recommended international limit. Fourteen different \&ldquo;resistotypes\&rdquo; were found in some commonly used antiseptics. High levels of residues and AMR were found in food animals destined for the human food chain. High levels of residues and antimicrobials discharged into environments sustain the AMR pool. These had evolved into potential public health challenges that need attention.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Toxoplasma gondii is an important foodborne zoonotic parasite. Meat of infected animals is presumed to constitute a major source of human infection and may be a driver of geographical variation in the prevalence of anti-T. gondii antibodies in humans, which is substantial in the Nordic-Baltic region in northern Europe. However, data on seroprevalence of T. gondii in different animal species used for human consumption are scattered. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of seroprevalence studies and meta-analysis to estimate the seroprevalence of T. gondii in five animal species that are raised or hunted for human consumption in the Nordic-Baltic region: domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), sheep (Ovis aries), cattle (Bos taurus), wild boars (Sus scrofa), and moose (Alces alces). We searched for studies that were conducted between January 1990 and June 2018, and reported in articles, theses, conference abstracts and proceedings, and manuscripts. Subgroup analyses were performed to identify variables influencing the seroprevalence. FINDINGS: From a total of 271 studies identified in the systematic review, 32 were included in the meta-analysis. These comprised of 13 studies on domestic pigs, six on sheep, three on cattle, six on wild boars, and four on moose. The estimated pooled seroprevalence of T. gondii was 6\% in domestic pigs (CI(95\%): 3-10\%), 23\% in sheep (CI(95\%): 12-36\%), 7\% in cattle (CI(95\%): 1-21\%), 33\% in wild boars (CI(95\%): 26-41\%), and 16\% in moose (CI(95\%): 10-23\%). High heterogeneity was observed in the seroprevalence data within each species. In all host species except wild boars, the pooled seroprevalence estimates were significantly higher in animals {\textgreater}1 year of age than in younger animals. Not all studies provided information on animal age, sensitivity and specificity of the serological method employed, and the cut-off values used for defining an animal seropositive. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of animals raised or hunted for human consumption in the region had tested positive for T. gondii. This indicates widespread exposure to T. gondii among animals raised or hunted for human consumption in the region. Large variations were observed in the seroprevalence estimates between the studies in the region; however, studies were too few to identify spatial patterns at country-level.},

Clinical trials were systematically reviewed, using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, LILACS, Web of Science, Scopus, Open Grey, Google Scholar, and ProQuest Dissertation and Thesis without publication year restrictions. References were screened and selected based on predefined eligibility criteria by two independent reviewers, according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Clinical outcomes were assessed quantitatively using clinical pain scores, physical examination, imaging examination, questionnaire responses, pain in manipulation, gait analysis, range of joint motion, and adverse effects. The risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist. Out of 1483 articles, six met the inclusion criteria for qualitative analysis, with two randomized controlled trials and four before-and-after studies. All studies reported significantly better clinical outcomes in the adipose tissue stem cells (ADSC) group with improvements in pain and function and decreased evidence of hip OA. The risk of bias was categorized as high in the before-and-after studies and moderate to high in the randomized studies. The studies were considered heterogeneous owing to clinical results and methodology. Because of this heterogeneity, it was not possible to perform meta-analysis. Assessments of ADSC reports yielded positive clinical effects that showed improvements in pain and function and decreased evidence of hip osteoarthritis. More high-level, larger-cohort dog studies that utilize standardized protocols are needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The changes in bone homeostasis observed during pregnancy and lactation could result in alterations in the rate of orthodontic tooth movement, but research in human subjects presents significant ethical and practical limitations. Our aim was to compare the amount of orthodontic tooth movement between pregnant/lactating or not animals. METHODS: We searched without restrictions 8 databases and performed hand searching until July 2019 (PubMed, Central, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Arab World Research Source, ClinicalTrials.gov , ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global). We searched for studies comparing quantitatively the amount of orthodontic tooth movement between pregnant/lactating or not animals. Following retrieval and selection of studies, the collection of related data was performed and the risk of bias was assessed using the SYRCLE's Risk of Bias Tool. Exploratory synthesis was carried out using the random effects model. RESULTS: Four studies were finally identified raising no specific concerns regarding bias. One study showed that lactation increased the rate of tooth movement by 50 \% [p {\textless} 0.05]. Although an overall increase was noted in the pregnancy group as well, it did not reach statistical significance [3 studies, Weighted Mean Difference: 0.10; 95\% Confidence Interval: - 0.04 - 0.24; p = 0.165]. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic changes occurring during pregnancy and lactation may have an impact on the rate of tooth movement in animals. Although these animal experimental results should be approached cautiously, it could be safe practice to consider the impact of these physiological changes in the clinical setting.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: General knowledge on climate change effects and adaptation strategies has increased significantly in recent years. However, there is still a substantial information gap regarding the influence of climate change on infectious diseases and how these diseases should be identified. From a One Health perspective, zoonotic infections are of particular concern. The climate in Northern regions is changing faster than the global average. This study sought to identify climate-sensitive infectious diseases (CSIs) of relevance for humans and/or animals living in Northern regions. Inclusion criteria for CSIs were constructed using expert assessments. Based on these principles, 37 potential CSIs relevant for Northern regions were identified. A systematic literature search was performed in three databases using an explicit stepwise approach to determine whether the literature supports selection of these 37 potential CSIs. RESULTS: In total, 1275 nominated abstracts were read and categorised using predefined criteria. Results showed that arthropod vector-borne diseases in particular are recognised as having potential to expand their distribution towards Northern latitudes and that tick-borne encephalitis and borreliosis, midge-borne bluetongue and the parasitic infection fasciolosis can be classified as climate-sensitive. Many of the other potential CSIs considered are affected by extreme weather events, but could not be clearly classified as climate-sensitive. An additional literature search comparing awareness of climate influences on potential CSIs between 1997-2006 and 2007-2016 showed an increase in the number of papers mentioning effects of climate change. CONCLUSIONS: The four CSIs identified in this study could be targeted in a systematic surveillance programme in Northern regions. It is evident that climate change can affect the epidemiology and geographical range of many infectious diseases, but there were difficulties in identifying additional CSIs, most likely because other factors may be of equal or greater importance. However, climate-ecological dynamics are constantly under change, and therefore diseases may fall in or out of the climate-sensitive definition over time. There is increasing awareness in the literature of the effects of climate change on infectious diseases over time.},

Most of the outbreaks, investigated in this study, were caused by Escherichia coli and Salmonella, causing 33 and 21 outbreaks, respectively, mostly in Europe and the United States. In the E. coli outbreaks, the total number of reported cases was 1966, of which 1543 were laboratory confirmed. The number of cases requiring hospitalization was 476, of whom 233 cases had a hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), and the reported deaths were 32. All of the E. coli outbreaks, except four, were caused by serovar O157:H7. The other four outbreaks were caused by the following serovars: O111:H8, O26:H11, O111, and O103:H25. Fresh processed meat products were the category most frequently implicated. In the Salmonella outbreaks, the total number of all reported cases was 2279, of whom 1891 were laboratory confirmed. The number of reported cases requiring hospitalization was 94, and seven were reported dead. Regarding Salmonella, eight serovars caused those outbreaks. The most common serovar causing Salmonella-related outbreaks was Salmonella Typhimurium. The food category most frequently implicated in those outbreaks was raw-cured fermented sausages. Other organisms linked to meat-associated outbreaks, but less frequently reported, were Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum, and Listeria monocytogenes. Issues of the burden of outbreaks, the challenges of comparing global outbreaks, food attribution, and how the meat industry works to meet consumer demands while maintaining food safety are discussed.},

	abstract = {Toxocariasis is an emerging zoonotic disease caused by Toxocara canis and T. cati. Toxocariasis and its etiological agents are of global public health importance, whose burden appears underestimated, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The diversity in the transmission routes of these parasites contributes to disease prevalence and often hinders disease control measures. This study aimed to review the epidemiological distribution of Toxocara infections in SSA region. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis). We identified 94 relevant, peer-reviewed articles, out of which, 75 articles were found eligible based on Toxocara infections in dogs, cats and humans. Overall, 27,102 samples were examined for T. canis in dogs, T. cati in cats and Toxocara serology in humans, out of which 6142 were positive for Toxocara infection: 3717 (13.7\%) in dogs (faecal, 3487; necropsy, 180; hair, 50); 266 (1\%) in cats (faecal, 101; necropsy, 165); and 2159 (8\%) in humans (serology). Overall mean prevalences of 19\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 14-23\%), 9\% (95\% CI: 0-28\%) and 36\% (95\% CI: 24-49\%) were recorded in dogs, cats and humans, respectively. Substantial heterogeneity was observed between studies and subgroups (I2 = 99\%, P {\textless} 0.01). Findings from the review showed that studies on the epidemiology of Toxocara infections in the SSA region are limited. We strongly recommend focused, collaborative and coordinated studies to determine Toxocara spp. prevalence in various hosts, including food animals and the environment, through a 'One Health' approach across SSA countries.},

We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the pooled prevalence and heterogeneity of EP using random-effects model. Six electronic databases were searched for publications on EP and assessed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 66 eligible studies published between 1990 and 2019 and representing 24 041 equids were included. The overall pooled prevalence estimates (PPEs) of B. caballi was 22.3\% (95\% CI 21.7-22.8), while the overall PPE for T. equi was 29.4\% (95\% CI 28.7-30.0). The overall pooled prevalence due to co-infection with both parasites was 11.8\% (95\% CI 11.32-12.32). Also, subgroup analysis according to sex, age, diagnostic technique, equid species, region and publication years showed a substantial degree of heterogeneity across studies computed for both B. caballi and T. equi infections in equids. Awareness of the current status of EP globally will alert the relevant authorities and stakeholders where necessary on the need for better preventive and control strategies against the disease.},

Clinical and radiological evaluation showed complete healing during the follow-ups. Statistically significant radiological and clinical evidence of new bone formation was achieved for socket preservation, grafting after third molar extraction, and cystic/apicectomy grafting. One patient with complications was reported. Histological analysis and micro computed tomography confirmed that it promotes bone regeneration.

	abstract = {Background: Maternal care refers to the behavior performed by the dam to nourish and protect her litter during its early development. Frequent and high-quality performance of such maternal behaviors is critical for the neurodevelopment of the pups. Maternal exposure to stress during early development can impair maternal care and amplify the deleterious effects of poor maternal caregiving and neglect. As such, a thorough understanding of the effects caused by several models of early life stress on maternal care may yield more insights into the relationship between stress and maternal behavior. Methods: A systematic review was performed to identify and address the effects of early life stress on maternal behavior. The search was conducted using three online databases: PUBMED, Embase, and Web of Science. To provide clear evidence of the impact of stress on maternal care, in every study, the stress group was always compared to a control group. Outcomes were categorized into eight different behaviors: (1) licking/grooming; (2) arched-back nursing; (3) blanket-nursing/passive nursing; (4) nest building; (5) contact with pups; (6) harmful/adverse caregiving; (7) no contact; (8) nest exits. Additionally, the methodological quality of the studies was evaluated. Results: A total of 12 different early life stress protocols were identified from the 56 studies included in this systematic review. Our data demonstrate that different stress models can promote specific maternal patterns of behavior. Regarding the maternal separation protocol, we observed an overall increase in nursing and licking/grooming behaviors, which are essential for pup development. An increase in the number of nest exits, which represents a fragmentation of maternal care, was observed in the limited bedding protocol, but the total amount of maternal care appears to remain similar between groups. Conclusions: Each stress protocol has unique characteristics that increase the difficulty of rendering comparisons of maternal behavior. The increase in maternal care observed in the maternal separation protocol may be an attempt to overcompensate for the time off-nest. Fragmented maternal care is a key component of the limited bedding protocol. Moreover, the methodological approaches to evaluate maternal behavior, such as time, duration, and behavior type should be more homogeneous across studies.},

	abstract = {Approximately one-third of the fluid milk produced in the United States is lost annually. One important factor contributing to the loss is the contamination with spore-forming bacteria, which can not only survive the pasteurization process but also grow under refrigeration conditions, resulting in subsequent spoilage. The objective of this study was to describe the population dynamics of spore-forming bacteria in milk, from the farm to the packaged product, through a systematic review approach. A database search was conducted to identify, appraise, and summarize primary research studies that described the prevalence and/or concentration of spore-forming bacteria throughout the fluid milk supply chain. Due to variations in sampling points in reported studies, the pasteurized milk supply chain was standardized to include the following steps: "milking machine", "raw milk", "bulk tank", "transportation", "silo", "pasteurized milk" and "packaged milk". A literature search retrieved 9,778 citations, from which 46 relevant citations were selected for data extraction and subsequent meta-analysis. Concentration data were more abundant with 758 data points, as compared to prevalence data with 74 data points. In general, great heterogeneity was observed among studies on the contamination in milk samples with spore-forming bacteria. The findings showed that the concentration of spore-forming bacteria in milk samples increased within the range of 0.58-2.41 logs CFU/mL from raw milk to pasteurized milk according to the weighted mean estimates. Similarly, the prevalence of contaminated samples with spore-forming bacteria increased from 23\% on farm, to up to 58\% at the step of "pasteurized milk". Meta-regression analysis indicates that the variables, season and location, of the study, accounted for 56.35\% of the between-study heterogeneity. Although considerable primary research has been conducted on this topic, there are limited studies that comprehensively describe the dynamic changes of spore-forming bacteria under the current milk production system. In summary, the analyses based on comprehensively collected evidence show that the contamination of spore-forming bacteria originating from the farm remains stable with steady increases as the milk moves downstream. These findings indicate that in addition to on-farm interventions, special attention should be paid to introducing effective mitigation measures at the processing stage to further lower spore-forming bacteria levels introduced by the raw milk, and to prevent post-pasteurization contamination from raw ingredients and processing environments.},

	abstract = {Propolis is a resinous mixture that honey bees collect from the tree buds, sap flows, or other botanical sources. The chemical composition of propolis varies and depends on the geographical area, time of collection, seasonality, illumination, altitude, and food availability during propolis exploitation. The goal of this review is to discuss important concepts including mechanisms of action and therapeutic activities of propolis. The PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for the literature published from January the 1st 2000 to October the 1st 2017. Sixteen animals and three clinical studies were included. A quantitative and qualitative review was performed on the clinical trials and the animal studies were comprehensively overviewed. In this study, the clinical trials have been combined and the results were provided as meta-analysis. Propolis is a non-toxic natural product; however some cases of allergy and contact dermatitis to this compound have been described mainly among beekeepers. An important factor in impaired wound healing is biofilm formation; propolis as an anti-microbial agent can reduce biofilm generation and result in accelerated healing processes. Most of the in vivo studies on various wound models suggested the beneficial roles of propolis on experimental wound healing and this has also been approved in the clinical trial studies. However, there is a lack of information concerning, dose, side effects and clinical effectiveness of propolis on wounds. As the effectiveness of propolis between different products is variable, more characterizations should be done and future investigations comparing different propolis based products and characterization of their specific roles on different models of wounds are highly appreciated.},

	abstract = {Past reports have indicated a high prevalence of milk contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), but the pooled prevalence rates of S. aureus and MRSA in pasteurized and boiled cow's milk, raw cow's milk, and raw Caprinae milk (raw sheep's milk and raw goat's milk) and across different periods, continents, economic conditions and purchase locations remain inconsistent. We searched relevant articles published in PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science before July 2016. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement was used to evaluate the quality of 93 included studies. We observed that the pooled prevalence rates of S. aureus contamination in pasteurized and boiled cow's milk, raw cow's milk, and raw Caprinae milk were 15.4\% (95\% CI, 6.1-27.5\%), 33.5\% (95\% CI, 29.5-37.7\%) and 25.8\% (95\% CI, 17.5-35.0\%), respectively. The pooled prevalence rates of MRSA contamination were 4.9\% (95\% CI, 0.0-15.7\%), 2.3\% (95\% CI, 1.3-3.6\%), and 1.1\% (95\% CI, 0.5-1.8\%), respectively. The prevalence of S. aureus contamination in raw cow's milk increased over time. However, the pooled prevalence of raw cow's milk contaminated with S. aureus was lowest in European studies. These findings give an indication of the consequence of better milk regulation in Europe. High S. aureus prevalence rates in raw milk collected from farms and processing companies pose a potential threat to consumers. The implementation of good hygiene practices, appropriate health knowledge, and food safety principles at the farm level, as well as the prudent use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine and heat treatment before drinking, are necessary to reduce the potential risk of S. aureus and MRSA contamination.},

Here we used the 'One Health' approach to determine knowledge gaps on ESBL-E and CPE in West and Central Africa. We searched all articles on ESBL-E and CPE in these African regions published in PubMed, African Journals Online and Google Scholar from 2000 onwards. Among the 1201 articles retrieved, we selected 165 studies (West Africa, 118; Central Africa, 47) with data from 22 of the 26 West and Central Africa countries. Regarding the settings, 136 articles focused only on humans (carriage and/or infection), 6 articles on humans and animals, 13 on animals, 1 on humans and the environment, 8 on the environment and 1 on humans, animals and environments. ESBL-E prevalence ranged from 11-72\% in humans and 7-79\% in aquatic environments (wastewater). In animals, ESBL-E prevalence hugely varied: 0\% in cattle, 11-36\% in chickens, 20\% in rats, 21-71\% in pigs and 32-75\% in dogs. The bla(CTX-M-15) gene was the predominant ESBL-encoding gene and was associated with plasmids of incompatibility groups F, H, K, Y, N, I1 and R. CPE were studied only in humans. Class B metallo-β-lactamases (NDM) and class D oxacillinases (OXA-48 and OXA-181) were the most common carbapenemases. Our results show major knowledge gaps, particularly on ESBL and CPE in animals and the environment, that might limit antimicrobial resistance management in these regions. The results also emphasise the urgent need to improve active surveillance programmes in each country and to support antimicrobial stewardship.},

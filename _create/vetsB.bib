	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To critically evaluate and summarize available information on the safety of potassium bromide in dogs. DESIGN: Systematic review. SAMPLE: 111 references reporting safety information relevant to potassium bromide published between 1938 and 2011. PROCEDURES: PubMed searches without date limitations were conducted with the terms "potassium bromide" and "sodium bromide" in December 2009 and October 2011. Additional articles were identified through examination of article reference lists and book chapters on seizures in dogs and pharmacology. RESULTS: Reversible neurologic signs were the most consistently reported toxicoses and were generally associated with adjunctive potassium bromide treatment or high serum bromide concentrations. Dermatologic and respiratory abnormalities were rare in dogs. Insufficient information was available to assess the effects of potassium bromide on behavior or to determine the incidence of vomiting, weight gain, polyphagia, pancreatitis, polyuria, polydipsia, or reproductive abnormalities associated with potassium bromide administration. Evidence suggested that administration of potassium bromide with food may alleviate gastrointestinal irritation and that monitoring for polyphagia, thyroid hormone abnormalities, and high serum bromide concentrations may be beneficial. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggested that potassium bromide is not an appropriate choice for treatment of every dog with seizures and that practitioners should tailor therapeutic regimens and clinical monitoring to each dog. Abrupt dietary changes or fluid therapy may compromise seizure control or increase the likelihood of adverse events. Availability of an appropriately labeled, approved potassium bromide product could provide better assurance for veterinarians and their clients of the quality, safety, and effectiveness of the product for veterinary use.},

	abstract = {Conservation efforts to better understand how wildlife populations respond to environmental change and anthropogenic disturbance has led to a proliferation of research examining physiological indicators of stress response in wildlife. Glucocorticoid stress hormones (GCs), typically cortisol and corticosterone, are among the most frequently measured indicators of the vertebrate stress response. To review the current state of research on stress physiology of free-ranging animals and its application to conservation, we canvassed more than 1000 articles on GC measures in wildlife published since 1969. For 454 studies published since 1990, we assessed the most commonly analysed correlates and disturbances and conducted a meta-analysis on commonly studied species. We noted a prominent divide in the legacies of fish-related analyses and those of higher order vertebrates and the need and opportunity to transfer knowledge between fields. Fish studies most frequently measured physiological indicators, condition, and the relationship between stress and mortality, whereas other vertebrate studies most frequently measured reproduction, condition, and environmental correlates. Correlates that significantly influenced GC levels across all vertebrate groups and are thus important to control for in study design and analyses include density and dispersal of conspecifics, season, reproductive status, and social status. Consistent trends across commonly studied species included positive GC response to capture and handling, reduced GC response related to acclimation, and a lack of correlation between condition and baseline GC levels. Our synthesis within and across diverse taxonomic orders reveals substantial research coverage but a lack of depth in multivariate analyses and a disparity in how correlates are controlled. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of correlates and disturbances that influence GC measures and, as such, has useful applications to assist conservation physiologists in study design, analysis, and interpretation.},

	abstract = {The input of agrochemicals has contributed to alteration of community composition in managed and associated natural systems, including amphibian biodiversity. Pesticides and fertilizers negatively affect many amphibian species and can cause mortality and sublethal effects, such as reduced growth and increased susceptibility to disease. However, the effect of pesticides and fertilizers varies among amphibian species. We used meta-analytic techniques to quantify the lethal and sublethal effects of pesticides and fertilizers on amphibians in an effort to review the published work to date and produce generalized conclusions. We found that pesticides and fertilizers had a negative effect on survival of -0.9027 and growth of -0.0737 across all reported amphibian species. We also observed differences between chemical classes in their impact on amphibians: inorganic fertilizers, organophosphates, chloropyridinyl, phosphonoglycines, carbamates, and triazines negatively affected amphibian survival, while organophosphates and phosphonoglycines negatively affected amphibian growth. Our results suggest that pesticides and fertilizers are an important stressor for amphibians in agriculturally dominated systems. Furthermore, certain chemical classes are more likely to harm amphibians. Best management practices in agroecosystems should incorporate amphibian species-specific response to agrochemicals as well as life stage dependent susceptibility to best conserve amphibian biodiversity in these landscapes.},

We review the animal welfare impacts of the wildlife trade as they were reported in the literature between 2006 and 2011. Rarely was the term welfare mentioned, evidence of welfare impact documented, or welfare improvement recommended. Literature focused on mammals and on animals killed on site, for luxury goods or food, and for traditional medicine. Welfare impacts may be underreported, particularly in international, illegal, and wild-caught trade and trade in reptiles. Greater attention should perhaps be paid to the welfare of animals traded alive and in larger numbers (e.g., birds, reptiles, amphibians) and to those-including mammals-potentially subject to greater impacts through live use (e.g., as pets). More evidence-based research is needed. Animal welfare should be integrated with wider issues; collaboration between conservationists and welfarists and the development of health and welfare levers to influence trade offer benefits to both people and wildlife.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify published reports regarding zoonotic pathogen infection among veterinarians. DESIGN: Literature review. PROCEDURES: The PubMed electronic database of medical literature published between 1966 and November 2007 was searched. Clinical case reports and reports of outbreak investigations were also identified through searches of the literature outside of PubMed and searches of references listed in included articles. Reports eligible for inclusion included controlled and uncontrolled studies examining seroprevalence of animal pathogens in veterinarians, serosurveys involving veterinarians, and reports of zoonotic pathogen infections causing clinical illness. RESULTS: 66 relevant articles were identified. This included 44 seroepidemiologic studies (some examined {\textgreater} 1 pathogen), 12 case reports, 3 outbreak investigations, and 7 self-reported surveys (including 4 related to personal protective equipment use). Of the 44 seroepidemiologic studies, 37 (84\%) identified an increased risk of zoonotic pathogen infection among veterinarians, and 7 (16\%) identified no increased risk or a decreased risk. Surveys also documented that veterinarians often failed to use recommended personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our review indicated that veterinarians had an increased risk of infection with a number of zoonotic pathogens. It also suggested that veterinarians may inadvertently serve as biological sentinels for emerging pathogens and could potentially spread zoonotic pathogens to their families, community members, and the animals for which they provide care. Professional and policy measures should be implemented to reduce the risk that veterinarians will become infected with, or transmit, zoonotic pathogens.},

	abstract = {Parasitism of the gastrointestinal tract of cattle leads to diminished health and productivity of grazing livestock. Anthelmintics are used to decrease parasite loads in cattle for improved weight gain. This critical review and meta-analysis aims to quantify the magnitude of the effect of use of anthelmintic products on production metrics in beef stocker calves. Four databases were searched in March 2013. Eligible studies compared average daily gain (ADG), or weight gain in stocker calves in northern climates of the United States that received anthelmintic treatments compared with placebo or an alternative anthelmintic treatment. Study results were extracted, and where possible, summary effect measures were calculated. Of 512 citations identified by the search, 9 manuscripts with 23 relevant individual studies were selected. Risk of bias was assessed for all studies included in the review and assessed to be unclear for the majority of the studies. There were 23 studies that assessed the magnitude of effect of anthelmintic use on ADG (summary mean difference in ADG=0.05kg (50g), 95\% CI=0.03-0.07kg, p{\textless}0.00001). The magnitude of weight gain associated with anthelmintic use could not be assessed, as measures of precision (standard errors or standard deviations) were not reported in these studies. Overall, the conclusion was made that anthelmintic use is associated with an increased weight gain. However, the approach to reporting employed by authors for this type of study means that many studies could not be included in the meta-analysis and the magnitude of effect not determined.},

Study results were extracted, summary effect measures were calculated, and the quality of the evidence was assessed. From 334 citations identified, 10 were relevant to the review. For heifers, there was limited evidence of moderate quality to assess the impact of vaccination on infection risk (RR, 0.89; P = .16; 95\% CI, 0.76-1.05; 6 randomized and 4 nonrandomized studies; 251 animals) and open risk (RR, 0.80; P = .06; 95\% CI, 0.63-1.01; 6 randomized and 5 nonrandomized studies; 570 animals). The quality of the body of work describing the impact of vaccination on abortion risk was low (summary RR, 0.57; P = .0003; 95\% CI, 0.42-0.78; 3 randomized and 2 nonrandomized studies; 176 animals). The quality of evidence was very low for duration of infection (mean difference, -23.42; P = .003; 95\% CI, -38.36 to -7.85; 2 randomized and 3 nonrandomized studies; 163 animals). Although the summary effect measures suggest a benefit to vaccination, due to publication bias the effect reported here is likely an over estimate of efficacy. For bull-associated outcomes, the evidence base was low or very low quality.},

We have conducted a systematic review of prevalence of subclinical mastitis in dairy cows for the period 1995-2014 using electronic and non-electronic databases. Meta-analysis of 28 studies was done under random effects model using Metaprop package in R software. The pooled estimate of prevalence of subclinical mastitis on cow-basis was obtained using 6344 cows from 25 studies and was found to be 46.35 \% (95 \% CI 39.38; 53.46). Meta-analysis for quarter-wise prevalence of subclinical mastitis was carried out using 18,721 udder quarters of dairy cows from 23 studies, and the pooled estimate of prevalence of subclinical mastitis on quarter-basis was found to be 23.25 \% (95 \% CI 18.15; 29.27). Meta-analysis showed that there is statistically high heterogeneity for the prevalence estimates between published studies. The present study reported that there is high prevalence of subclinical mastitis in dairy cows in India, which might be responsible for low productivity in lactating cows in India over the years and needs to be controlled by adopting scientific, managemental, and therapeutic measures. Dairy farmers can reduce incidence and economic losses due to subclinical mastitis under the guidance of field veterinarians.},

	abstract = {European legislation has defined as process hygiene criteria for the main livestock species (cattle, sheep, goats, horses and pigs) the monitoring of aerobic colony count and Enterobacteriaceae. Detected values above the defined criteria require an improvement in slaughter hygiene and the review of process control. The main source of microbiological contamination of beef carcasses along the slaughterline is of fecal origin, therefore Escherichia coli and Enterobacteriaceae seem to be the most suitable indicators to assess the hygienic status of the slaughter process. Although microbiological criteria addressing indicator bacteria have been in place in industrialized countries for several years, scattered information still exists on factors affecting their counts on beef carcasses along the slaughterline. Therefore, a systematic literature review, covering the period 2000-2012, was conducted to gather information concerning: 1) counts of E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae on beef carcasses linked to different stages of the slaughterline; 2) factors influencing presence/counts of E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae on beef carcasses; and 3) the relationship between indicator bacteria (E. coli and Enterobacteriaceae) counts and visual fecal contamination of beef carcasses. According to the 41 retrieved papers the following conclusions were drawn. A decrease of the indicator bacteria counts was recorded after sequential decontamination treatments, such as pasteurization and hot water washing. Slaughterhouse characteristics influenced bacterial load of beef carcasses, although it was difficult to assess which factors (i.e., slaughterhouse throughput, design of the plant, surveillance system in place) had the greatest effect. Finally, carcasses from fecal contaminated animals had higher bacterial loads than those from clean animals. Therefore, the development of a visual classification system of the level of dirtiness of carcasses and the application of effective treatments on the carcasses classified as dirty along the slaughterline can lead to a contamination level for these carcasses comparable to or lower than that of originally clean ones at the end of the slaughterline.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The meta-analysis was performed to identify animal research defining the effects of low power laser irradiation on biomechanical indicators of bone regeneration and the impact of dosage. METHODS: We searched five electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane Database of Randomised Clinical Trials) for studies in the area of laser and bone healing published from 1966 to October 2008. Included studies had to investigate fracture healing in any animal model, using any type of low power laser irradiation, and use at least one quantitative biomechanical measures of bone strength. There were 880 abstracts related to the laser irradiation and bone issues (healing, surgery and assessment). Five studies met our inclusion criteria and were critically appraised by two raters independently using a structured tool designed for rating the quality of animal research studies. After full text review, two articles were deemed ineligible for meta-analysis because of the type of injury method and biomechanical variables used, leaving three studies for meta-analysis. Maximum bone tolerance force before the point of fracture during the biomechanical test, 4 weeks after bone deficiency was our main biomechanical bone properties for the Meta analysis. RESULTS: Studies indicate that low power laser irradiation can enhance biomechanical properties of bone during fracture healing in animal models. Maximum bone tolerance was statistically improved following low level laser irradiation (average random effect size 0.726, 95\% CI 0.08-1.37, p 0.028). While conclusions are limited by the low number of studies, there is concordance across limited evidence that laser improves the strength of bone tissue during the healing process in animal models.},

	abstract = {Meta-analytical approach was used to quantitatively synthesize the effect of immunocastration on growth, carcass, meat quality, reproductive organs and boar taint compounds. Altogether, 41 papers were collected for effect size (theta) calculation and the comparisons were made with entire males (EM) and surgical castrates (SC). The data for reproductive organs and growth performance are numerous enough to draw firm conclusions. In contrast, data for carcass and meat quality are more limited. Results of meta-analysis show efficient immunocastration with the magnitude of the response being by far the largest for reproductive organs (theta = -2.8 to -5.0) and boar taint substances (theta = -2.8 and -0.8 for androstenone and skatole, respectively). However, compared with SC, the immunocastrates exhibit larger bulbourethral glands (theta = 1.3) and slightly higher concentrations of androstenone and skatole (theta = 0.1 and theta = 0.2, respectively). The impact of immunocastration is also remarkable on performance, where the main advantage of the immunocastrates is their boar-like performance until revaccination. In the period following the second vaccination, they eat much more than EM (theta = 2.1), resulting in large effect size for growth rate compared with both EM and SC (theta = 1.1 and theta = 1.4, respectively). Considering the whole fattening period, their feed conversion ratio is higher compared with EM (theta = 0.6) and much lower than that of SC (theta = -1.3), although exhibiting moderately faster growth compared with both (theta = 0.6 and theta = 0.2, respectively). With regard to carcass quality, the immunocastrates take intermediate position between EM and SC. Besides, our analysis suggests no difference in meat quality with SC and some meat quality advantages of immunocastrates over EM because of higher intramuscular fat content (theta = 0.4) and lower shear force (theta = -0.6).},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The emergence of the 2009 influenza pandemic virus with a swine origin stressed the importance of improving influenza surveillance in swine populations. The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to describe epidemiological features of swine influenza (SI) across the world and identify factors impacting swine influenza virus surveillance. METHODS: The systematic review followed the PRISMA guidelines. Articles published after 1990 containing data on SI on pig and herd-level seroprevalence, isolation and detection rates, and risk factors were included. Meta-regression analyses using seroprevalence and virological rates were performed. RESULTS: A total of 217 articles were included. Low avian influenza (AI) seroprevalence (means pig = 4.1\%; herd = 15\%) was found, showing that AIV do not readily establish themselves in swine while SIV seroprevalence was usually high across continents (influenza A means pig = 32.6-87.8\%; herd = 29.3-100\%). Higher pig density and number of pigs per farm were shown by the meta-regression analyses and/or the risk factor articles to be associated with higher SI seroprevalence. Lower seroprevalence levels were observed for countries with low-to-medium GDP. These results suggest that larger industrial farms could be more at risk of SIV circulation. Sampling swine with influenza-like illness (ILI) was positively associated with higher isolation rates; most studies in Europe, Latin and North America were targeting swine with ILI. CONCLUSIONS: To improve understanding of SI epidemiology, standardization of the design and reporting of SI epidemiological studies is desirable. Performance of SI surveillance systems in low-to-medium GDP countries should be evaluated to rule out technical issues linked to lower observed SIV prevalence. Targeting certain swine age groups, farming systems and swine with ILI may improve the surveillance cost-effectiveness. However, focusing on pigs with ILI may bias virus detection against strains less virulent for swine but which may be important as pandemic threats.},

A systematic review was conducted based on Cochrane guidelines. Peer-reviewed analytic journal articles in English were eligible and were assessed for risk of bias by two reviewers independently. Of 11,149 search results, 13 reports in English-language peer-reviewed journals addressed the association between neutering/age at neutering and mammary tumours. Nine were judged to have a high risk of bias. The remaining four were classified as having a moderate risk of bias. One study found an association between neutering and a reduced risk of mammary tumours. Two studies found no evidence of an association. One reported "some protective effect" of neutering on the risk of mammary tumours, but no numbers were presented. Due to the limited evidence available and the risk of bias in the published results, the evidence that neutering reduces the risk of mammary neoplasia, and the evidence that age at neutering has an effect, are judged to be weak and are not a sound basis for firm recommendations.},

	abstract = {The efficacy of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or synthetic analogues in improving the reproductive performance of dairy cows less than 40 days postpartum has not been established. It was postulated that disparity observed between the results of similar trials may have arisen from differences in study design, including the dosage of GnRH used; the number of days after calving at which GnRH was administered; the concurrent use of prostaglandins to induce oestrus; and the enrollment of cows with an abnormal puerperium. The results of 24 trials, extracted from 12 research papers were assessed using meta-analysis. When all trials were considered, treatment with GnRH did not significantly alter the number of days to first oestrus or first service or the relative risk of pregnancy at first service (P {\textgreater} 0.05). While treatment did significantly reduce the number of days open by 2.75 days and the number of services per conception by 0.05 services, the results of these studies were heterogenous (P {\textless} 0.001) and the validity of pooled estimates questionable. The results of the subgroup of studies that enrolled only cows with a normal puerperium were homogenous for all outcomes examined (P {\textgreater} 0.43), although none of the pooled estimates were significant. Sensitivity analyses, performed by excluding the consistently outlying results of one study, improved the homogeneity of all outcomes (P {\textgreater} 0.03) and produced a significant reduction of 4.52 days to first oestrus in treated cows. Pooled estimates derived without the results of the outlying study were considered more valid indicators of the direction and likely magnitude of effect than those derived in the heterogenous overall analyses. The results of this meta-analysis showed that while blanket treatment of dairy cows in the postpartum period may reduce the number of days to first oestrus, subsequent reproductive performance is unaltered. The study also demonstrated a need to concentrate further research on the potential for treatment with GnRH during the postpartum period to improve the reproductive performance of cows with an abnormal puerperium.},

	abstract = {The risk factors associated with canine visceral leishmaniosis (CVL) in Brazil are unclear and controversial. The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to identify the best evidence available in this field and to determine the gaps in existing knowledge. Literature searches were carried out using four databases, the reference lists within articles, and references provided by experts in the field. Theoretical discussions or separate and independent meta-analyses of p-values or of effect sizes were used to pool information about each variable. Thirty-six articles were selected for detailed review, including 31 cross-sectional, two ecological and three cohort studies. The variables showing significant association with CVL were short hair, purebred, peri-domestic restricted (as compared with domestic-restricted dogs), and presence of green areas adjacent to home. The occurrence of CVL was also associated with the presence of domestic fowl in the home environment, with free dogs (as compared with restrained dogs), with male gender and with dogs {\textgreater}1 or 2 years of age, although these associations were not statistically significant. Due to the small number of publications, consistent results could not be obtained concerning the role of other factors. Most studies did not describe the criteria of eligibility and the process of selection of participants in sufficient detail and employed only one diagnostic test as proof of infection. Few studies controlled for confounding variables. No statistical evidence of publication bias was detected, but a great deal of information contained in the primary articles was lost because the results were not adequately described. The results of this review contribute to a better understanding of CVL and should assist in optimizing the development and implementation of control policies. Continuous actions, prioritizing dogs at higher risk and areas with higher abundance of green vegetation, together with policies to promote responsible dog ownership are mandatory. Problems concerning study design and data analysis described in the present study need to be taken into consideration in future studies. These must follow clear procedures to select participants and utilize standardized, valid and reliable diagnostic methods. The development of multivariate models and the use of the STROBE statement for description of the results should also be encouraged. Further research should investigate the patterns identified and prioritize CVL-related factors that have not been fully recognized or elucidated. Finally, ecological and cohort studies of CVL and investigations in other countries of Latin America are urgently required.},

The methods used to estimate the abundance of this group of dogs are more complex than the ones used with domiciled owned dogs. In this systematic review, we analyze the techniques and the results obtained in studies that seek to estimate the size of free-ranging dog populations. Twenty-six studies were reviewed regarding the quality of execution and their capacity to generate valid estimates. Seven of the eight publications that take a simple count of the animal population did not consider the different probabilities of animal detection; only one study used methods based on distances; twelve relied on capture-recapture models for closed populations without considering heterogeneities in capture probabilities; six studies applied their own methods with different potential and limitations. Potential sources of bias in the studies were related to the inadequate description or implementation of animal capturing or viewing procedures and to inadequacies in the identification and registration of dogs. Thus, there was a predominance of estimates with low validity. Abundance and density estimates carried high variability, and all studies identified a greater number of male dogs. We point to enhancements necessary for the implementation of future studies and to potential updates and revisions to the recommendations of the World Health Organization with respect to the estimation of free-ranging dog populations.},

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review. STUDY POPULATION: Peer reviewed literature on canine OA. METHODS: A computer-based bibliographic search was performed on PubMed and CAB Abstracts in August 2013 to find peer reviewed publications relevant to canine OA. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. The outcome measures reported within each publication were recorded and categorized for comparison. Adequately described outcome measures were assessed for uniqueness and evidence of prior validation. RESULTS: Of 3,697 publications identified and screened, 117 were deemed eligible for inclusion. Within eligible publications, outcome measures were used 618 times (median of 4 outcome measures per publication). Outcomes measured were divided into 5 groups containing 65 categories. The most frequently assessed outcomes were lameness assessment with no stated gait/mixed gaits (66 outcomes), radiography (58), and lameness single gait/lateral motion (55). Of 618 outcome measures reported, 491 were assessed for uniqueness and 348 (71\%) were unique to a single publication. Ten outcome measures were reported to have been validated. CONCLUSION: Many outcome measures have been used to assess canine OA. There is no consensus on which are the most useful outcomes or by which method they should be assessed. There is a pressing need for agreement on outcomes reporting in canine OA and for validation of outcome measures used for these assessments. Until consensus is reached, we recommend at least one validated outcome measure be used in every clinical study.},

DESIGN: Literature review and survey of state public health veterinarians and state epidemiologists. PROCEDURE: MEDLINE and agriculture databases were searched from 1966 through 2000. Retrieved references and additional resources provided by the authors were reviewed. A survey was sent to state public health veterinarians and state epidemiologists to determine whether their states had written recommendations or guidelines for controlling zoonotic diseases in animal exhibition venues, whether their states maintained a listing of animal exhibitors in the state, and whether they had any information on recent outbreaks involving animals in exhibitions. RESULTS: 11 published outbreaks were identified. These outbreaks occurred in a variety of settings including petting zoos, farms, and a zoological park. An additional episode involving exposure to a potentially rabid bear required extensive public health resources. A survey of state public health veterinarians identified 16 additional unpublished outbreaks or incidents. Most states did not have written recommendations or guidelines for controlling zoonotic diseases or any means to disseminate educational materials to animal exhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Recent outbreaks of zoonotic diseases associated with contact with animals in exhibition venues highlight concerns for disease transmission to public visitors. Only a handful of states have written guidelines for preventing zoonotic disease transmission in animal exhibition venues, and published recommendations currently available focus on preventing enteric diseases and largely do not address other zoonotic diseases or prevention of bite wounds.},

	abstract = {ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cultures throughout the world give plants to their dogs in order to improve hunting success. These practices are best developed in lowland Ecuador and Peru. There is no experimental evidence for the efficacy of these practices nor critical reviews that consider possible pharmacological effects on dogs based on the chemistry of the ethnoverterinary plants. AIM: This review has three specific aims: (1) determine what plants the Ecuadorian Shuar and Quichua give to dogs to improve their hunting abilities, (2) determine what plants other cultures give to dogs for the same purpose, and (3) assess the possible pharmacological basis for the use of these plants, particularly the psychoactive ones. METHODS: We gathered Shuar (Province of Morona-Santiago) and Quichua (Napo and Orellano Provinces) data from our previous publications and field notes. All specimens were vouchered and deposited in QCNE with duplicates sent to NY and MO. Data presented from other cultures derived from published studies on ethnoveterinary medicine. Species names were updated, when necessary, and family assignments follow APG III (Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, 2009. An update of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification for the orders and families of flowering plants: APG III. Bot. J. Linn. Soc. 161, 105-121). Chemical data were found using PubMed and SciFinder. RESULTS: The Shuar and Quichua of Ecuador use at least 22 species for ethnoveterinary purposes, including all but one of their principal hallucinogens. Literature surveys identified 43 species used in other cultures to improve hunting ability. No published studies have examined the pharmacological active of these plant species in dogs. We, thus, combined phytochemical data with the ethnobotanical reports of each plant and then classified each species into a likely pharmacological category: depuratives/deodorant, olfactory sensitizer, ophthalmic, or psychoactive. CONCLUSIONS: The use of psychoactive substances to improve a dogs hunting ability seems counterintuitive, yet its prevalence suggests that it is both adaptive and that it has an underlying pharmacological explanation. We hypothesize that hallucinogenic plants alter perception in hunting dogs by diminishing extraneous signals and by enhancing sensory perception (most likely olfaction) that is directly involved in the detection and capture of game. If this is true, plant substances also might enhance the ability of dogs to detect explosives, drugs, human remains, or other targets for which they are valued.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate the literature reporting outcome of surgical treatments for canine hip dysplasia (CHD) and to evaluate whether adequate evidence exists to support a procedure that will allow a consistent return to normal function. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review. ANIMALS: Dogs with naturally occurring CHD. METHODS: An a priori question was defined and a computer-based bibliographic search was performed on PubMed, Medline, CAB Abstracts, and Veterinary Information Network through November 2012. Studies were compared and evaluated with regard to surgical technique, study design, outcome measurements, evidence classification, and evidence quality. Unilateral surgeries with {\textgreater}6 months postoperative follow-up were included. RESULTS: Manuscripts (n = 477) were identified and reviewed; 17 met the inclusion criteria. One study provided level I evidence, 2 provided level II evidence, 3 provided level III evidence, and 11 provided level IV evidence relative to the study question. The most common outcome measurements were orthopedic examination (70.6\%), owner interview (70.6\%), and visual gait observation (64.7\%). Three studies used objective kinetic gait assessment. Two studies with level III evidence (total hip replacement) and 1 study with level IV evidence (juvenile pubic symphysiodesis) documented a consistent return to normal function after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a large number of publications describing clinical outcome after surgical treatments for CHD, few provided strong evidence to allow an adequate assessment of therapeutic efficacy.},

The aim of this systematic review was to answer the a priori question, "Is there a surgical procedure that will allow a consistent return to normal clinical function in dogs with cranial cruciate ligament disease and is that procedure superior to others?" A systematic literature search was performed through September 2013. Peer reviewed publication in the English language and 6 mo of postoperative follow-up were required. In total, 444 manuscripts were identified and reviewed, and 34 met the inclusion criteria. Two studies provided level 1, 6 provided level 2, 6 provided level 3, and 20 provided level 4 evidence relative to the study question. The most common surgical procedures included tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO, n = 14), lateral extracapsular suture (n = 13), tibial tuberosity advancement (n = 6). The strength of the evaluated evidence most strongly supports the ability of the TPLO in the ability to return dogs to normal function. It also provided strong support that functional recovery in the intermediate postoperative time period was superior following TPLO compared with lateral extracapsular suture. There was insufficient data to adequately evaluate other surgical procedures.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted to determine the maintenance energy requirements of adult dogs. Suitable publications were first identified, and then used to generate relationships amongst energy requirements, husbandry, activity level, methodology, sex, neuter status, dog size, and age in healthy adult dogs. Allometric equations for maintenance energy requirements were determined using log-log linear regression. So that the resulting equations could readily be compared with equations reported by the National Research Council, maintenance energy requirements in the current study were determined in kcal/kg0.75 body weight (BW). Ultimately, the data of 70 treatment groups from 29 publications were used, and mean (+/- standard deviation) maintenance energy requirements were 142.8+/-55.3 kcal.kgBW-0.75.day-1. The corresponding allometric equation was 81.5 kcal.kgBW-0.93.day-1 (adjusted R2 = 0.64; 70 treatment groups). Type of husbandry had a significant effect on maintenance energy requirements (P{\textless}0.001): requirements were greatest in racing dogs, followed by working dogs and hunting dogs, whilst the energy requirements of pet dogs and kennel dogs were least. Maintenance energy requirements were less in neutered compared with sexually intact dogs (P{\textless}0.001), but there was no effect of sex. Further, reported activity level tended to effect the maintenance energy requirement of the dog (P = 0.09). This review suggests that estimating maintenance energy requirements based on BW alone may not be accurate, but that predictions that factor in husbandry, neuter status and, possibly, activity level might be superior. Additionally, more information on the nutrient requirements of older dogs, and those at the extremes of body size (i.e. giant and toy breeds) is needed.},

Intervention strategies based on the exploitation of the emotional aspects of human-dog relationships hold the potential to overcome the difficulty of subjects with ASD to relate and interact effectively with others, targeting core symptoms of this disorder. METHODS: This review summarizes the results of six published studies on the effects of brief interactions with dogs and the effects of introducing dogs in families with a child diagnosed with ASD, with an emphasis on social behaviors and language use. Furthermore, the possible mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects observed are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Although the studies described here are encouraging, further research with better designs and using larger samples is needed to strengthen translation of such interventions to the clinic. In addition, potential applications of analyzing child-dog interactions are highlighted to screen for early signs of the disorder.},

OBJECTIVES: This analysis reviews all cases of acute arsenic toxicosis in cattle reported in the literature and describes cases from Purdue University that had a favorable outcome. Clinical presentation of the disease, treatments, and variables associated with survival are described. ANIMALS: One hundred and fifty-six cattle with arsenic toxicosis from 16 outbreaks. METHODS: Meta-analysis. RESULTS: The most common clinical signs were sudden death (68\%), diarrhea (33\%), ataxia (29\%), dehydration (22\%), and respiratory distress (4\%). The most common clinicopathologic abnormalities included azotemia (100\%), hematuria (100\%), increased liver enzyme activity (86\%), and increased hematocrit (60\%). One percent of cattle survived and the survival time for nonsurvivors ranged from 20 hours to 21 days. None of the clinical signs or clinicopathologic findings was associated with survival. Treatment was attempted in 24\% of cases and was not associated with survival (P = .055), but administration of an antidote and administration of fluids were associated with better outcome (P = .036 and P = .009, respectively). In the animals presented to Purdue University, treatment with IV fluids and sodium thiosulfate resulted in decreased blood arsenic concentrations in all animals (P = .009) and a survival rate of 50\%. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Although acute arsenic toxicosis has a poor prognosis, survival is possible if aggressive fluid therapy and antidotes are administered.},

However, it is unclear whether mothers 'program' offspring behavioural coping strategy (proactive/reactive) according to the predicted nutritional quality of their future environment. We conducted a systematic review on this topic and meta-analytically synthesized relevant experimental data on mice and rats (46 studies). We included data from experiments where dams were subjected to caloric restriction, protein restriction or overfeeding around gestation and subsequently measured offspring activity, exploration, or anxiety. Overall, little evidence existed for effects of maternal nutrition on the three investigated behavioural traits. The high heterogeneity observed in the data set suggests that maternal programming may sometimes occur. However, because offspring had access to a balanced diet before testing, behaviours may have been reprogrammed. Our results may indicate that reprogrammed behaviours could ameliorate negative effects associated with sub-optimal nutrition in early life. Further, our systematic review revealed clear knowledge gaps and fruitful future research avenues.},

The survey covers 193 scientific articles published during the years 1981-2010, as well as preclinical studies leading to the approval of mAb drugs by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States. The frequency of the articles has decreased by more than two- thirds from their highs in the late 1980's, and the aggregate number of chimpanzees used in these studies has decreased by more than 90\%. The experimental protocols ranged from single or multiple blood draws to extraction of body fluids and tissue samples, and to multiple, repeated organ biopsies. Many studies involved infecting the chimpanzee(s) with pathogenic organisms and immunization and infusion protocols. Addressing the health history and status of the chimpanzees was an exception rather than the rule, and anesthesia and analgesia were mentioned only in a small minority of the surveyed articles. In the past two decades, the FDA has approved 32 mAb drugs, but only three of those drugs could be determined to involve the chimpanzee in the preclinical stage. Two of those three drugs have been withdrawn from the market due to their severe adverse effects in human patients. Available alternatives, together with ethical and economic reasons, suggest that the use of the chimpanzee in this manner may not be necessary or appropriate.},

Few cases (17) were found in which disorders were reported to have a direct link to a conformational or phenotypic trait. Forty-nine breeds of domestic horse were described as being predisposed to one or more inherited disorders, but such predispositions did not distinguish between genetic or environmental causes. There were few patterns in the number of disorders to which breeds were reportedly predisposed or in the extent to which disorders were researched.

	abstract = {A systematic review of the literature was performed with the objective to evaluate the effects of progesterone supplementation using a single intravaginal insert during timed artificial insemination (AI) programs on fertility in lactating dairy cows. A total of 25 randomized controlled studies including 8,285 supplemented cows and 8,398 untreated controls were included in the meta-analysis. Information regarding the presence of corpus luteum (CL) at the initiation of the synchronization protocol was available for 6,883 supplemented cows and 6,879 untreated controls in 21 experiments. Studies were classified based on service number (first AI vs. resynchronized AI), use of presynchronization (yes vs. no), and insemination of cows in estrus during the synchronization protocol (inseminated in estrus and timed AI vs. timed AI only). Reproductive outcomes of interest were pregnancy per AI (P/AI) measured on d 32 (27 to 42) and 60 (41 to 71) after AI, and pregnancy loss between d 32 and 60 of gestation. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted and treatment effect was summarized into a pooled risk ratio with the Knapp-Hartung modification (RRK+H). The effect of moderator variables was assessed using meta-regression analyses. Progesterone supplementation increased the risk of pregnancy on d 32 [RRK+H = 1.08; 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.02-1.14] and 60 after AI (RRK+H = 1.10; 95\% CI = 1.03-1.17). The benefit of progesterone supplementation was observed mainly in cows lacking a CL at the initiation of the timed AI program (d 60: RRK+H = 1.18; 95\% CI = 1.07-1.30) rather than those with CL (d 60: RRK+H = 1.06; 95\% CI = 0.99-1.12). Progesterone supplementation benefited P/AI in studies in which all cows were inseminated at timed AI (d 60: RRK+H = 1.20; 95\% CI = 1.10-1.29), but not in studies in which cows could be inseminated in estrus during the timed AI program (d 60: RRK+H = 1.04; 95\% CI = 0.92-1.16). Progesterone supplementation tended to reduce the risk of pregnancy loss (RRK+H = 0.84; 95\% CI = 0.67-1.00). Service number and presynchronization did not influence the effect of progesterone supplementation on fertility. In summary, progesterone supplementation using a single intravaginal insert during the timed AI program increased P/AI mostly in cows without CL and reduced the risk of pregnancy loss in lactating dairy cows. Insemination of cows in estrus during the synchronization protocol eliminated the benefit of supplemental progesterone on P/AI.},

The studies in the meta-analysis were only selected if they were randomised and controlled experiments using broilers without apparent disease and the results were published in peer-reviewed journals. 2. A total of 48 and 46 studies were included to assess probiotic effects on body weight gain (BWG) and feed efficiency, respectively. Probiotics increased BWG compared to controls (SMD = 0.661, 95\% CI 0.499-0.822) and improved FE (SMD = -0.281, 95\% CI -0.404 to -0.157) in the pooled standardised mean difference random effect model, considering the source of heterogeneity and publication biases. However, there are evidences of publication bias and heterogeneity, so the results of this meta-analysis should be considered with caution. Applying the Duval and Tweedie s trim and fill methods the adjusted value for BWG was 0.0594 (95\% CI -0.122 to 0.242), and the adjusted value for FE did not show any modifications. 3. The meta-analysis showed that application of probiotics via water resulted in greater BGW and FE than administration through the feed. The effect was not related to the use of mono-strain or multi-strain probiotics, although it may depend on the strain used. The number of broilers and the duration of the experiments had an impact on the outcomes. 4. Additional studies should be conducted with the aim to identify the covariates which can explain the differences in the estimated effect sizes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Appendicular osteosarcoma is the most common malignant primary canine bone tumor. When treated by amputation or tumor removal alone, median survival times (MST) do not exceed 5 months, with the majority of dogs suffering from metastatic disease. This period can be extended with adequate local intervention and adjuvant chemotherapy, which has become common practice. Several prognostic factors have been reported in many different studies, e.g. age, breed, weight, sex, neuter status, location of tumor, serum alkaline phosphatase (SALP), bone alkaline phosphatase (BALP), infection, percentage of bone length affected, histological grade or histological subtype of tumor. Most of these factors are, however, only reported as confounding factors in larger studies. Insight in truly significant prognostic factors at time of diagnosis may contribute to tailoring adjuvant therapy for individual dogs suffering from osteosarcoma. The objective of this study was to systematically review the prognostic factors that are described for canine appendicular osteosarcoma and validate their scientific importance. RESULTS: A literature review was performed on selected studies and eligible data were extracted. Meta-analyses were done for two of the three selected possible prognostic factors (SALP and location), looking at both survival time (ST) and disease free interval (DFI). The third factor (age) was studied in a qualitative manner. Both elevated SALP level and the (proximal) humerus as location of the primary tumor are significant negative prognostic factors for both ST and DFI in dogs with appendicular osteosarcoma. Increasing age was associated with shorter ST and DFI, however, was not statistically significant because information of this factor was available in only a limited number of papers. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated SALP and proximal humeral location are significant negative prognosticators for canine osteosarcoma.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Feline herpesvirus 1 is a highly contagious virus that affects many cats. Virus infection presents with flu-like signs and irritation of ocular and nasal regions. While cats can recover from active infections without medical treatment, examination by a veterinarian is recommended. Lysine supplementation appears to be a popular intervention (recommended by {\textgreater} 90 \% of veterinarians in cat hospitals). We investigated the scientific merit of lysine supplementation by systematically reviewing all relevant literature. METHODS: NCBI's PubMed database was used to search for published work on lysine and feline herpesvirus 1, as well as lysine and human herpesvirus 1. Seven studies on lysine and feline herpesvirus 1 (two in vitro studies and 5 studies with cats), and 10 publications on lysine and human herpesvirus 1 (three in vitro studies and 7 clinical trials) were included for qualitative analysis. RESULTS: There is evidence at multiple levels that lysine supplementation is not effective for the prevention or treatment of feline herpesvirus 1 infection in cats. Lysine does not have any antiviral properties, but is believed to act by lowering arginine levels. However, lysine does not antagonize arginine in cats, and evidence that low intracellular arginine concentrations would inhibit viral replication is lacking. Furthermore, lowering arginine levels is highly undesirable since cats cannot synthesize this amino acid themselves. Arginine deficiency will result in hyperammonemia, which may be fatal. In vitro studies with feline herpesvirus 1 showed that lysine has no effect on the replication kinetics of the virus. Finally, and most importantly, several clinical studies with cats have shown that lysine is not effective for the prevention or the treatment of feline herpesvirus 1 infection, and some even reported increased infection frequency and disease severity in cats receiving lysine supplementation. CONCLUSION: We recommend an immediate stop of lysine supplementation because of the complete lack of any scientific evidence for its efficacy.},

The objective of this article is to provide an analytical review of the effects of these anaesthetics on the cardiorespiratory parameters of birds. A literature search was conducted using the PubMed database. Eleven clinical trials were selected and evaluated using the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) Statement checklist. The two gases are comparable for most of the parameters. However, sevoflurane allowed a more rapid recovery, a smaller decrease in respiratory rate and caused fewer cardiac arrhythmias. Both gases generally induced a decrease in blood pressure, respiratory rate, and body temperature. They also caused a decrease in heart rate during the anaesthesia, the extent of which appeared to depend on the duration of the intervention and the gas concentration. Changes in respiratory parameters and blood gas values appeared to be related to the ventilation technique used (spontaneous or controlled).},

	abstract = {Phytase, a widely used feed additive in poultry diets, increases P availability and subsequently reduces inorganic-P supplementation and P-excretion. Phytase supplementation effect on P-retention in poultry has been investigated, but the effect sizes were highly variable. The present study's objective was to conduct several meta-analyses to quantitatively summarize the phytase effect on P-retention in broilers and layers. Data from 103 and 26 controlled experiments testing the phytase effect on P-retention were included in 2 separate meta-analyses for broilers and layers, respectively. The mean difference calculated by subtracting the means of P-retention for the control group from the phytase-supplemented group was chosen as an effect size estimate. Between-study variability (heterogeneity) of mean difference was estimated using random-effect models and had a significant effect (P {\textless} 0.01) in both broilers and layers. Therefore, random-effect models were extended to mixed-effect models to explain heterogeneity and obtain final phytase effect size estimates. Available dietary and bird variables were included as fixed effects in the mixed-effect models. The final broiler mixed-effect model included phytase dose and Ca-to-total-P ratio (Ca:tP), explaining 15.6\% of the heterogeneity. Other variables such as breed might further explain between-study variance. Broilers consuming control diets were associated with 48.4\% P-retention. Exogenous phytase supplementation at 1,039 FTU/kg of diet increased P-retention by 8.6 percentage units on average. A unit increase of phytase dose and Ca:tP from their means further increased P-retention. For layers, the final mixed-effect models included dietary Ca, age, and experimental period length. The variables explained 65.9\% of the heterogeneity. Layers receiving exogenous phytase at 371 FTU/kg were associated with a 5.02 percentage unit increase in P-retention. A unit increase in dietary Ca from its mean increased P-retention, whereas an increase in the experiment length and layer's age decreased P-retention. Phytase supplementation had a significant positive effect on P-retention in both broilers and layers, but effect sizes across studies were significantly heterogeneous due to differences in Ca contents, experiment length, bird age, and phytase dose.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis was performed to consolidate the results of studies which have evaluated the effects of Vitamin E supplementation during the dry period on the risk of retained foetal membranes (RFM) in the dairy cow. Twenty studies demonstrated a beneficial response to Vitamin E whilst 21 found no benefit and 3 reported an increase in the incidence of RFM in treated cows. The odds ratios (OR) of the available studies exhibited significant heterogeneity, so multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to enable the identification of factors associated with the response to Vitamin E supplementation. Our multivariable analysis included parity and Vitamin E supplementation (control/treated) in the model, because all other factors were co-linear. Results indicated that Vitamin E supplementation led to a reduction in the incidence of RFM. A second multivariable analysis was undertaken on a subset of the data including only supplemented cows to determine the influence of supplementation factors on the risk of RFM. All factors were co-linear with each other, therefore, only type of Vitamin E supplementation was included in this analysis. The regression model demonstrated that administration of the synthetic Vitamin E alpha-tocopheryl acetate was associated with a lower risk of RFM than treatment with natural Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) (P=0.047, OR=0.49), whereas the difference between the synthetic Vitamin E alpha-tocopherol acetate and natural Vitamin E just failed to attain statistical significance (P=0.059, OR=0.53). Overall the analyses indicate that Vitamin E supplementation during the dry period is associated with a reduced risk of RFM, and that the synthetic forms of Vitamin E are more effective than the natural compound.},

	abstract = {Giardia has a wide range of host species and is a common cause of diarrhoeal disease in humans and animals. Companion animals are able to transmit a range of zoonotic diseases to their owners including giardiasis, but the size of this risk is not well known. The aim of this study was to analyse giardiasis prevalence rates in dogs and cats worldwide using a systematic search approach. Meta-analysis enabled to describe associations between Giardia prevalence and various confounding factors. Pooled prevalence rates were 15.2\% (95\% CI 13.8-16.7\%) for dogs and 12\% (95\% CI 9.2-15.3\%) for cats. However, there was very high heterogeneity between studies. Meta-regression showed that the diagnostic method used had a major impact on reported prevalence with studies using ELISA, IFA and PCR reporting prevalence rates between 2.6 and 3.7 times greater than studies using microscopy. Conditional negative binomial regression found that symptomatic animals had higher prevalence rates ratios (PRR) than asymptomatic animals 1.61 (95\% CI 1.33-1.94) in dogs and 1.94 (95\% CI 1.47-2.56) in cats. Giardia was much more prevalent in young animals. For cats {\textgreater}6 months, PRR=0.47 (0.42-0.53) and in dogs of the same age group PRR=0.36 (0.32-0.41). Additionally, dogs kept as pets were less likely to be positive (PRR=0.56 (0.41-0.77)) but any difference in cats was not significant. Faecal excretion of Giardia is common in dogs and slightly less so in cats. However, the exact rates depend on the diagnostic method used, the age and origin of the animal. What risk such endemic colonisation poses to human health is still unclear as it will depend not only on prevalence rates but also on what assemblages are excreted and how people interact with their pets.},

DESIGN: Standardized, systematic evaluation of the literature, categorization of relevant articles according to level of evidence and quality, and development of consensus on conclusions for application of the concepts to clinical practice. Relevant questions were answered on a worksheet template and reviewed by the Reassessment Campaign on Veterinary Resuscitation (RECOVER) monitoring domain members, by the RECOVER committee and opened for comments by veterinary professionals for 3 months. SETTING: Academia, referral practice, and general practice. RESULTS: Eighteen worksheets evaluated monitoring practices relevant for diagnosing cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA), monitoring CPR efforts, identifying return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), and post-ROSC monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Although veterinary clinical trials are lacking, experimental literature using canine models and human clinical trials provided relevant data. The major conclusions from this analysis of the literature highlight the utility of end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO(2)) monitoring to identify ROSC and possibly to evaluate quality of CPR. In addition, recommendations for ECG analysis during CPR were addressed. Unless the patient is instrumented at the time of CPA, other monitoring devices (eg, Doppler flow probe) are likely not useful for diagnosis of CPA, and the possibility of pulseless electrical activity makes ECG inappropriate as a sole diagnostic tool. Optimal monitoring of the intra- and postcardiac arrest patient remains to be determined in clinical veterinary medicine, and further evaluation of the prognostic and prescriptive utility of EtCO(2) monitoring will provide material for future studies in veterinary CPR.},

CONCLUSIONS: Nontraditional assays identified included thrombelastography (TEG)-PlateletMapping (PM), functional fibrinogen assessment, and rapid-TEG (r-TEG). Direct veterinary evidence was found for only the ADP-activated PM, which appears to generate valid data in dogs but not cats or horses. Arachidonic acid activated PM shows high variability and requires further assessment and validation in veterinary species. Functional fibrinogen assays may be performed in veterinary species but may require modification due to species differences in response to abciximab. While tissue factor (TF)-activated TEG has been well described in the veterinary literature, the specific r-TEG assay has not been assessed, but presumably would be effective for generating TEG tracings and values for maximum amplitude and angle in shorter periods of time than some traditional assays.},

Yet there is a lack of scientifically based evidence to confirm this animal health status. This paper reviews what has been published on diseases of domestic animals in the Pacific Islands region with a particular focus on data from the last 20 years (1992-2012). Relevant published papers were identified by a computerized literature search of two electronic databases (PubMed and Web of Knowledge). The latest reports on the animal health situation submitted by the PICTs to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) were accessed on the World Animal Health Information Database (WAHID) interface and included in this review. Additionally, paper searches of resources were undertaken at the library of the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) in Fiji to retrieve any relevant grey literature for this review. The study eligibility criteria included qualitative or quantitative information on any disease (bacterial, viral, parasitic and other health disorders) affecting domestic terrestrial animals (mammals, reptiles, birds and bees) in any of the 22 PICTs members of the SPC. A total of 158 eligible references were retrieved of which only 77 (48.7\%) were published since 1992 and analysed in more details. One hundred and one diseases and pathogens were reported on for bee, bird, carabao, cat, cattle, crocodile, deer, dog, donkey, goat, horse, pig, pigeon, poultry and sheep in the Oceania region and in 17 PICTs in particular. The paper gives information about known animal diseases, their reported prevalence and diseases not reported within the Pacific Islands region. The study found retrieved literature on animal diseases in PICTs was scarce and no longer up to date. There is a need to improve the published knowledge on the current animal disease status in the region.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12888-018-1613-2},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is increasing recognition of the therapeutic function pets can play in relation to mental health. However, there has been no systematic review of the evidence related to the comprehensive role of companion animals and how pets might contribute to the work associated with managing a long-term mental health condition. The aim of this study was to explore the extent, nature and quality of the evidence implicating the role and utility of pet ownership for people living with a mental health condition. METHODS: A systematic search for studies exploring the role of companion animals in the management of mental health conditions was undertaken by searching 9 databases and undertaking a scoping review of grey literature from the earliest record until March 2017. To be eligible for inclusion, studies had to be published in English and report on primary data related to the relationship between domestic animal ownership and the management of diagnosable mental health conditions. Synthesis of qualitative and quantitative data was undertaken in parallel using a narrative synthesis informed by an illness work theoretical framework. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies were included in the review. Quantitative evidence relating to the benefits of pet ownership was mixed with included studies demonstrating positive, negative and neutral impacts of pet ownership. Qualitative studies illuminated the intensiveness of connectivity people with companion animals reported, and the multi-faceted ways in which pets contributed to the work associated with managing a mental health condition, particularly in times of crisis. The negative aspects of pet ownership were also highlighted, including the practical and emotional burden of pet ownership and the psychological impact that losing a pet has. CONCLUSION: This review suggests that pets provide benefits to those with mental health conditions. Further research is required to test the nature and extent of this relationship, incorporating outcomes that cover the range of roles and types of support pets confer in relation to mental health and the means by which these can be incorporated into the mainstay of support for people experiencing a mental health problem.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This systematic review aimed to present and critically appraise the available information on the efficacy of platelet rich plasma (PRP) in equine and human orthopedic therapeutics and to verify the influence of study design and methodology on the assumption of PRP's efficacy. We searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, Bireme and Google Scholar without restrictions until July 2013. Randomized trials, human cohort clinical studies or case series with a control group on the use of PRP in tendons, ligaments or articular lesions were included. Equine clinical studies on the same topics were included independently of their design. Experimental studies relevant to the clarification of PRP's effects and mechanisms of action in tissues of interest, conducted in any animal species, were selected. RESULTS: This review included 123 studies. PRP's beneficial effects were observed in 46.7\% of the clinical studies, while the absence of positive effects was observed in 43.3\%. Among experimental studies, 73\% yielded positive results, and 7.9\% yielded negative results. The most frequent flaws in the clinical trials' designs were the lack of a true placebo group, poor product characterization, insufficient blinding, small sampling, short follow-up periods, and adoption of poor outcome measures. The methods employed for PRP preparation and administration and the selected outcome measures varied greatly. Poor study design was a common feature of equine clinical trials. From studies in which PRP had beneficial effects, 67.8\% had an overall high risk of bias. From the studies in which PRP failed to exhibit beneficial effects, 67.8\% had an overall low risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Most experimental studies revealed positive effects of PRP. Although the majority of equine clinical studies yielded positive results, the human clinical trials' results failed to corroborate these findings. In both species, beneficial results were more frequently observed in studies with a high risk of bias. The use of PRP in musculoskeletal lesions, although safe and promising, has still not shown strong evidence in clinical scenarios.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: The results of individual studies investigating the efficacy of chilling and other processing interventions on Salmonella prevalence or concentration in broiler chicken carcasses are inconsistent or contradictory. OBJECTIVE: Determine efficacy of chilling on reducing Salmonella prevalence or concentration on broiler carcasses using systematic review-meta-analysis, and explore sources of heterogeneity among studies investigating various processing interventions through meta-regression. DATA SOURCES: A comprehensive search included electronic search in six databases, manual search of reference lists of topic-related articles, and consultation with five topic experts to assure that all relevant intervention research was identified. STUDY INCLUSION: Primary intervention research, published in English, encompassing control, challenge, cohort, or before-and-after study designs investigating the efficacy of any chilling or other processing interventions on Salmonella prevalence or concentration in broiler chicken carcasses. RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT AND DATA EXTRACTION: Data pertaining to study methodology and reported results, chilling or other processing intervention parameters, populations sampled and outcomes measured were assessed for methodological soundness and extracted by two independent reviewers using pretested checklists. RESULTS: Random-effects meta-analyses of immersion chilling with chlorine (n=9 trials), acetic acid (n=16) and potable water (n=13) trended towards reductions in the odds or log(10)CFU/ml of Salmonella. Significant heterogeneity (P-value{\textless}/=0.1 and I(2){\textgreater}25\%) precluded the reporting of pooled summary effect estimates. Meta-regression of all processing interventions indicated that serotype, disinfectant type and treatment time and pH were significantly associated with studies reporting reductions in concentration while study design, population sampled, study setting, publication date, intervention and disinfectant type, and treatment pH were significantly associated with studies reporting reductions in prevalence. Methodological and reporting flaws were consistently observed in relevant intervention research as well as a lack of studies conducted under commercial conditions and using Salmonella concentration outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Chilling may be effective at reducing Salmonella concentration and prevalence, but significant heterogeneity precluded reporting of pooled summary effect estimates for many chilling interventions. Investigations into potential sources of heterogeneity among all processing interventions found that the use of other chemical disinfectants, such as organic acids and surfactants might result in larger reductions in Salmonella contamination than more commonly utilized oxidizing agents like chlorine.},

	abstract = {Context: Broiler chicken carcass spray and dip treatments are just two of many different interventions investigated to address the need to reduce \_Salmonella\_ prevalence and concentration on broiler chicken carcasses during processing. However the results of published research are inconsistent and sometimes contradictory creating a need to formally evaluate, synthesize and summarize available research to avoid recommending ineffective treatments and identify key knowledge gaps for future work. Objective: Evaluate intervention research that measured the efficacy of various spray and dip treatments, applied on broiler chicken carcasses during primary processing, as \_Salmonella\_ prevalence or concentration on broiler carcasses, using systematic review-meta-analysis (SR-MA). Data sources: A comprehensive electronic search was implemented in six databases and verified through a manual search of topic-related reference lists, related reviews or book chapters, and through consultations with selected topic experts. Study inclusion: Control and challenge trials, cohort and before-and-after intervention research published in English that investigated the efficacy of any spray or dip treatments, applied to broiler chicken carcasses or carcass parts during processing, on \_Salmonella\_ prevalence or concentration measured at the same level under laboratory, pilot plant and commercial conditions. Risk of bias assessment and data extraction: Relevant research was evaluated for methodological soundness and completeness of reporting. The main characteristics of each study included in the review were extracted. Data analysis: Random-effects MA of trisodium phosphate and lactic acid dip treatments (\_n\_=12 and \_n\_=32 trials with prevalence outcomes, respectively) resulted in homogeneous (\_p\_-value=0.469; \_I\_²=0.0\% and \_p\_-value=0.284; \_I\_²=11.4\%, respectively) summary effect estimates (OR=1.16; 95\% CI: 0.59-2.26 and OR=0.05; 95\% CI: 0.03-0.10, respectively). Visual evaluation of MA forest plots indicated overall reduction trends for six spray treatments reporting concentration outcomes: trisodium phosphate (\_n\_=48 trials), acidic electrolyzed oxidizing water (\_n\_=2), cetylpyridinium chloride (\_n\_=43), lactic acid (\_n\_=24), sodium bisulfate (\_n\_=11) and potable water (\_n\_=36). Moderate to considerable heterogeneity (\_p\_-value {\textless}=0.1 and \_I\_²{\textgreater}25\%) was observed for these treatments. Methodological soundness of included studies was poor and a lack of studies conducted under commercial conditions was observed. Conclusions: Existing research on the efficacy of broiler carcass dips or sprays on \_Salmonella\_ prevalence or concentration is limited and heterogeneous, precluding the full benefits of robust meta-analyses. Larger randomized controlled trials conducted under commercial conditions are needed.},

	abstract = {Bacterial endocarditis (BE) is the most common valvular disease in cattle but diagnosis in the living animal remains a challenge for clinicians. The objective of the study was to report evidence-based veterinary medicine data concerning the clinical presentation and results of ancillary tests of necropsy-confirmed cases of bovine BE. A systematic review and subsequent meta-analysis was performed using Medline and CAB abstracts of every article on bovine BE published in English, Japanese, German and French. The clinical criteria that were specifically assessed for diagnosis of BE were: tachycardia, heart murmur, signs of congestive heart failure, presence of fever, evidence of lameness/polyarthritis, one or more positive blood cultures and positive echocardiograms for BE. A total of 34 studies (460 cases of BE) satisfied the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. The sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and 95\% confidence interval (CI) were obtained using a random-effect meta-analysis for studies reporting five or more cases. The Se (95\% CI) were 86.9\% (39.1-98.6\%) for positive haemoculture, 84.3\% (60.4-95.0\%) for echocardiography, 79.7\% (70.1-86.8\%) for the presence of tachycardia, 60.3\% (51.8-68.3\%) for the presence of a murmur, 45.7\% (32.5-59.5\%) for the presence of fever, 43.5\% (25.6-63.3\%) for the presence of lameness/polyarthritis, and 37.3\% (21.6-57.0\%) for the presence of clinical signs of heart failure. The Sp (95\% CI) was 95.3\% (93.3-96.8\%) for lameness, 72.6\% (45.8-89.2\%) for the presence of a murmur, 67.0\% (55.5-76.7\%) for the presence of fever, and 27.1\% (14.3-45.2\%) for the presence of tachycardia. This meta-analysis confirmed that the diagnosis of BE is a difficult process. Echocardiography seems to be a sensitive diagnostic tool despite the absence of any consensus on the ultrasonographic definition of the disease. However, from these results, it was impossible to determine whether multiple positive findings or clinical tests increase the sensitivity for the diagnosis of bovine BE.},

Specifically, the article examines similarities and differences between the two viruses in their genetic characteristics, distribution patterns in human and bird populations and postulated mechanisms of global spread. In summary, H5N1 is pathogenic in birds, while H7N9 is not. Yet both have caused sporadic human cases, without evidence of sustained, human-to-human spread. The number of H7N9 human cases in the first year following its emergence far exceeded that of H5N1 over the same time frame. Despite the higher incidence of H7N9, the spatial distribution of H5N1 within a comparable time frame is considerably greater than that of H7N9, both within China and globally. The pattern of spread of H5N1 in humans and birds around the world is consistent with spread through wild bird migration and poultry trade activities. In contrast, human cases of H7N9 and isolations of H7N9 in birds and the environment have largely occurred in a number of contiguous provinces in south-eastern China. Although rates of contact with birds appear to be similar in H5N1 and H7N9 cases, there is a predominance of incidental contact reported for H7N9 as opposed to close, high-risk contact for H5N1. Despite the high number of human cases of H7N9 and the assumed transmission being from birds, the corresponding level of H7N9 virus in birds in surveillance studies has been low, particularly in poultry farms. H7N9 viruses are also diversifying at a much greater rate than H5N1 viruses. Analyses of certain H7N9 strains demonstrate similarities with engineered transmissible H5N1 viruses which make it more adaptable to the human respiratory tract. These differences in the human and bird epidemiology of H5N1 and H7N9 raise unanswered questions as to how H7N9 has spread, which should be investigated further.},

This raises a question about the role of birds in the spread and transmission of H7N9 to humans. We conducted a meta-analysis of overall prevalence of H5N1 and H7N9 in different bird populations (domestic poultry, wild birds) and different environments (live bird markets, commercial poultry farms, wild habitats). The electronic database, Scopus, was searched for published papers, and Google was searched for country surveillance reports. A random effect meta-analysis model was used to produce pooled estimates of the prevalence of H5N1 and H7N9 for various subcategories. A random effects logistic regression model was used to compare prevalence rates between H5N1 and H7N9. Both viruses have low prevalence across all bird populations. Significant differences in prevalence rates were observed in domestic birds, farm settings, for pathogen and antibody testing, and during routine surveillance. Random effects logistic regression analyses show that among domestic birds, the prevalence of H5N1 is 47.48 (95\% CI: 17.15-133.13, P {\textless} 0.001) times higher than H7N9. In routine surveillance (where surveillance was not conducted in response to human infections or bird outbreaks), the prevalence of H5N1 is still higher than H7N9 with an OR of 43.02 (95\% CI: 16.60-111.53, P {\textless} 0.001). H7N9 in humans has occurred at a rate approximately four times higher than H5N1, and for both infections, birds are postulated to be the source. Much lower rates of H7N9 in birds compared to H5N1 raise doubts about birds as the sole source of high rates of human H7N9 infection. Other sources of transmission of H7N9 need to be considered and explored.},

Antimicrobials in pig production are usually administered per pen via feed which implies treatment of sick alongside with healthy animals. The objective of this systematic literature review was to investigate the effect of orally administered antimicrobials on AMR in Escherichia coli of swine. Studies published in peer reviewed journals were retrieved from the international online databases ISI Web of Knowledge, PubMed, Scopus and the national electronic literature data base of Deutsches Institut fur Medizinische Dokumentation und Information. The studies were assessed using the eligibility criteria English or German language, access to full paper version, defined treatment and control group (initial value or non-treatment) as well as administration and resistance testing of the same antimicrobial class. In the qualitative synthesis, only studies were included presenting the summary measures odds ratio or prevalence of resistance, the category of the applied antimicrobial and the dosage. An effect of the antimicrobial on AMR in E. coli was evaluated as an "increase", "no effect" or "decrease" if the odds or alternatively the prevalence ratio were {\textgreater}1.0, 1.0 or {\textless}1.0, respectively. Eleven studies, describing 36 different trials, fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were finally assessed. An increase of AMR in E. coli was found in 10 out of 11 trials comparing AMR after with AMR prior to oral treatment and in 22 of the 25 trials comparing orally treated with untreated groups. Effects expressed as odds or prevalence ratios were highest for the use of aminoglycosides, quinolones and tetracycline. There was no clear association between the reported dosage and AMR towards tetracycline. Information on antimicrobial substance and dosage was missing in 4 and 5 of the 11 finally selected studies. The 36 identified trials were inhomogenous in usage and provision of information on sample size. Oral administration of antimicrobials increases the risk of AMR in E. coli from swine. There is however a lack of studies on the impact of dosage and longitudinal effects of treatment. The published studies have a number of issues concerning their scientific quality. More high quality research is needed to better address and quantifiy the effect of orally administered antimicrobials on AMR in swine.},

We systematically reviewed the scientific and gray literature and used the United Nations Environment Programme – World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) trade database to establish temporal and geographical trade patterns of live exotic birds, mammals, and reptiles and to describe trends in research, taxonomic representation, and level of threat and legal protection of species traded. Birds were the most species-rich and abundant class reported in trade; reptiles were second most abundant but unusually the most studied in this context; and mammals were least abundant in trade. Mammalian and reptilian species traded as pets were more likely to be threatened than expected by random. There have been a substantial number of Appendix I listed captive-bred mammals and birds and wild-caught birds and reptiles reported in trade to CITES. We identified the Middle East's emerging role as a driver of demand for exotic pets of all taxa alongside the well-established and increasing role of South America and Southeast Asia in the market. Europe, North America, and the Middle East featured most heavily in trade reports to CITES, whereas trade involving South America and Southeast Asia were given most emphasis in the literature. For effective monitoring of and appropriate response to the international exotic pet trade, it is imperative that the reliability and detail of CITES trade reports improve and that scientific research be directed toward those taxa and locations that are most vulnerable.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The system of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated proteins (cas) is a new technology that allows easier manipulation of the genome. Its potential to edit genes opened a new door in treatment development for incurable neurological monogenic diseases (NMGDs). The aim of this systematic review was to summarise the findings on the current development of CRISPR-cas for therapeutic purposes in the most frequent NMGDs and provide critical assessment. METHODS AND DATA ACQUISITION: We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases, looking for original studies on the use of CRISPR-cas to edit pathogenic variants in models of the most frequent NMGDs, until end of 2017. We included all the studies that met the following criteria: 1. Peer-reviewed study report with explicitly described experimental designs; 2. In vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo study using human or other animal biological systems (including cells, tissues, organs, organisms); 3. focusing on CRISPR as the gene-editing method of choice; and 5. featured at least one NMGD. RESULTS: We obtained 404 papers from MEDLINE and 513 from EMBASE. After removing the duplicates, we screened 490 papers by title and abstract and assessed them for eligibility. After reading 50 full-text papers, we finally selected 42 for the review. DISCUSSION: Here we give a systematic summary on the preclinical development of CRISPR-cas for therapeutic purposes in NMGDs. Furthermore, we address the clinical interpretability of the findings, giving a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy (DMD) paves the way forward, with 26 out of 42 studies reporting different strategies on DMD gene editing in different models of the disease. Most of the strategies aimed for permanent exon skipping by deletion with CRISPR-cas. Successful silencing of the mHTT gene with CRISPR-cas led to successful reversal of the neurotoxic effects in the striatum of mouse models of Huntington's disease. Many other strategies have been explored, including epigenetic regulation of gene expression, in cellular and animal models of: myotonic dystrophy, Fraxile X syndrome, ataxias, and other less frequent dystrophies. Still, before even considering the clinical application of CRISPR-cas, three major bottlenecks need to be addressed: efficacy, safety, and delivery of the systems. This requires a collaborative approach in the research community, while having ethical considerations in mind.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Cultural competency is a cornerstone of patient-centered health care. Religious doctrines may define appropriate consumption or use of certain animals and forbid use of others. Many medications contain ingredients that are animal-derived; these medications may be unacceptable to individual patients within the context of their religious beliefs and lifestyle choices. Knowledge of animal-derived medications as a component of cultural competency can facilitate a dialogue that shifts focus from the group to the individual, away from cultural competency toward cultural humility, and away from a paternalistic provider/patient dynamic toward one of partnership. OBJECTIVES: To explore how animal-derived drug components may impact medication selection and acceptability from the perspective of patients, physicians, and religious leaders as evidenced by studies that explore the question via survey or questionnaire. A secondary objective is to use the context of animal-derived drug products as a component of cultural competency to build a framework supporting the development of cultural humility. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in the PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane, and ProQuest databases using combinations of the following terms: "medication selection," "medication," "adherence," "pharmaceutical preparations," "religion and medicine," "religion," "animal," "dietary," "porcine," and "bovine." Studies that reported using surveys or questionnaires to examine patient, physician, or religious leader perspective on animal-derived medications published in English between 1990 and 2020 were included. Review articles, opinion pieces, case reports, surveys of persons other than patients, religious leaders, or physicians, and studies published in languages other than English were excluded. Three authors independently reviewed articles to extract information pertaining to perspectives on animal-based medication ingredients. RESULTS: Eight studies meeting the described criteria were found that queried beliefs or knowledge of patients, religious leaders, or physicians regarding medications and medical products of biologic origin. Those studies are described in full in this review. CONCLUSIONS: Knowledge of animal-derived ingredients may help open conversations with patients around spiritual history and cultural competency, particularly for those patients belonging to religious sects with doctrines that define appropriate use of human- or animal-derived products. Further formal study is needed to explore more fully the extent to which religious beliefs may impact selection of animal- or human-derived medications. Guidelines developed from this knowledge may aid in identifying individual patients with whom the discussion may be particularly relevant. More studies are needed to quantify and qualify beliefs regarding animal-derived medication constituents.},

	abstract = {In humans, the majority of sustained traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are classified as 'mild' and most often a result of a closed head injury (CHI). The effects of a non-penetrating CHI are not benign and may lead to chronic pathology and behavioral dysfunction, which could be worsened by repeated head injury. Clinical-neuropathological correlation studies provide evidence that conversion of tau into abnormally phosphorylated proteotoxic intermediates (p-tau) could be part of the pathophysiology triggered by a single TBI and enhanced by repeated TBIs. However, the link between p-tau and CHI in rodents remains controversial. To address this question experimentally, we induced a single CHI or two CHIs to WT or rTg4510 mice. We found that 2× CHI increased tau phosphorylation in WT mice and rTg4510 mice. Behavioral characterization in WT mice found chronic deficits in the radial arm water maze in 2× CHI mice that had partially resolved in the 1× CHI mice. Moreover, using Manganese-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging with R1 mapping - a novel functional neuroimaging technique - we found greater deficits in the rTg4510 mice following 2× CHI compared to 1× CHI. To integrate our findings with prior work in the field, we conducted a systematic review of rodent mild repetitive CHI studies. Following Prisma guidelines, we identified 25 original peer-reviewed papers. Results from our experiments, as well as our systematic review, provide compelling evidence that tau phosphorylation is modified by experimental mild TBI studies; however, changes in p-tau levels are not universally reported. Together, our results provide evidence that repetitive TBIs can result in worse and more persistent neurological deficits compared to a single TBI, but the direct link between the worsened outcome and elevated p-tau could not be established.},

	abstract = {Wild animals are the source of many pathogens of livestock and humans. Concerns about the potential transmission of economically important and zoonotic diseases from wildlife have led to increased surveillance at the livestock-wildlife interface. Knowledge of the types, frequency and duration of contacts between livestock and wildlife is necessary to identify risk factors for disease transmission and to design possible mitigation strategies. Observing the behaviour of many wildlife species is challenging due to their cryptic nature and avoidance of humans, meaning there are relatively few studies in this area. Further, a consensus on the definition of what constitutes a 'contact' between wildlife and livestock is lacking. A systematic review was conducted to investigate which livestock-wildlife contacts have been studied and why, as well as the methods used to observe each species. Over 30,000 publications were screened, of which 122 fulfilled specific criteria for inclusion in the analysis. The majority of studies examined cattle contacts with badgers or with deer; studies involving wild pig contacts with cattle or with domestic pigs were the next most frequent. There was a range of observational methods including motion-activated cameras and global positioning system collars. As a result of the wide variation and lack of consensus in the definitions of direct and indirect contacts, we developed a unified framework to define livestock-wildlife contacts that is sufficiently flexible to be applied to most wildlife and livestock species for non-vector-borne diseases. We hope this framework will help standardise the collection and reporting of contact data; a valuable step towards being able to compare the efficacy of wildlife-livestock observation methods. In doing so, it may aid the development of better disease transmission models and improve the design and effectiveness of interventions to reduce or prevent disease transmission.},

Studies have reported different patterns of change following PNS in BDNF, which emphasizes the complexity of the issue. In this review, systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Cochrane CENTRAL databases was performed. Primary searches resulted in 2132 studies and finally 43 studies were found to meet the inclusion criteria. Transcriptional and epigenetic changes of BDNF gene in the brain were recorded. Decreased or unchanged BDNF total mRNA and BDNF mature protein, with hypermethylation of the coding exons were the most reported changes. However, stress paradigm, gender of the fetus and the day of sacrifice were found to significantly affect the results. Hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are the most vulnerable regions. They can show long lasting and persistent transcriptional and epigenetics changes of BDNF gene following PNS. Further studies evaluating the importance of these findings in humans are essential.},

	abstract = {Low-grade canine cutaneous mast cell tumour (cMCT) with metastasis at the time of treatment is uncommonly reported, with few studies focusing on this specific clinical entity. The specific objective of this study was to systematically review the veterinary literature and perform a meta-analysis summarizing the clinical presentation, treatments reported and clinical outcomes from dogs with histologically low-grade cMCT and metastasis present at initial treatment. A total of 980 studies were screened with eight publications providing data on 121 dogs ultimately included. The most common treatments were surgery with adjuvant chemotherapy in 83/121 (69\%) dogs; combined surgery, radiation and chemotherapy in 17/121 (14\%) dogs; chemotherapy alone in 12/121 (10\%) dogs and surgery alone in 7/121 (6\%) dogs. Dogs with distant metastasis (n = 22) experienced significantly shorter survival compared with those with regional lymph node (RLN) metastasis (n = 99; median 194 vs 637 days; P {\textless} .01). Two variables were significantly associated with increased risk of death: presence of distant (vs RLN) metastasis (hazard ratio = 2.60; P {\textless} .01) and not receiving surgery as a component of treatment (hazard ratio = 3.79; P {\textless} .01). Risk of bias was judged to be low in terms of selection and performance bias but high in terms of detection and exclusion bias. In conclusion, dogs with cMCT and RLN metastasis can be expected to live significantly longer than those with distant metastasis, and surgery appears to have a role in extending survival of metastatic low-grade cMCT.},

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to quantify the overall effect of inorganic NO(3), administered via drinking water, on body weight gain in rats. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases, and the reference lists of published papers. Experiments on male rats, reported data on body weight in NO(3)-treated animals and controls, were included for quality assessment, meta-analyses, subgroup analyses, and meta-regressions. Of 173 initially obtained studies, 11 were eligible to be included in the analyses, which covered the years 2004 to 2019 and included a total of 43 intervention (n=395) and 43 control (n=395) arms. Overall, the final body weights were significantly lower in the NO(3)-supplemented groups compared to controls (WMD= -16.8 g, 95 \% CI= -27.38, -6.24; P=0.002). Doses of NO(3) higher than the median ({\textgreater} 72.94 mg L(-1) d(-1)) and longer NO(3) exposure ({\textgreater} 8 weeks) resulted in greater mean differences (WMD= -31.92 g, 95 \% CI= -52.90, -10.94 and WMD= -23.16 g, 95 \% CI= -35.64, -10.68 g). After exclusion of experiments using high doses of NO(3) ({\textgreater} 400 mg L(-1) d(-1)), the overall mean differences in body weights between the groups decreased by approximately 37 \% but remained statistically significant (WMD= -10.11 g, 95 \% CI= -19.04, -1.19, P=0.026). Mean changes in body weight were affected by age, baseline values in body weight, and the duration of the studies. These preliminary experimental findings strongly support the hypothesis that NO(3) can be considered as a natural anti-obesity agent.},

This could be attributed to induction of neuroapoptosis and inhibition of neurogenesis by several mechanisms, with a pivotal role of microRNAs in this milieu. MicroRNAs are critical regulators of gene expression that are differentially expressed in response to internal and external environmental stimuli, including general anesthetics. Through this systematic review, we aimed at summarizing the current knowledge apropos of the roles and implications of deregulated microRNAs pertaining to anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity in animal models and derived neuronal cultures. OVID/Medline and PubMed databases were lastly searched on April 1st, 2019, using the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) or Title/Abstract words ("microRNA" and "anesthesia"), to identify all published research studies on microRNAs and anesthesia. During the review process, data abstraction and methodological assessment was done by independent groups of reviewers. In total, 29 studies were recognized to be eligible and were thus involved in this systematic review. Anesthetic agents studied included sevoflurane, isoflurane, propofol, bupivacaine, and ketamine. More than 40 microRNAs were identified to have regulatory roles in anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity. This field of study still comprises several gaps that should be filled by conducting basic, clinical, and translational research in the future to decipher the exact role of microRNAs and their functions in the context of anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity.},

METHODS: Fifty articles were extracted including Iranian papers such as Google scholar, Magiran, Iran Medex, SID, and Pubmed. Out of these, 21 articles were selected for meta-analysis. Essential information for meta-analysis was extracted from papers and archived in Excel software for calculating by statistical analysis. The variance of each study was obtained using the binomial distribution. Heterogeneity of the studies was surveyed using I2 index. Data were analyzed using a random effect model. RESULTS: Of 21 collected papers, 1,275,506 samples from cow (507,152), sheep (454,882), goat (207,925), and human (105,547) had been surveyed in Iran. Eight studies were conducted on humans and 13 on animals. The prevalence rate obtained in humans was 3\% with a confidence interval (CI) of 95\% (1\%-7\%). Prevalence rate obtained in cows, sheep, and goats was 13\% with CI of 95\% (10\%-16\%). The highest level of prevalence was reported from cities in the North in animals with a prevalence of 14\%. The highest level of prevalence was reported from Gilan in humans with a prevalence of 0.1\%. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of the Fascioliasis in Iran has reduced in recent years, But the importance of the disease has not reduced and there is a possibility of an epidemic.

	abstract = {Background and Purpose- Brain electrical stimulation, widely studied to facilitate recovery from stroke, has also been reported to confer direct neuroprotection in preclinical models of acute cerebral ischemia. Systematic review of controlled preclinical acute cerebral ischemia studies would aid in planning for initial human clinical trials. Methods- A systematic Medline search identified controlled, preclinical studies of central nervous system electrical stimulation in acute cerebral ischemia. Studies were categorized among 6 stimulation strategies. Three strategies applied different stimulation types to tissues within the ischemic zone (cathodal hemispheric stimulation [CHS], anodal hemispheric stimulation, and pulsed hemispheric stimulation), and 3 strategies applied deep brain stimulation to different neuronal targets remote from the ischemic zone (fastigial nucleus stimulation, subthalamic vasodilator area stimulation, and dorsal periaqueductal gray stimulation). Random-effects meta-analysis assessed electrical stimulation modification of final infarct volume. Study-level risk of bias and intervention-level readiness-for-translation were assessed using formal rating scales. Results- Systematic search identified 28 experiments in 21 studies, including a total of 350 animals, of electrical stimulation in preclinical acute cerebral ischemia. Overall, in animals undergoing electrical stimulation, final infarct volumes were reduced by 37\% (95\% CI, 34\%-40\%; P{\textless}0.001), compared with control. There was evidence of heterogeneity of efficacy among stimulation strategies (I(2)=93.1\%, P(heterogeneity){\textless}0.001). Among the within-ischemic zone stimulation strategies, only CHS significantly reduced the infarct volume (27 \%; 95\% CI, 22\%-33\%; P{\textless}0.001); among the remote-from ischemic zone approaches, all (fastigial nucleus stimulation, subthalamic vasodilator area stimulation, and dorsal periaqueductal gray stimulation) reduced infarct volumes by approximately half. On formal rating scales, CHS studies had the lowest risk of bias, and CHS had the highest overall quality of intervention-level evidence supporting readiness to proceed to clinical testing. Conclusions- Electrical stimulation reduces final infarct volume across preclinical studies. CHS shows the most robust evidence and is potentially appropriate for progression to early-stage human clinical trial testing as a promising neuroprotective intervention.},

	abstract = {A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to identify, evaluate, and synthesize primary literature reporting the efficacy of anthelmintic drugs in cattle. Information on the bibliographic data, anthelmintic drugs, animals, reduction method, days after application, parasite genera, type of application, and dosage were collected. The final data base was composed of 70 articles published between 1986 and 2016 with a total of 8,976 animals. The mode of application interfered with the efficacy of anthelmintic drugs in cattle (P{\textless}0.05); oral application was superior to injectable and pour-on drugs. The combined use of drugs was superior to single macrocyclic lactones including ivermectin (P{\textless}0.05), in this way the combined use was more effective than the single use of drugs for the control of gastro-intestinal nematodes in cattle (P{\textless}0.05). Nematode genera in the abomasum (Ostertagia spp., Haemonchus spp.) and intestine (Cooperia spp.) were evaluated. Levamisole had a greater efficacy for Cooperia spp. than Ostertagia spp. (P{\textless}0.05); ivermectin had a greater efficacy for Ostertagia spp. than Haemonchus spp. (P{\textless}0.05); doramectin had a greater efficacy for Ostertagia spp. than Cooperia spp. (P{\textless}0.05). Dosing in larger quantities and according to the manufacturer's recommendation was most efficient, and the dose limiting species differed between substance classes. The test based on the count of eggs per gram of faeces indicated a reduced efficacy of the drug as days passed following treatment. The forest plot did not show a difference (P{\textgreater}0.05) between interventions (resistance and efficacy). The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that anthelmintic resistance in cattle is present on several continents. Therefore, there is a need to replace the schemes based on the exclusive use of drugs in order to decrease the selection pressure.},

Meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled Odds Ratio and 95\% Confidence Intervals. Of the 1504 abstracts screened for eligibility, 80 were deemed relevant for full publication review. Thirteen publications were included in the qualitative synthesis and assessed for systematic bias. Only five studies were included in the quantitative analysis because they showed a low risk of producing biased results in all the parameters. The forest plot indicated four studies that discuss anthelmintic resistance (P{\textless}0.05), while only one study did not discuss anthelmintic resistance (P{\textless}0.05). The pooled estimate showed 0.59 (95\% Confidence intervals: 0.08, 0.47) times higher odds for studies that report anthelmintic resistance than for studies reporting efficacious anthelmintic treatment, with significant and substantially low heterogeneity (I2=25\%). Anthelmintic resistance to injectable macrocyclic lactones is a reality. There are need to improve methodological reporting in studies, which is a problem for investigations that involves systematic review and meta-analysis (SR-MA).},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Extracellular vesicles from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC-EVs) have shown promise in wound healing. Their use in diabetic wounds specifically, however, remains pre-clinical and their efficacy remains uncertain less clear. A systematic review of preclinical studies is needed to determine the efficacy of MSC-EVs in the treatment of diabetic wounds to accelerate the clinical translation of this cell-based therapy. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched (to June 23, 2020). All English-language, full-text, controlled interventional studies comparing MSC-EVs to placebo or a "no treatment" arm in animal models of diabetic wounds were included. Study outcomes, including wound closure (primary outcome), scar width, blood vessel number and density, and re-epithelialisation were pooled using a random effects meta-analysis. Risk of bias (ROB) was assessed using the SYRCLE tool for pre-clinical animal studies. RESULTS: A total of 313 unique records were identified from our search, with 10 full text articles satisfying inclusion criteria (n = 136 animals). The administration of MSC-EVs improved closure of diabetic wounds compared to controls with a large observed effect (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) 5.48, 95\% Confidence Interval (CI) 3.55-8.13). Healing was further enhanced using MSC-EVs enriched in non-coding RNAs or microRNAs compared to controls (SMD 9.89, 95\%CI 7.32-12.46). Other outcomes, such as blood vessel density and number, scar width, and re-epithelialisation were improved with the administration of MSC-EVs, with a large effect. ROB across studies was unclear. CONCLUSION: MSC-EVs, particularly following enrichment for specific RNAs, are a promising treatment for diabetic wounds in pre-clinical studies and translation to the clinical domain appears warranted.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mesenchymal stromal cell derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) have been implicated in the regulation of tumor growth. Studies remain preclinical with effects ranging from inhibition of tumor growth to cancer progression. A systematic review and meta-analysis is needed to clarify the effect of MSC-EVs on tumor growth to facilitate potential translation to clinical trials. METHODS: A systematic search of the literature (MEDLINE, Embase, and BIOSIS databases to June 1, 2019) identified all pre-clinical controlled studies investigating the effect of MSC-EVs on tumor growth. Study selection and data extraction were performed in duplicate. Potential risk of bias was assessed using the SYRCLE tool. A random effects meta-analysis of reduction in tumor weight/volume (primary outcome) was performed. RESULTS: We identified 29 articles and 22 reported data on tumor responses that were included for meta-analysis. Studies were associated with unclear risk of bias in a large proportion of domains in accordance with the SYRCLE tool for determining risk of bias in preclinical studies. A high risk of bias was not identified in any study. MSC-EVs had a mixed response on tumor progression with some studies reporting inhibition of tumor growth and others reporting tumor progression. Overall, MSC-EVs exerted a non-significant reduction in tumor growth compared to controls (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.80, 95 \% CI -1.64 to 0.03, p = 0.06, I(2) = 87 \%). Some studies reported increased tumor growth which aligned with their stated hypothesis and some interrogated mechanisms in cancer biology. EVs isolated from MSCs that overexpressed anti-tumor RNAs were associated with significant tumor reduction in meta-analysis (SMD - 2.40, 95 \% CI -3.36 to -1.44, p {\textless} 0.001). Heterogeneity between studies was observed and included aspects of study design such as enrichment of MSC-EVs with specific anti-tumor molecules, tissue source of MSCs, method of EV isolation, characterization of MSCs and EVs, dosage and administration schedules, and tissue type and source of tumor cells studied. CONCLUSIONS: MSC-EVs are associated with mixed effects on tumor growth in animal models of cancer. In studies where anti-tumor RNAs are packaged in EVs, a significant reduction in tumor growth was observed. Reducing heterogeneity in study design may accelerate our understanding of the potential effects of MSC-EVs on cancer.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surgical specialists in plastic, head and neck, hand, trauma surgery, and emergency medicine physicians bear the burden of treating the most serious injuries caused by animals. Most of these incidents result from an attack by a known dog, and breed has been proposed, but not proven, to be a controllable factor. The authors summarize the peer-reviewed literature on dog bites in the United States, specifically as related to the breeds implicated. METHODS: A systematic review of all peer-reviewed publications reporting on dog bites in the United States was performed. MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library searches were conducted through May 8, 2018, for studies from the United States implicating a specific dog breed as responsible. RESULTS: Forty-one articles met inclusion criteria, the majority of which were single-institution retrospective reviews. Main outcomes were any dog bite reported in the peer-reviewed literature where a specific breed was implicated. Secondary measures included dog bites reported in areas where breed-specific legislation was enacted. The most common pure breed identified was German Shepherd, followed by Pit Bull-type breeds (i.e., American Staffordshire Terrier, American Pit Bull Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, American Bully), Labrador, Collie, and Rottweiler, respectively. Pit bull-type and German Shepherd breeds are consistently implicated for causing the most serious injuries to patients in the United States across heterogeneous populations, and this remained consistent across multiple decades. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' results indicate that German Shepherd and Pit Bull-type breeds account for the largest subset of pure breeds implicated in severe dog bites inflicted on humans in the medical literature. The role and complexity of mentioning breed in relation to human injuries are also discussed.},

	abstract = {The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) both recognize the importance of veterinary services in controlling zoonotic diseases, in preventing human injury, and in protecting the welfare of non-human animals. Furthermore, both organizations recommend regular evaluations of veterinary programs. Accordingly, we conducted a scoping review to collate the available peer-reviewed evaluations of subsidized small animal veterinary services in terms of the effects on animal and public health. We summarized the evaluation methods used, identified key journals in this disparate literature, and identified gaps in knowledge. CAB Abstracts, PubMed, and Scopus were searched, yielding 1441 records published between 2009 and 2016 for initial screening. After examining titles and keywords, abstracts, and finally full articles, we identified 32 relevant papers that evaluated 27 distinct programs. The global distribution was broad, with half of the papers evaluating programs in Africa or Asia, all of which were rabies vaccination programs targeting dogs. Three program evaluation categories were identified: zoonotic disease prevention (9 papers), animal welfare and control (9 papers), and One Health promotion (14 papers). Nearly three-quarters (72\%) of the papers used more than one method for collecting data. The most common data sources were questionnaires (22 papers) and administrative records, such as medical charts (21 papers). The most common indicators used for animal health-related program assessments were the number of animals reached by the program (27 papers) and any changes in animal population demographics (22 papers). These indicators were found in all three types of program evaluations (i.e., zoonotic disease prevention, animal welfare/control, and One Health promotion). For public health-related program assessments, the most common indicators consisted of determining barriers to a veterinary program's success (13 papers), followed by costs of a program (11 papers), changes in perceived threats or nuisances (11 papers), and community knowledge of a zoonotic disease (11 papers). The small number of papers identified in this review, n=32, underscores that comprehensive evaluations of subsidized veterinary services are uncommon in the peer-reviewed literature. Yet, when performed, such evaluations can help guide program delivery and future research. Given the high stakes and the high costs of subsidized veterinary services, greater efforts in program evaluation are warranted.},

Recent research has demonstrated the potential of natural products, such as polyphenol-rich fruit extracts, for use in the treatment of obesity. The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the metabolic effects of polyphenol-rich fruit extracts on diet-induced obesity (DIO) in rodents. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases to identify preclinical studies that assessed polyphenol-rich fruit extracts compared to placebo on DIO in rodents in December 2018. Two researchers selected the studies, extracted the data, and assessed the quality of studies. Meta-analyses of standardized mean difference (SMD) of outcomes were calculated in Stata 11, and causes of heterogeneity were assessed by meta-regression. RESULTS: We included 14 studies in the systematic review and 13 studies with 21 matched groups in the metaanalysis. Polyphenol-rich fruit extracts reduced the total body weight gain (SMD = -1.48; confidence interval: - 1.95, -1.01), energy intake (SMD = -0.42; -0.67, -0.17), visceral adipose tissue (SMD = -0.96; -1.25, -0.66), triglycerides (SMD = -1.00; -1.39, -0.62), cholesterol (SMD = -1.18, -1.66, -0.69), LDL- c (SMD = -1.15; -1.65, - 0.65), fasting glucose (SMD = -1.05; -1.65, -0.46), and fasting insulin (SMD = -1.40; -1.80, -1.00) when compared to vehicle.

This semi-systematic review synthesizes the evidence published in the last 30 years, worldwide, to address two main questions "what do farmers think (farmer's general view) about farm animal welfare?" and "what are the factors that influence their thinking?". A thematic analysis was conducted to identify factors that influenced the implementation of FAW innovation. The main outcomes extracted from 96 peer-reviewed publications on a range of livestock species identified 11 internal factors including farmer knowledge, empathy, personality, values, and human-animal bond; 15 external factors including economic advantages, communication, time and labor influenced the perception of FAW. Farmers' knowledge and cost implications of FAW were the most frequently reported factors. The review further highlights the need for promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and stakeholder participation. This study suggests strategies to improve FAW, including tools to support behavioral changes amongst farmers.},

We aimed to conduct the systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the epidemiological data on prevalence of Cryptococcus species complexes in trees and their surroundings, bird guano and secretions, animals, and highlight the reported episodes of cryptococcosis in Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve databases, including PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Proquest, Google Scholar, Embase, and the ISI Web of Science, as well as the national databases, from January 1969 to October 2019 were searched. Furthermore, gray literature (e.g., thesis, congress abstracts) was evaluated using Iran Doc and www.thesis. RESEARCH: ac.ir. Search process was accomplished on English or Persian language articles using the following keywords: "Cryptococcus", "Cryptococcosis", "invasive fungal infection", "Humans", "Birds", "Pigeon", "Animals", "Tree", "Eucalyptus", and "Iran", both alone and in combination. RESULTS: Overall 36 studies were eligible regarding Cryptococcus and cryptococcosis in Iran. The total prevalence rates of Cryptococcus species in the tree was 4.7\% (95\% CI: 2.3-7.8), and in bird guano was 20.4\% (95\% CI: 10.7-32.2). Cryptococcosis in animal, and human were 1.7\% (95\% CI: 0.01-5.1), and 2.8\% (95\% CI: 0.7v6.1), respectively. The highest prevalence of Cryptococcus in the trees (14.6\%), and bird guano (89.4\%) in Khorasan, animals (8.9\%) in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, and human (4.4\%) in Mazandaran provinces were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Given the significant risk of Cryptococcus species for susceptible humans, mainly HIV-infected patients, it seems quite necessary to adopt concrete preventive strategies to pinpoint the environmental habitats of this yeast.},

The research was done in the Thermal Comfort Laboratory at FEAGRI- UNICAMP, and the concept of the systematic review was applied. The research criterion was initially defined (the keywords) aiming to identify and evaluate the variables that describe the experimental characteristics and the animals. The primary keywords identified were: broiler chicken from commercial strains, broiler production, rearing conditions, thermal environment, air quality, acoustic environment, light intensity, management, and heat stress. Those were the key words searched in the database of the online libraries. The selected articles were registered into an electronic spreadsheet with the title, the name of the authors, year of publication, language, the journal where it was published, the keyword, the period when the research was done, source/database, and the abstract. A total of 167 articles were selected, and only 34 were added to the review. The use of the systematic review of the literature allowed identifying the main variables that positively influence the broiler performance, such as the temperature near the thermal comfort, the use of roof lining, besides the use of adiabatic cooling and cast bricks in the laterals. The presence of positive ventilation, as well as the use of yellow curtains and constant lighting, has also influenced a better performance to broilers.},

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common; however, effective treatments of the secondary brain injury are scarce. Melatonin is a potent, nonselective neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory agent that is showing promising results in neonatal brain injury. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the pre-clinical and clinical literature on the effectiveness of melatonin in improving outcome after TBI. Using the systematic review protocol for animal intervention studies (SYRCLE) and Cochrane methodology for clinical studies, a search of English-language articles was performed. Eligible studies were identified and data were extracted. Quality assessment was performed using the SYRCLE risk of bias tool. Meta-analyses were performed using standardized mean differences (SMD). Seventeen studies (15 pre-clinical, 2 clinical) met inclusion criteria. There was heterogeneity in the studies, and all had moderate-to-low risk of bias. Meta-analysis of pre-clinical data revealed an overall positive effect on neurobehavioural outcome with SMD of 1.51 (95\% CI: 1.06-1.96). Melatonin treatment had a favorable effect on neurological status, by an SMD of 1.35 (95\% CI: 0.83-1.88), and on cognition by an SMD of 1.16 (95\% CI: 0.4-1.92). Melatonin decreased the size of the contusion by an SMD of 2.22 (95\% CI: 0.8--3.59) and of cerebral edema by an SMD of 1.91 (95\% CI: 1.08-2.74). Only two clinical studies were identified. They were of low quality, were used for symptom management, and were of uncertain significance. In conclusion, there is evidence that melatonin treatment after TBI significantly improves both behavioral outcomes and pathological outcomes; however, significant research gaps exist, especially in clinical populations.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Neoangiogenesis is one of the key pathogenetic mechanisms in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Modulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) seems to be a possible adjuvant therapy for HCC, due to the anti-angiogenic and anti-fibrogenic activity of these drugs. AIM: To elucidate the role of ARBs and ACE-Is in HCC. METHODS: We performed an electronic search of the literature using the most accessed online databases (PubMed, Cochrane library, Scopus and Web of Science), entering the query terms "angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors" OR "ACE inhibitors" OR "ACE-I" AND "hepatocarcinoma*" OR "hepatocellular carcinoma; moreover "angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers" OR "ARBs" AND "hepatocarcinoma*" OR "hepatocellular carcinoma". Eligibility criteria were: (1) prospective or retrospective clinical studies; (2) epidemiological studies; and (3) experimental studies conducted in vivo or in vitro. Abstracts, conference papers, and reviews were excluded a priori. We limited our literature search to articles published in English, in peer-reviewed journals. RESULTS: Thirty-one studies were selected. Three interventional studies showed that ACE-Is had a significant protective effect on HCC recurrence only when used in combination with vitamin K or branched chain aminoacids, without a significant increase in overall survival. Of six retrospective observational studies, mainly focused on overall survival, only one demonstrated a prolonged survival in the ACE-Is group, whereas the two that also evaluated tumor recurrence showed conflicting results. All experimental studies displayed beneficial effects of RAS inhibitors on hepatocarcinogenesis. Numerous experimental studies, conducted either on animals and cell cultures, demonstrated the anti-angiogenetic and antifibrotic effect of ACE-Is and ARBs, thanks to the suppression of some cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1a, transforming growth factor-beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha. All or parts of these mechanisms were demonstrated in rodents developing fewer HCC and preneoplastic lesions after receiving such drugs. CONCLUSION: In humans, RAS inhibitors - alone or in combination - significantly suppressed the cumulative HCC recurrence, without prolonging patient survival, but some limitations intrinsic to these studies prompt further investigations.},

	abstract = {The global expansion of aquaculture has raised concerns about its environmental impacts, including effects on wildlife. Aquaculture farms are thought to repel some species and function as either attractive population sinks ('ecological traps') or population sources for others. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of empirical studies documenting interactions between aquaculture operations and vertebrate wildlife. Farms were associated with elevated local abundance and diversity of wildlife, although this overall effect was strongly driven by aggregations of wild fish at sea cages and shellfish farms (abundance: 72x; species richness: 2.0x). Birds were also more diverse at farms (1.1x), but other taxa showed variable and comparatively small effects. Larger effects were reported when researchers selected featureless or unstructured habitats as reference sites. Evidence for aggregation 'hotspots' is clear in some systems, but we cannot determine whether farms act as ecological traps for most taxa, as few studies assess either habitat preference or fitness in wildlife. Fish collected near farms were larger and heavier with no change in body condition, but also faced higher risk of disease and parasitism. Birds and mammals were frequently reported preying on stock, but little data exist on the outcomes of such interactions for birds and mammals - farms are likely to function as ecological traps for many species. We recommend researchers measure survival and reproduction in farm-associated wildlife to make direct, causal links between aquaculture and its effects on wildlife populations.},

	doi = {10.1002/syn.22103},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: Environmental enrichment (EE) can be related to changes in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus of adult rodents. Exposure to EE may also induce neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG). The aim of this systematic review was to analyze the current literature on the correlation between neurogenesis and BDNF expression in the hippocampal DG region resulting from exposure to EE, which is associated with changes in memory, in rodents. METHODS: Bibliographic searches of the Medline/PubMed and ScienceDirect databases were carried out, and 334 studies were found. A predefined protocol was used and registered on PROSPERO, and 32 studies were included for qualitative synthesis. The PRISMA was used to report this systematic review. RESULTS: Most of the included studies showed that there is little evidence in the literature demonstrating that memory changes resulting from EE are dependent on BDNF expression and that there is an induction of neurogenesis in the hippocampal DG. However, the observed increase in molecular expression levels and cell proliferation is dependent on the age, the timing and duration of exposure to EE. Regarding the methodological quality of the studies, the majority presented a risk of bias due to the high variability in the age of the animals. CONCLUSION: There are few studies in the literature that correlate the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in neurogenesis in the hippocampal DG with BDNF expression in this region in rodents exposed to EE; however, there are other factors that can modulate this neurogenesis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Strongyloides stercoralis infection, a neglected tropical disease, is widely distributed. Autochthonous cases have been described in Spain, probably infected long time ago. In recent years the number of diagnosed cases has increased due to the growing number of immigrants, travelers and refugees, but endemically acquired cases in Spain remains undetermined. METHODOLOGY: We systematically searched the literature for references on endemic strongyloidiasis cases in Spain. The articles were required to describe Strongyloides stercoralis infection in at least one Spanish-born person without a history of travel to endemic areas and be published before 31st May 2018. Epidemiological data from patients was collected and described individually as well as risk factors to acquisition of the infection, diagnostic technique that lead to the diagnosis, presence of eosinophilia and clinical symptoms at diagnosis. FINDINGS: Thirty-six studies were included, describing a total of 1083 patients with an average age of 68.3 years diagnosed with endemic strongyloidiasis in Spain. The vast majority of the cases were described in the province of Valencia (n = 1049). Two hundred and eight of the 251 (82.9\%) patients in whom gender was reported were male, and most of them had current or past dedication to agriculture. Seventy percent had some kind of comorbidity. A decreasing trend in the diagnosed cases per year is observed from the end of last decade. However, there are still nefigw diagnoses of autochthonous cases of strongyloidiasis in Spain every year. CONCLUSIONS: With the data provided by this review it is likely that in Spain strongyloidiasis might have been underestimated. It is highly probable that the infection remains undiagnosed in many cases due to low clinical suspicion among Spanish population without recent travel history in which the contagion probably took place decades ago.},

	abstract = {Long-term wildlife disease research (LTWDR) and its interfaces with humans and domestic animals provide perspective to understand the diseases' main drivers and how they operate. In a systematic review, we analysed the temporal trend of the studies on LTWDR, their aims, and the hosts, pathogens and geographic areas studied. We also evaluated the added value that such studies provide. For analysis, we selected a total of 538 articles from 1993 to 2017 with a study period greater than or equal to 4 consecutive years. A marked increase in the number of studies published during the last 20 years was observed that reflects a growing awareness of the outstanding role of wildlife as a reservoir of diseases. The most studied pathogen agents were viruses (39.2\%), bacteria (38.5\%) and protozoans (15.8\%). Concerning the hosts, mammals (84.9\%), particularly ungulates (40\%) and carnivores (30.9\%), and birds (12.5\%) were the most represented in these long-term studies. Most articles reached conclusions concerning the effect of the disease on the infection/host dynamics (98.7\%) and over 40\% considered the economic consequences or proposed management and control measures. The research was mainly located in the Northern Hemisphere. While the definition of LTWDR is not only determined by the duration of the monitoring, the study must be long enough to: (a) address ecological and epidemiological questions that cannot be resolved with short-term observations or experiments, and (b) clarify the effects of different drivers. This review demonstrates that LTWDR has provided information about the causes and consequences of disease change that otherwise could not have been obtained. It may be used to inform decisions related to the emergence of disease and might help to design early warning systems of disease based on retrospective investigations.},

	abstract = {Dairy product consumption may decrease colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, but very few studies have evaluated the association between different types of dairy products and CRC location. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the associations between dairy product consumption and CRC incidence. Summary RRs and ORs with 95\% CIs were estimated. A total of 15 cohort studies and 14 case-control studies comprising a total of {\textgreater}22,000 cases were included in the quantitative synthesis. The cohort studies showed a consistent significant decrease in CRC risk associated with higher consumption of total dairy products (RR: 0.80; 95\% CI: 0.70, 0.91) and total milk (RR: 0.82; 95\% CI: 0.76, 0.88) compared with the CRC risk associated with lower consumption. These studies also showed a significant protective association between low-fat milk consumption and CRC (RR: 0.76; 95\% CI: 0.66, 0.88), but only for colon cancer (RR: 0.73; 95\% CI: 0.61, 0.87). Cheese consumption was inversely associated with the risk of CRC (RR: 0.85; 95\% CI: 0.76, 0.96) and proximal colon cancer (RR: 0.74; 95\% CI: 0.60, 0.91). No significant associations with CRC were found for the consumption of low-fat dairy products, whole milk, fermented dairy products, or cultured milk. Most of these associations were not supported by the case-control studies. In conclusion, high consumption of total dairy products and total milk was associated with a lower risk of developing CRC at any anatomic location, including the proximal and distal colon and the rectum. Low-fat milk consumption was associated with a lower risk of CRC, but this association was restricted to colon cancer. Cheese consumption was associated with the prevention of CRC, specifically proximal colon cancer. Further studies on larger samples and with longer follow-up periods, along with appropriately designed and executed clinical trials, are warranted to determine whether dairy product consumption affects CRC development.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rhinovirus (RV) infections are the most common cause of viral upper respiratory infections (URIs), and in the majority of persons they are self-limiting. However, in others, viral URIs can progress to bacterial sinusitis and induce chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) exacerbations. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) review through April 2018 based on MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science-Science Citation Index (SCI), and Conference Proceedings Citation Index- Science (CPCI-S) using keywords: RV, respiratory virus, sinusitis, and airway epithelial cells. The goal of this systematic review was to: (1) determine the prevalence between RV and CRS, (2) study the changes that occur after experimental RV inoculation, (3) investigate the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which RV induces sinonasal inflammation, and (4) explore the treatment options available for RV-associated sinusitis. Data regarding study design, research question, intervention, subjects, outcomes, and biases was extracted. RESULTS: The initial search yielded 2395 unique abstracts, of which 614 were selected for full-text review; 147 were included in the final review. We determined that (1) the prevalence of RV infections is increased in those with CRS, (2) humans challenged in vivo with RV secrete local inflammatory mediators with radiographic mucosal thickening, (3) RV species RV-A and RV-C challenges in vitro to sinonasal epithelia produce robust cytokine responses and differential gene changes, and (4) no current therapies have produced consistent and significant resolution of disease. CONCLUSION: RV infections are common in persons with CRS, and incite inflammatory reactions that may result in CRS exacerbations and progression of disease. Further studies assessing RV species, and the host-virome response are required to develop new strategies targeting RV-induced CRS.},

	abstract = {Although East Africa is home to one of the most advanced dairy industries in Sub-Saharan Africa, regional annual milk production is insufficient to meet the demand. The challenge of increasing milk yields (MYs) among smallholder dairy cattle farmers (SDCFs) has received considerable attention and resulted in the introduction of various dairy management strategies (DMSs). Despite adoption of these DMSs, MYs remain low on-farm and there is a large discrepancy in the efficacy of DMSs across different farms. Therefore, the present study sought to: (1) identify on-farm DMSs employed by East African SDCFs to increase MYs and (2) summarize existing literature to quantify the expected MY changes associated with these identified DMSs. Data were collected through a comprehensive literature review and in-depth semi-structured interviews with 10 experts from the East African dairy sector. Meta-analysis of the literature review data was performed by deriving four multivariate regression models (i.e. models 1 to 4) that related DMSs to expected MYs. Each model differed in the weighting strategy used (e.g. number of observations and inverse of the standard errors) and the preferred model was selected based on the root estimated error variance and concordance correlation coefficient. Nine DMSs were identified, of which only adoption of improved cattle breeds and improved feeding (i.e. increasing diet quality and quantity) consistently and significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) increased daily MYs across the available studies. Improved breeds alongside adequate feeding explained ≤50\% of the daily MYs observed in the metadata while improved feeding explained ≤30\% of the daily MYs observed across the different models. Conversely, calf suckling significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) reduced MYs according to model 2. Other variables including days in milk, trial length and maximum ambient temperature (used as a proxy for heat stress) contributed significantly to decreasing MYs. These variables may explain some of the heterogeneity in MY responses to DMSs reported in the literature. Our results suggest that using improved cattle breeds alongside improved feeding is the most reliable strategy to increase MYs on-farm in East Africa. Nevertheless, these DMSs should not be considered as standalone solutions but as a pool of options that should be combined depending on the resources available to the farmer to achieve a balance between using dairy cattle genetics, proper husbandry and feeding to secure higher MYs.},

	abstract = {Glyphosate (GLY) is an herbicide widely used in agriculture. First considered as non-toxic or slightly toxic to bees, GLY and its different formulations have shown, more recently, to affect negatively the survival, development and behavior of these insects, even when used in doses and concentrations recommended by the manufacturer. Thus, the results of research on the toxicity of GLY to bees are often conflicting, which makes a meta-analysis interesting for data integration, generating a statistically reliable result. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the GLY effects on mortality of bees through a meta-analysis. For this, a search was carried out in the databases Web of Science, CAPES (Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - Brazil), Scopus, and PubMed. Papers that evaluated the effect of GLY on bee mortality published between 1945 and October 2020, were considered. After obtaining the data, R software was used to perform the meta-analytical tests. Sixteen papers on mortality were selected with 34 data sets. Most of the sets demonstrated differences between the control and experimental groups, showing that the treatments with GLY caused higher mortality of bees. The results considering the methodology used (ingestion or contact), the phase of the biological cycle (adults or larvae), and the dose (ecologically relevant dose and recommended by the manufacturer) were different when compared with their respective control groups. Therefore, GLY can be considered toxic to bees. It is important to emphasize that this meta-analysis identified that papers assessing the toxicity of GLY to bees are still scarce, for both lethal and sublethal effects, mainly for stingless and solitary bee species.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Folate is an essential nutrient required for many different functions in the body. It is particularly important for DNA synthesis, immune functions, and during pregnancy. Folate supplements are commonly prescribed by health professionals for a number of different conditions, however, the absorption of the different derivatives remains unclear. The aim of this review was to assess the bioavailability of various forms of folate supplements in healthy populations and animal models. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted of original research, which assessed the bioavailability of different oral forms of folate in healthy adults or animal models. The following databases were searched: PubMed (U.S. National Library of Medicine), ProQuest Medical Collection (ProQuest) and ScienceDirect (Elsevier) up to March 30, 2017. The inclusion criteria consisted of both animal and human research, no disease state or condition, and assessed levels after an intervention of a folate derivative. RESULTS: A total of 23 studies out of 5226 met the full inclusion criteria. Of these, 4 were animal studies and 19 were human studies. There was variation in supplement forms used with the most commonly tested being folic acid followed by 5-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF). Dosages ranged from 25 μg up to 200 mg. Only three studies found a statistically significant difference in folate bioavailability when evaluating different supplement forms. These studies found 5-MTHF to be more effective at increasing folate levels in participants. CONCLUSIONS: This review has found a number of methodological limitations and conflicting results. Only three out of the 23 studies assessed found a statistically significant difference between different supplemental forms of folate. Quality absorption studies assessing the bioavailability of oral folate supplements are crucial if clinicians are to make effective evidence-based recommendations. More research is required for greater clarification regarding the bioavailability of these supplements.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Climate change affects livestock production and productivity, which could threaten livestock-based food security in pastoral and agro-pastoral production systems of the tropics and sub-tropics. Boran cattle breed is one of the hardiest Zebu cattle reared by Borana Oromo pastoralists for milk and meat production. However, there is limited comprensive information on production, reproduction and adaption traits of the Boran cattle in Ethiopia. Thus, this paper aims to compile the main production, reproduction and some adaptation traits of Boran cattle based on systematic review and meta-analysis of peer reviewed published and unpublished literature. METHODOLOGY: A combination of systematic review and meta-analysis based on PRISMA guideline was employed. Accordingly, out of 646 recorded articles identified through database searching, 64 were found to be eligible for production, reproduction and adaptation characteristics of the Boran cattle, 28 articles were included in qualitative systematic review while 36 articles were used for quantitative meta-analysis. RESULT: The Boran cattle breed has the ability to survive, produce and reproduce under high ambient temperature, utilize low quality forage resources, and resist water shortage or long watering intervals and tick infestations. The review revealed that the breed employs various adaptation responses (morphological, physiological, biochemical, metabolic, cellular and molecular responses) to cope with harsh environmental conditions including climate change, rangeland degradation, seasonal feed and water shortages and high incidences of tick infestations. The meta-analysis using a random-effects model allowed provision of pooled estimates of heritability and genetic correlations for reproduction and production traits, which could be used to solve genetic prediction equations under a population level in purebred Boran cattle. In addition, heritability and genetic-correlation estimates found in the present study suggest that there is high genetic variability for most traits in Boran cattle, and that genetic progress is possible for all studied traits in this breed. CONCLUSION: The Boran cattle breed has the ability to survive, produce and reproduce under high ambient temperature, utilize low quality forage resources, and resist water shortage or long watering intervals and tick infestations. However, currently there are several challenges such as recurrent droughts, pasture deterioration and lack of systematic selection and breeding programs that play to undermine the realization of the potential of the breed. Thus, we recommend systematic selection for enhancing the reproductive and production performances without compromising the adaptation traits of the breed coupled with improved management of rangelands.},

The aim of this review was to assess the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of these drugs in dogs and cats. Through a systematic review of the literature, we identified 37 articles on the use of misoprostol, sucralfate and other gastroprotectants in dogs and cats. There was evidence to support use of misoprostol in the prevention of aspirin-induced gastroduodenal mucosal injury in dogs, and for use of sucralfate in the prevention of acid-induced oesophagitis in cats. However, the overall quality of evidence supporting the use of these drugs in small animal patients was poor. In contrast, there was evidence of important adverse effects, especially drug interaction and gastro-intestinal signs. We therefore recommend prescribing these drugs with caution until further well-conducted studies reveal a useful gastroprotectant effect.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Amplifying endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms is a promising avenue for stroke therapy. One target is mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine kinase regulating cell proliferation, cell survival, protein synthesis, and autophagy. Animal studies investigating the effect of rapamycin on mTOR inhibition following cerebral ischemia have shown conflicting results. AIM: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the effectiveness of rapamycin in reducing infarct volume in animal models of ischemic stroke. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: Our search identified 328 publications. Seventeen publications met inclusion criteria (52 comparisons: 30 reported infarct size and 22 reported neurobehavioral score). Study quality was modest (median 4 of 9) with no evidence of publication bias. The point estimate for the effect of rapamycin was a 21.6\% (95\% CI, 7.6\%-35.7\% p {\textless} 0.01) improvement in infarct volume and 30.5\% (95\% CI 17.2\%-43.8\%, p {\textless} 0.0001) improvement in neuroscores. Effect sizes were greatest in studies using lower doses of rapamycin. CONCLUSION: Low-dose rapamycin treatment may be an effective therapeutic option for stroke. Modest study quality means there is a potential risk of bias. We recommend further high-quality preclinical studies on rapamycin in stroke before progressing to clinical trials.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Zoonotic diseases account for a substantial portion of infectious disease outbreaks and burden on public health programs to maintain surveillance and preventative measures. Taking advantage of new modeling approaches and data sources have become necessary in an interconnected global community. To facilitate data collection, analysis, and decision-making, the number of spatial decision support systems reported in the last 10 years has increased. This systematic review aims to describe characteristics of spatial decision support systems developed to assist public health officials in the management of zoonotic disease outbreaks. METHODS: A systematic search of the Google Scholar database was undertaken for published articles written between 2008 and 2018, with no language restriction. A manual search of titles and abstracts using Boolean logic and keyword search terms was undertaken using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extraction included items such as spatial database management, visualizations, and report generation. RESULTS: For this review we screened 34 full text articles. Design and reporting quality were assessed, resulting in a final set of 12 articles which were evaluated on proposed interventions and identifying characteristics were described. Multisource data integration, and user centered design were inconsistently applied, though indicated diverse utilization of modeling techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristics, data sources, development and modeling techniques implemented in the design of recent SDSS that target zoonotic disease outbreak were described. There are still many challenges to address during the design process to effectively utilize the value of emerging data sources and modeling methods. In the future, development should adhere to comparable standards for functionality and system development such as user input for system requirements, and flexible interfaces to visualize data that exist on different scales.

	abstract = {Concern from the public is growing regarding early cow-calf separation, yet proponents of this practice maintain that artificial rearing is critical for cow and calf health. Early separation is assumed to reduce the risk of transfer of pathogens from dam to neonatal calf, but a wide range of health benefits associated with extended cow-calf contact has also been documented. The aim of this systematic review was to report and synthesize conclusions from the literature on dairy cow and calf health in conventional rearing versus cow-calf contact systems. Peer-reviewed, published manuscripts, written in English, directly comparing dairy cow or calf health in artificial versus suckling systems, were eligible for inclusion. We conducted 7 targeted searches using Web of Science to identify key literature on important health conditions. The resulting manuscripts underwent a 4-step appraisal process, and further manuscripts were sourced from reference lists. This process resulted in a final sample of 70 articles that addressed cow and calf health. Sufficient literature was available to assess mastitis in cows, and scours, cryptosporidiosis, Johne's disease, pneumonia, immunity, and mortality in calves. The results for cryptosporidiosis, pneumonia, immunity, and mortality were mixed, with some differences between studies likely attributable to flawed comparisons between cohorts. Overall, the articles addressing calf scours and mastitis pointed to beneficial or no effects of suckling. The studies addressing Johne's disease did not find cow-calf contact to be a significant risk factor. In conclusion, the scientific peer-reviewed literature on cow and calf health provides no consistent evidence in support of early separation.},

	abstract = {The present study aimed to investigate the relationships between each step of the reproductive process (cyclicity, estrus, and fertility) and both milk production and body reserves management. The database included 102 studies and 300 treatments collected on electronic databases. Coding for each type of experimental factor enabled within and between experiment variation to be distinguished, and to select subsets of experiments with common objectives in order to avoid inappropriate aggregation of results across studies with very different objectives. Finally, the models were based on limited numbers of experiments (from 14 to 30 treatments originating from 7 to 15 distinct experiments) because (i) only data coded for diet and genetic factors were analyzed, separately (studies on other factors such as milking frequency and parity were too scarce); (ii) a minimum of variation of the explanatory variable was set to enable the quantification of the relationship; (iii) few studies reported comparable reproductive, production and body reserves traits. The results of the meta-analyses showed that the commencement of luteal activity (C-LA) was not associated with milk yield and that the relationship between C-LA and body condition score (BCS) at calving was quadratic (with an optimal BCS at calving around 3.10 on a 0-5 scale). Although the interval from calving to first observed estrus (COE1) is partly composed of C-LA, it was not associated with BCS. For each additional 1 kg of milk yield produced at both peak and over the initial 14 weeks of lactation, COE1 was delayed by 1.1 days. The conception rate to first insemination (CRAI1) was reduced by 2.0\% (of inseminated cows) and by 2.2\% for each additional 1 kg of milk yield at peak and at service respectively. Moreover, CRAI1 was increased by 38.2\% and 22.0\% for each additional 1 score of BCS at service and at nadir (i.e. lowest BCS) respectively. Finally, risk of pregnancy (PR) was not associated with milk yield. However, PR was increased by 42.8\% (of cows) and 16.8\% for each additional unit of BCS at calving and at nadir, respectively. This meta-analysis showed that postpartum cyclicity of dairy cows was mainly associated with BCS at calving, whereas estrus expression was mainly associated with milk yield and fertility with both BCS and milk yield. Genetic and nutritional strategies that target a BCS of 3.10 and limit both BCS loss and peak milk yield could be an effective way to improve reproduction.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pntd.0007791},
	abstract = {Monkeypox is a vesicular-pustular illness that carries a secondary attack rate in the order of 10\% in contacts unvaccinated against smallpox. Case fatality rates range from 1 to 11\%, but scarring and other sequelae are common in survivors. It continues to cause outbreaks in remote populations in Central and West Africa, in areas with poor access and weakened or disrupted surveillance capacity and information networks. Recent outbreaks in Nigeria (2017-18) and Cameroon (2018) have occurred where monkeypox has not been reported for over 20 years. This has prompted concerns over whether there have been changes in the biology and epidemiology of the disease that may in turn have implications for how outbreaks and cases should best be managed. A systematic review was carried out to examine reported data on human monkeypox outbreaks over time, and to identify if and how epidemiology has changed. Published and grey literature were critically analysed, and data extracted to inform recommendations on outbreak response, use of case definitions and public health advice. The level of detail, validity of data, geographical coverage and consistency of reporting varied considerably across the 71 monkeypox outbreak documents obtained. An increase in cases reported over time was supported by literature from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Data were insufficient to measure trends in secondary attack rates and case fatality rates. Phylogenetic analyses consistently identify two strains of the virus without evidence of emergence of a new strain. Understanding of monkeypox virulence with regard to clinical presentation by strain is minimal, with infrequent sample collection and laboratory analysis. A variety of clinical and surveillance case definitions are described in the literature: two definitions have been formally evaluated and showed high sensitivity but low specificity. These were specific to a Congo-Basin (CB) strain-affected area of the DRC where they were used. Evidence on use of antibiotics for prophylaxis against secondary cutaneous infection is anecdotal and limited. Current evidence suggests there has been an increase in total monkeypox cases reported by year in the DRC irrespective of advancements in the national Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) system. There has been a marked increase in number of individual monkeypox outbreak reports, from outside the DRC in between 2010 and 2018, particularly in the Central African Republic (CAR) although this does not necessarily indicate an increase in annual cases over time in these areas. The geographical pattern reported in the Nigeria outbreak suggests a possible new and widespread zoonotic reservoir requiring further investigation and research. With regards to outbreak response, increased attention is warranted for high-risk patient groups, and nosocomial transmission risks. The animal reservoir remains unknown and there is a dearth of literature informing case management and successful outbreak response strategies. Up-to-date complete, consistent and longer-term research is sorely needed to inform and guide evidence-based response and management of monkeypox outbreaks.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The optimal surgical technique for treatment of cranial cruciate ligament rupture in canine has been scientifically discussed for decades. Despite the continuous debate, proximal tibial osteotomies such as tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) and tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA) are increasingly common. The objective of this review was to systematically evaluate the literature reporting outcome and complications associated with TPLO and TTA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic search of literature databases identified articles published from August 2004 to February 2016 describing evaluations of short- or longterm outcomes as well as complications following TPLO or TTA. RESULTS: Ninety-one studies were included in this review and assigned to one out of four evidence levels. Of those, 89 studies provided the lowest evidence level and only two were assigned to the third-best evidence level. A comparison of subjective gait analyses could not detect differences in the decrease of lameness between TPLO and TTA, while objective gait analysis supports the superiority of TPLO. Fewer patients treated with TPLO were diagnosed with postoperative joint instability and TPLO had a lower percent increase of osteoarthritis (OA) after surgery. Owner satisfaction was high for both techniques. For TPLO and TTA the average total, minor, major and catastrophic complication rates were 15.9 \% and 20.8 \%, 7.9 \% and 11.6 \%, 5.2 \% and 13.2 \% as well as 0.8 \% and 5.6 \%, respectively. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The assessed literature supports the hypothesis that TPLO is associated with lower complication rates, an improved clinical-functional outcome and less increase of OA compared to TTA. The results are indicative for a long-term restoration of normal limb function after TPLO. However, the strength of available evidence and the comparability of each study's results were poor and more comparative studies are needed to draw strong conclusions towards the superiority of the TPLO over the TTA.},

	abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Maca - Lepidium meyenii Walp. has been cultivated and used by Andean people for over 1300-2000 years in Peru as food and medicine. Starting in the late 1990's it has developed into an important herbal medicine in China and is now cultivated there widely, too Aim of study: This study aims to provide an insight into the emergence of maca on the global market as an alternative remedy to treat reproductive health related problems in both men and women and to critically assess these health claims. Methodology: A search of electronic databases such as EMBASE and a hand-search was done to acquire peer-reviewed articles and reports about maca. Results and discussion: Lepidium meyenii is used traditionally as a tonic, fertility enhancer for both humans and cattle, and to treat a variety of ailments such as rheumatism, respiratory disorders and anaemia among others. Maca root is cooked, baked, fermented as a drink and made into porridge. In the last twenty years, maca was introduced onto the global market and demand has dramatically grown over this time with its promotion on the internet, as the 'Peruvian Ginseng' for libido and fertility enhancement. It has also been said to treat menopausal symptoms, erectile dysfunction and benign prostatic hyperplasia. The sky-rocketing demand for the plant has seen a shift from traditional cultivation methods to mass production practices with the use of fertilisers and also pesticides; as maca is now grown in areas other than the Andes such as in the Yunnan province in China. This can potentially affect the phytochemistry and composition of the plant and thus, the quality, safety and efficacy of maca products. Meanwhile, research into maca's medicinal properties has followed the spike in popularity of maca and has been focused mainly on maca's aphrodisiac and fertility enhancing properties. So far, the in vivo studies and clinical trials conducted have yielded inconclusive results. Some of the key limitations reside in methodology and sample size. Chemical profiling, led to the discovery of new compounds unique to maca, such as, 'macamides' and also other active metabolites like the glucosinolates; to which the medicinal effects of maca have been ascribed but cannot be confirmed due to lack of data. Conclusions: To date, the health claims of maca cannot be fully supported from a scientific standpoint and more research is needed. It appears that the indigenous local knowledge about the health benefits of maca has been dragged out of context to fit the demands of a growing market for herbal remedies. This globalisation (or hype esp. in China) also has had serious consequences for the local producers in Peru. The lack of protocols to regulate the production and marketing of maca during this rapid expansion, poses a threat to both the safety of consumers and the sustainability of supply.},

A total of 23 in vivo studies were identified in which Agolin was supplemented at 1 g/d per cow; then a meta-analysis was performed to determine the response ratio on milk yield, rumen fermentation, methane emissions and health. Results indicated that an adaptation period of at least 4 weeks of treatment is required. Whereas short-term studies showed minor and inconsistent effects of Agolin, long-term studies ({\textgreater}4 weeks of treatment) revealed that Agolin supplementation increases milk yield (+3.6\%), fat and protein corrected milk (+4.1\%) and feed efficiency (+4.4\%) without further changes in milk composition and feed intake. Long-term treatment also decreased methane production per day (-8.8\%), per dry matter intake (-12.9\%) and per fat and protein corrected milk yield (-9.9\%) without changes in rumen fermentation pattern. In conclusion, despite the mode of action is still unclear and the small number of studies considered, these findings show that Agolin represents an encouraging alternative to improve productivity in dairy cows.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Toxoplasmosis is a zoonotic disease causing severe symptoms in pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals. On average, worldwide, around 30\% of people are seropositive. The oral transmission route is of great significance and food, particularly meat, is an important transmission vehicle for T. gondii. However, the role of different food matrices is debated. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to assess the risk of humans developing acute T. gondii infection via the foodborne route. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Case-control studies including acute cases of T. gondii infection were included after literature searches, without time limits, in several databases. All studies estimating the risk of acquiring T. gondii infection after consumption of specific food categories were included. RESULTS: Three risk factors proved to be significantly associated with acute T. gondii infection in humans: consumption of raw/undercooked meat, Odds Ratio (OR) 3.44 (1.29-9.16), consumption of raw/undercooked beef, OR 2.22 (1.57-3.12), and consumption of raw/undercooked sheep meat, OR 3.85 (1.85-8.00). Consumption of raw/undercooked pork, raw eggs, and unpasteurized milk proved to be non-significant risk factors. LIMITATIONS: Limitations in the present review and meta-analysis are due to the low number of case-control studies available for analysis and the lack of a search strategy targeting gray literature. CONCLUSION: Consumption of raw/undercooked beef and sheep meat are important risk factors for T. gondii infection. Their consumption should be avoided in order to prevent toxoplasmosis, particularly by those in at-risk categories, including pregnant women.

We estimated the global case fatality rate (CFR) of CCHFV infections and the prevalence of CCHFV in humans, ticks and other animal species. We also explored the socio-demographic and clinical factors that influence these parameters. In this systematic review with meta-analyses we searched publications from database inception to 03rd February 2020 in Pubmed, Scopus, and Global Index Medicus. Studies included in this review provided cross-sectional data on the CFR and/or prevalence of one or more targets used for the detection of CCHFV. Two independent investigators selected studies to be included. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted independently by all authors. Data collected were analysed using a random effect meta-analysis. In all, 2345 records were found and a total of 312 articles (802 prevalence and/or CFR data) that met the inclusion criteria were retained. The overall CFR was 11.7\% (95\% CI = 9.1-14.5), 8.0\% (95\% CI = 1.0-18.9), and 4.7\% (95\% CI = 0.0-37.6) in humans with acute, recent, and past CCHFV infections respectively. The overall CCHFV acute infections prevalence was 22.5\% (95\% CI = 15.7-30.1) in humans, 2.1\% (95\% CI = 1.3-2.9) in ticks, and 4.5\% (95\% CI = 1.9-7.9) in other animal species. The overall CCHFV recent infections seroprevalence was 11.6\% (95\% CI = 7.9-16.4) in humans and 0.4\% (95\% CI = 0.0-2.9) in other animal species. The overall CCHFV past infections seroprevalence was 4.3\% (95\% CI = 3.3-5.4) in humans and 12.0\% (95\% CI = 9.9-14.3) in other animal species. CFR was higher in low-income countries, countries in the WHO African, South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean regions, in adult and ambulatory patients. CCHFV detection rate in humans were higher in CCHFV suspected cases, healthcare workers, adult and hospitalized patients, ticks of the genus Ornithodoros and Amblyomma and in animals of the orders Perissodactyla and Bucerotiformes. This review highlights a significant disease burden due to CCHFV with a strong disparity according to country income levels, geographic regions, various human categories and tick and other animal species. Preventive measures in the light of these findings are expected.},

	abstract = {Ovariohysterectomy in female dogs is a frequent surgical procedure for sterilization. However, there might be short-term and long-term complications that are necessary to know. This systematic review aims to identify complications due to ovariohysterectomy in dogs, analyzing the methodological quality of the studies that provide data. 40 studies published in Spanish, English, and Portuguese were identified through an electronic search in Pub Med, Medwell Journals, Scielo, Science Direct, and Google Academic. Six descriptive studies of complications due to canine ovariohysterectomy were selected. Studies on complications with non-comparable methodologies were excluded. Heterogeneity was observed in the characteristics and quality of the studies. The majority used convenience sampling, in which the number of participants varied between 72 and 1880. The analysis units were purebred and crossbred canine females from 6 to 108 months of age. The follow-up period of patients for the assessment of complications varied from one week to ten years. The proportion of complications ranged from 0.1 to 74\%. The main events reported are those that occur in short term periods, such as anesthetic complications, bleeding, and wound inflammation. In the long term, there is urinary incontinence, pyometra, and obesity. It is concluded that the scientific evidence available on complications in dogs sterilized by ovariohysterectomy is not enough to support decision-making in the clinical practice with respect to the topic addressed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Given the limitations of current therapies for the reconstruction of bone defects, regenerative medicine has arisen as a new therapeutic strategy along with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which, because of their osteogenic potential and immunomodulatory properties, have emerged as a promising alternative for the treatment of bone injuries. In vivo studies have demonstrated that MSCs have a positive effect on regeneration due to their secretion of cytokines and growth factors that, when collected in conditioned medium (MSC-CM) and applied to an injured tissue, can modulate and promote the formation of new tissue. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of application of conditioned medium derived from mesenchymal stem cells in bone regeneration in animal and human models. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review with a comprehensive search through February of 2018 using several electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CENTRAL (Ovid), and LILACS), and we also used the "snowballing technique". Articles that met the inclusion criteria were selected through abstract review and subsequent assessment of the full text. We assessed the risk of bias with the SYRCLE and Cochrane tools, and three meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: We included 21 articles, 19 of which used animal models and 2 of which used human models. In animal models, the application of MSC-CM significantly increased the regeneration of bone defects in comparison with control groups. Human studies reported early mineralization in regenerated bones, and no bone resorption, inflammation, nor local or systemic alterations were observed in any case. The meta-analysis showed an overall favorable effect of the application of MSC-CM. CONCLUSIONS: The application of MSC-CM to bone defects has a positive and favorable effect on the repair and regeneration of bone tissue, particularly in animal models. It is necessary to perform additional studies to support the application of MSC-CM in clinical practice.},

The prevention of tick-borne diseases is strictly linked to the successful management of tick vector populations. The employ of repellents can represent a worth solution to avoid tick bites. It is widely adopted to protect travellers and pets exposed to ticks during limited periods of the year. The use of natural products as active ingredients in eco-friendly repellent formulations is currently a prominent research area, due to the wide diversity and high effectiveness of a number of plant-borne compounds, with special reference to essential oils (EOs) extracted from medicinal and aromatic species. Here, we reviewed current knowledge available on EOs tested as repellents against tick species of veterinary importance. Furthermore, we analysed the effectiveness of pure compounds isolated from EOs as tick repellents and their potential implications for practical use in the öreal world". A quantitative analysis of literature available is this research field was provided, along with its impact (i.e., in terms of citations over time) on the scientific community of researchers in tick control science and natural product chemistry. In the final sections, future outlooks are highlighted. We discussed major challenges to stabilize the most effective EOs and pure molecules, explore the synergistic and antagonistic effects in blends of EOs and/or pure constituents, standardize currently adopted testing methods, and evaluate non-target risks of herbal repellents.},

	abstract = {Fungal infections are one of the most prevalent diseases in the world and there is a lack of new antifungal drug development for these diseases. We conducted a systematic review of the literature regarding the in vitro antifungal activity of the organoselenium compounds ebselen (Eb) and diphenyl diselenide [(PhSe)2]. A systematic review was carried out based on the search for articles with data concerning Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values, indexed in international databases and published until August 2020. A total of 2337 articles were found, and, according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria used, 22 articles were included in the study. Inhibitory activity against 96\% (200/208) and 95\% (312/328) of the pathogenic fungi tested was described for Eb and [(PhSe)2], respectively. Including in these 536 fungal isolates tested, organoselenium activity was highlighted against Candida spp., Cryptococcus ssp., Trichosporon spp., Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp., Pythium spp., and Sporothrix spp., with MIC values lower than 64 μg/mL. In conclusion, Eb and [(PhSe)2] have a broad spectrum of in vitro inhibitory antifungal activity. These data added with other pharmacological properties of these organoselenium compounds suggest that both compounds are potential future antifungal drugs. Whether MICs toward the upper end of the ranges described here are compatible with efficacious therapy, and whether they may achieve such end as a result of the favorable non-antimicrobial effects of selenium on the host, requires more in vivo testing.
Fungal infections require the investigation of new drugs. The study is a systematic review of organo-selenium compounds with potential antifungal action. In 22 articles included in this review, in a total of 536 isolates of pathogenic fungi tested, the compounds showed action in more than 90\% of them.

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0201077},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-union affects up to 10\% of fractures and is associated with substantial morbidity. There is currently no single effective therapy for the treatment or prevention of non-union. Potential treatments are currently selected for clinical trials based on results from limited animal studies, with no attempt to compare results between therapies to determine which have the greatest potential to treat non-union. AIM: The aim of this systematic review was to define the range of therapies under investigation at the preclinical stage for the prevention or treatment of fracture non-union. Additionally, through meta-analysis, it aimed to identify the most promising therapies for progression to clinical investigation. METHODS: MEDLINE and Embase were searched from 1St January 2004 to 10th April 2017 for controlled trials evaluating an intervention to prevent or treat fracture non-union. Data regarding the model used, study intervention and outcome measures were extracted, and risk of bias assessed. RESULTS: Of 5,171 records identified, 197 papers describing 204 therapies were included. Of these, the majority were only evaluated once (179/204, 88\%), with chitosan tested most commonly (6/204, 3\%). Substantial variation existed in model design, length of survival and duration of treatment, with results poorly reported. These factors, as well as a lack of consistently used objective outcome measures, precluded meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the variability and poor methodological reporting of current non-union research. The authors call for a consensus on the standardisation of animal models investigating non-union, and suggest journals apply stringent criteria when considering animal work for publication.},

	abstract = {Meat eaters often have an ambivalent relationship with the common practice of killing animals for food. They enjoy the taste of meat but dislike the harming of animals that it entails. This moral conflict, often referred to as the 'meat paradox,' tends to result in cognitive dissonance that meat eaters need to resolve. One of the arguably most basic strategies to deal with this dissonance is to cognitively dissociate meat from its animal origins. Whereas philosophers for long time have theorized about the role of such dissociation for consumer behavior, researchers have only recently started to empirically investigate the phenomenon. Here, we present the first systematic literature review of research on consumers' tendency to dissociate meat from its animal origins. Twenty-one publications comprising eight qualitative, one mixed-methods, four correlational, and twenty experimental/interventional studies were identified, which all provided support for the central psychological role of dissociation for meat consumption. However, the review also revealed the need for further research on moderating variables such as gender, age and generation, dietary styles, and people's place of living, including cross-cultural differences. Strikingly, no study so far seems to have included behavioral outcomes, urging the need for future research on how dissociation might affect behavior.},

	abstract = {Some studies have reported that milk and dairy product consumption reduces bladder cancer incidence, whereas others have reported null or opposite findings. This meta-analysis of 26 cohort and case-control studies has been conducted to pool the risk of the association between milk and dairy products and bladder cancer. A systematic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Web of Science (from inception to 30 April 2018) was conducted. Random-effects models were used to compute pooled estimates of RR for high or medium compared with low consumption of milk and dairy. Sensitivity analyses were conducted. Subgroup analyses were performed based on type of dairy, gender, geographic location, and type of study design. Random-effects meta-regression was used to evaluate other confounding factors. Overall, medium compared with low consumption was associated with lower pooled risk of bladder cancer for total dairy products (RR = 0.90; 95\% CI: 0.81, 0.98), milk (RR = 0.90; 95\% CI: 0.82, 0.98), and fermented dairy products (RR = 0.87; 95\% CI: 0.79, 0.96). The inverse association for milk consumption was stronger in Asians (RR = 0.79; 95\% CI: 0.59, 0.98) and in cohort design studies (RR = 0.85; 95\% CI: 0.71, 0.99). Moreover, high compared with low consumption was significantly associated with a lower pooled risk for milk (RR = 0.89; 95\% CI: 0.81, 0.98) and fermented dairy products (RR = 0.78; 95\% CI: 0.61, 0.94). However, high compared with low consumption of whole milk was significantly associated with a higher risk (RR = 1.21; 95\% CI: 1.04, 1.38). The statistical heterogeneity was considerable. In conclusion, the present meta-analysis suggests a decreased risk of bladder cancer associated with medium consumption of total dairy products and with medium and high consumption of milk and fermented dairy products. An increased risk of bladder cancer was observed with high consumption of whole milk. Interpretations of the results should be made with caution.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: West African landscapes are largely characterised by complex agroforest mosaics. Although the West African forests are considered a nonhuman primate hotspot, knowledge on the distribution of many species is often lacking and out-of-date. Considering the fast-changing nature of the landscapes in this region, up-to-date information on primate occurrence is urgently needed, particularly of taxa such as colobines, which may be more sensitive to habitat modification than others. Understanding wildlife occurrence and mechanisms of persistence in these human-dominated landscapes is fundamental for developing effective conservation strategies. METHODS: In this paper, we aim to review current knowledge on the distribution of three threatened primates in Guinea-Bissau and neighbouring regions, highlighting research gaps and identifying priority research and conservation action. We conducted a systematic literature review of primate studies from 1976 to 2016 in Guinea-Bissau, southern Senegal and western Guinea (Boké Region). We mapped historical observation records of chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus), Temminck's red colobus (Pilicolobus badius temminckii) and king colobus (Colobus polykomos), including our preliminary survey data from Dulombi, a newly established National Park (NP) in Guinea-Bissau. RESULTS: We found 151 documents, including 87 journal articles, that contained field data on primates in this region. In Guinea-Bissau, nearly all studies focussed south of the Corubal River, including mainly Cantanhez, Cufada, and Boé NP's. In Senegal, most of the data came from Fongoli and Niokolo-Koba NP. In Boké (Guinea) studies are few, with the most recent data coming from Sangarédi. In Dulombi NP we recorded eight primate species, including chimpanzees, red colobus and king colobus. Across the selected region, chimpanzees, red colobus and king colobus were reported in eleven, twelve and seven protected areas, respectively. DISCUSSION: Our study demonstrates large geographical research gaps particularly for the two colobines. For the first time after more than two decades, we confirm the presence of red colobus and king colobus north of the Corubal River in Guinea-Bissau. The little information available from large parts of the red colobus range raises questions regarding levels of population fragmentation in this species, particularly in Casamance and across northern Guinea-Bissau. There are still no records demonstrating the occurrence of king colobus in Senegal, and the presence of a viable population in north-eastern Guinea-Bissau remains uncertain. While the occurrence of chimpanzees in Guinea-Bissau and Senegal is well documented, data from Boké (Guinea) are sparse and out-of-date. Our approach-the mapping of data gathered from a systematic literature review-allows us to provide recommendations for selecting future geographical survey locations and planning further research and conservation strategies in this region.},

	abstract = {One strategy for improving fertility in cattle is administration of GnRH or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) during the luteal phase, which increases progesterone (P4) secretion and delays luteolysis. To provide an overview of how GnRH or hCG treatment between 4 and 15 d after artificial insemination (AI) improves pregnancy per AI (P/AI) in cows, a meta-analysis was performed on 107 different trials from 52 publications. Data from 18,082 treated cows and 18,385 untreated controls were meta-analyzed. The meta-analysis explained the relative risk for P/AI with GnRH or hCG treatment under various circumstances. The results did not show any difference in P/AI between cows treated with hCG and cows treated with GnRH. Compared with no treatment, treatment with GnRH or hCG improved the chances of P/AI in cows with very poor ({\textless}30\%) and poor (30.1 to 45\%) fertility, whereas treatment did not benefit cows with very good fertility ({\textgreater}60.1\%). Moreover, treatment with GnRH and hCG improved the chances of P/AI in primiparous cows. The improvement was much better in primiparous cows with very low fertility. Treatment with buserelin at a dose above 10 µg and with hCG at a dose above 2,500 IU was associated with increased chances of P/AI compared with lower doses. Treatment with GnRH 10 d after AI was also associated with increased chances of P/AI compared with earlier treatment. The present meta-analysis showed that the use of GnRH and hCG after AI should be focused on cows expected to have low or moderate fertility. Day and dose of treatment have to be considered as well.},

	abstract = {Although several studies have suggested that anti-inflammatory strategies reduce secondary infarct growth in animal stroke models, clinical studies have not yet demonstrated a clear benefit of immune modulation in patients. Potential reasons include systematic differences of post-ischemic neuroinflammation between humans and rodents. We here performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize and compare the spatial and temporal distribution of immune cell infiltration in human and rodent stroke. Data on spatiotemporal distribution of immune cells (T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils) and infarct volume were extracted. Data from all rodent studies were pooled by means of a random-effect meta-analysis. Overall, 20 human and 188 rodent stroke studies were included in our analyses. In both patients and rodents, the infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils preceded the lymphocytic influx. Macrophages and neutrophils were the predominant immune cells within 72 h after infarction. Although highly heterogeneously across studies, the temporal profile of the poststroke immune response was comparable between patients and rodents. In rodent stroke, the extent of the immune cell infiltration depended on the duration and location of vessel occlusion and on the species. The density of infiltrating immune cells correlated with the infarct volume. In summary, we provide the first systematic analysis and comparison of human and rodent post-ischemic neuroinflammation. Our data suggest that the inflammatory response in rodent stroke models is comparable to that in patients with stroke. However, the overall heterogeneity of the post-ischemic immune response might contribute to the translational failure in stroke research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: p53 is a tumor suppressor protein involved in regulating a wide array of signaling pathways. The role of p53 in the cell is determined by the type of imposed oxidative stress, its intensity and duration. The last decade of research has unravelled a dual nature in the function of p53 in mediating the oxidative stress burden. However, this is dependent on the specific properties of the applied stress and thus requires further analysis. METHODS: A systematic review was performed following an electronic search of Pubmed, Google Scholar, and ScienceDirect databases. Articles published in the English language between January 1, 1990 and March 1, 2017 were identified and isolated based on the analysis of p53 in skeletal muscle in both animal and cell culture models. RESULTS: Literature was categorized according to the modality of imposed oxidative stress including exercise, diet modification, exogenous oxidizing agents, tissue manipulation, irradiation, and hypoxia. With low to moderate levels of oxidative stress, p53 is involved in activating pathways that increase time for cell repair, such as cell cycle arrest and autophagy, to enhance cell survival. However, with greater levels of stress intensity and duration, such as with irradiation, hypoxia, and oxidizing agents, the role of p53 switches to facilitate increased cellular stress levels by initiating DNA fragmentation to induce apoptosis, thereby preventing aberrant cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: Current evidence confirms that p53 acts as a threshold regulator of cellular homeostasis. Therefore, within each modality, the intensity and duration are parameters of the oxidative stressor that must be analyzed to determine the role p53 plays in regulating signaling pathways to maintain cellular health and function in skeletal muscle.

	abstract = {Batoids (Chondrichthyes: Batoidea; e.g. stingrays, skates, and guitarfish) comprise more than 55\% of elasmobranch taxa and represent ecologically important predators in benthic and pelagic habitats. Although overexploitation and habitat degradation are the two biggest threats to batoid populations, coastal and oceanic pollution is also a pervasive potential threat. In this systematic review, we compile published scientific literature on trace metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) contamination in elasmobranch species of the Batoidea superorder and present contamination patterns, exposure effects, and potential human exposure risks to most reported contaminants. We found batoids to accumulate a wide range of trace metals, including mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn). Accumulation of POPs is reported for chlordanes, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), dieldrin, Heptachlor epoxide, hexachlorobenzene and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Hg levels in muscle tissue were significantly different among oceanic basins and habitats, consistent with previous global assessments of Hg oceanic background levels. Some batoid species presented Hg levels higher than large pelagic teleost fishes and comparable to sharks. Ecological traits such as, bottom feeding, upper trophic position and elasmobranch-specific physiology and metabolism are discussed as potential factors associated with Hg uptake and accumulation in batoids. Some species exceeded USEPA's maximum contamination safety limits in edible tissues for Hg, As and ΣPCBs. For most trace metals and POPs, there is a lack of studies focusing on contamination levels in batoids. We recommend future research increasing reporting on POPs and trace metals besides Hg in batoids to further investigate the role of Elasmobranch as a bioindicator for marine pollution.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Azoles are considered as one of the most efficient fungicides for the treatment of humans, animals, and plant fungal pathogens. They are of significant clinical importance as antifungal drugs and are widely used in personal care products, ultraviolet stabilizers, and in aircraft for its anti-corrosive properties. The prevalence of azole compounds in the natural environment and its accumulation in fish raises questions about its impact on aquatic organisms. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this paper is to review the scientific studies on the effects of azole compounds in fish and to discuss future opportunities for the risk evaluation. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted on Web of Science, PubMed, and ScienceDirect to locate peer-reviewed scientific articles on occurrence, environmental fate, and toxicological impact of azole fungicides on fish. RESULTS: Studies included in this review provide ample evidence that azole compounds are not only commonly detected in the natural environment but also cause several detrimental effects on fish. Future studies with environmentally relevant concentrations of azole alone or in combination with other commonly occurring contaminants in a multigenerational study could provide a better understanding. CONCLUSION: Based on current knowledge and studies reporting adverse biological effects of azole on fish, considerable attention is required for better management and effective ecological risk assessment of these emerging contaminants.},

Out of the total 3,442 studies retrieved by the electronic search, 9 were found to be suitable as per the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. The majority of these studies (6 out of 9) demonstrated improvement in cardiovascular autonomic control after RT in animals; however, three studies did not illustrate any significant change. Standardised mean differences (SMD) showed a significant effect of RT on root mean square of successive differences between adjacent inter-beat (R-R) intervals (RMSSD) [SMD (confidence interval (CI))=4.56 (2.89, 6.23); P{\textless}0.0001] and bradycardic response to change in arterial blood pressure [SMD (CI)=-2.27 (-4.50, -0.03; P=0.05)] whereas no significant change was observed for other variables of cardiac autonomic control post-RT. The present systematic review do not give a clear conclusion regarding the effect of RT on cardiac autonomic control in animal models and thus highlight the need for good quality research in future.},

At the tissue and cellular level, both inflammatory and oxidative processes may be exacerbated post-injury and contribute to further brain damage. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has the potential to downregulate both processes. This review focuses on the potential neuroprotective utility of NAC and N-acetylcysteine amide (NACA) post-TBI. METHODS: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched up to July 2017. Studies that examined clinical and laboratory effects of NAC and NACA post-TBI in human and animal studies were included. Risk of bias was assessed in human and animal studies according to the design of each study (randomized or not). The primary outcome assessed was the effect of NAC/NACA treatment on functional outcome, while secondary outcomes included the impact on biomarkers of inflammation and oxidation. Due to the clinical and methodological heterogeneity observed across studies, no meta-analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Our analyses revealed only three human trials, including two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 20 animal studies conducted using standardized animal models of brain injury. The two RCTs reported improvement in the functional outcome post-NAC/NACA administration. Overall, the evidence from animal studies is more robust and demonstrated substantial improvement of cognition and psychomotor performance following NAC/NACA use. Animal studies also reported significantly more cortical sparing, reduced apoptosis, and lower levels of biomarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress. No safety concerns were reported in any of the studies included in this analysis. CONCLUSION: Evidence from the animal literature demonstrates a robust association for the prophylactic application of NAC and NACA post-TBI with improved neurofunctional outcomes and downregulation of inflammatory and oxidative stress markers at the tissue level. While a growing body of scientific literature suggests putative beneficial effects of NAC/NACA treatment for TBI, the lack of well-designed and controlled clinical investigations, evaluating therapeutic outcomes, prognostic biomarkers, and safety profiles, limits definitive interpretation and recommendations for its application in humans at this time.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Snakebite is a neglected tropical disease that leads to more than 120,000 deaths every year. In 2019, World Health Organization (WHO) launched a strategy to decrease its global burden by 2030. There is a range of issues around different interventions for the management of snakebite. Decisions around these interventions should be informed by evidence from systematic reviews (SR). METHODS: An overview of SRs was conducted by searching 12 electronic databases, PROSPERO, contacting experts and screening the bibliography of included reviews. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment (through AMSTAR-2) was done by at least two overview authors independently with discrepancies sorted by consensus. A narrative synthesis was conducted. PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: The overview found 13 completed SRs that has looked at various aspects of management of snakebite envenomation. There was one SR on first aid, nine on effectiveness and safety of snake anti-venom (SAV), two on drugs to prevent adverse reactions due to SAV therapy, and one on surgical interventions for management of snakebite envenomation. All, except one, SR was appraised to have critically low confidence as per AMSTAR-2 Criteria. Evidence base was restricted to few studies for most interventions. DISCUSSION: High quality evidence from SRs is required to inform guidelines and health system decisions which can bring down the burden of snakebite. The review indicates the need to fund high-quality SRs, evidence gaps and core outcome sets which can inform guideline recommendations, funding priorities for conduct of future trials. Variation in species distribution as well as intra-species variation in venom composition implies the need for conduct of region or, nation or state (sub-national) specific randomised controlled trials and SRs on different SAVs and their dosing regimens.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Reducing meat consumption can help prevent non-communicable diseases and protect the environment. Interventions targeting conscious determinants of human behaviour are generally acceptable approaches to promote dietary change, but little is known about their effectiveness to reduce the demand for meat. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions targeting conscious determinants of human behaviour to reduce the demand for meat. METHODS: We searched six electronic databases on the 31st of August 2017 with a predefined algorithm, screened publicly accessible resources, contacted authors, and conducted forward and backward reference searches. Eligible studies employed experimental designs to evaluate interventions targeting conscious determinants of human behaviour to reduce the consumption, purchase, or selection of meat in comparison to a control condition, a baseline period, or relative to other eligible interventions. We synthesised results narratively and conducted an exploratory crisp-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to identify combinations of intervention characteristics associated with significant reductions in the demand for meat. RESULTS: We included 24 papers reporting on 59 interventions and 25,477 observations. Self-monitoring interventions and individual lifestyle counselling led to, or were associated with reduced meat consumption. Providing information about the health or environmental consequences of eating meat was associated with reduced intentions to consume and select meat in virtual environments, but there was no evidence to suggest this approach influenced actual behaviour. Education about the animal welfare consequences of eating meat was associated with reduced intentions to consume meat, while interventions implicitly highlighting animal suffering were not. Education on multiple consequences of eating meat led to mixed results. Tailored education was not found to reduce actual or intended meat consumption, though few studies assessed this approach. CONCLUSION: Some interventions targeting conscious determinants of human behaviour have the potential to reduce the demand for meat. In particular, self-monitoring interventions and individual lifestyle counselling can help to reduce meat consumption. There was evidence of effectiveness of some educational messages in reducing intended consumption and selection of meat in virtual environments. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: CRD42017076720 .},

This infectious disease is mainly transmitted by indirect exposure to urine of asymptomatic animals via the environment. As human cases generally occur after heavy rain, an emerging hypothesis suggests that rainfall re-suspend leptospires together with soil particles. Bacteria are then carried to surface water, where humans get exposed. It is currently assumed that pathogenic leptospires can survive in the environment but do not multiply. However, little is known on their capacity to survive in a soil and freshwater environment.},

In order to collate the empirical information that is available regarding animal welfare in zoos and aquariums with regard to topics, methods and species, a systematic literature review was conducted of the primary peer-reviewed journals publishing zoo-based and welfare-based research. Journals included Animal Welfare, Animals, Applied Animal Behaviour Science, International Zoo Yearbook, Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science, Journal of Zoo and Aquarium Research, and Zoo Biology. The literature review spanned 2008-2017 and revealed that 7.6\% (n=310) of reviewed publications (n=4,096) in these journals were zoo- or aquarium-based and animal-welfare focused. The main topics studied included enrichment, social conditions and enclosure design, while understudied topics included the welfare of ambassador animals, and the welfare impacts of sound and light. Behaviour was by far the dominant welfare parameter used and the use of hormonal measures declined over this period. Taxonomic representation in these publications was notably skewed. Mammals were the focus of 75\% of studies, and 82\% of studies were vertebrate-focused (great apes being the dominant taxa). This study considers potential reasons for these patterns and highlights research areas for future emphasis that could serve to fill gaps in current knowledge regarding zoo and aquarium animal welfare, including more research into affective states that underlie an animal's welfare status.},

	abstract = {Research on the potential impact of interventions in agriculture on nutrition outcomes is of particular relevance in South Asia where agriculture-related activities are a major source of livelihoods for large sections of society and where the population suffers from one of the highest global burdens of malnutrition in all its forms. This systematic review aims to assess the strength of the available evidence that agricultural interventions have an impact on intermediate and final nutrition outcomes in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Afghanistan. We searched five literature databases and reference lists of previous systematic reviews to identify peer-reviewed studies published between 2012 and 2017, detailing impacts of household- or farm-level agricultural interventions on nutritional outcomes in South Asia. We identified six intervention studies (reported in nine papers) conducted in Bangladesh (two studies), India (two studies) and Nepal (two studies). The majority of studies examined the impact of provision of seed, plants and training to increase home garden fruit and vegetable production with or without integrated poultry provision and training. Other studies evaluated the impact of livestock or aquaculture provision and training. Study designs and quality were mixed; heterogeneity across studies precluded formal meta-analysis. Interventions had a positive impact on intermediate outcomes on the pathway from agricultural intervention to nutritional or health status including dietary quality and dietary diversity of households and individuals (reported in seven papers). The evidence on the impact on final nutritional outcomes was mixed: one paper reported that home gardens with poultry reduced the odds of anaemia but there was no convincing evidence of an impact of agricultural interventions on child anthropometric measurement (reported in four papers). In recent years, the Leveraging Agriculture for Nutrition in South Asia (LANSA) research programme consortium has significantly expanded research on agricultural interventions for nutrition outcomes by conducting and commissioning a suite of formative and feasibility studies that have extended both the range and geographic location of interventions under study. This expanding body of research should, in the future, enable the identification of cost-effective interventions to enhance the impact of agricultural interventions sustainably to improve nutrition outcomes especially in women and children in South Asia.},

The disease has been relevant since the epidemics taken place in Rio de Janeiro in the end of the 20th century, although it was recognized by the government agencies, still considered neglected and underdiagnosed. The meta-analysis study involving 147 works published between 2010 and 2020 revealed that Brazil was highlighted in the occurrence of sporotrichosis, including demonstrating greater global scientific production and figuring a central role in coordinating actions for scientific collaboration with other countries. These joint actions have resulted in social media campaigns, alerting cat guardians of the risks and how the disease presents clinically. Although its good prognosis, the disease has become a public health problem in the diverse regions of Brasil, affecting humans and cats. The observation of the clinical signs and history associated to the diagnostic means are essential to the identification of the Sporotrichosis, by the means of diagnosis, the growth and cytology considered golden standard to identify the agent Sporthrix sp.

Humans and animals may drink arsenic-contaminated groundwater in addition to consuming foods that have been grown in arsenic-contaminated groundwater and soils. Rice grain is a potential arsenic carrier and the staple food in many parts of the world, particularly in Southeast Asian countries. Data have been summarized from 183 articles describing different aspects of arsenic flow in the food chain, that is, the soil-water-rice-human system and the water-crops-animals system and the bio-availability of arsenic to humans and animals. The phyto-availability of arsenic depends on the physicochemical and biological conditions of soil and water. In humans, the bio-accessibility of inorganic arsenic is 63-99\%. Arsenic is more bio-available from rice than from other foods: different food materials differ in bio-accessible potential. Additionally, the review identifies trends in research on arsenic contamination and food chain flow considering arsenic species, toxicity assessment, and bio-accessibility studies. This systematic review provides a comprehensive assessment of the documented evidence to be used to guide future research on arsenic availability for the rice plant and subsequent availability to humans from cooked rice that can determine arsenic toxicity. The review also highlights how the focus of research on arsenic as a pollutant has changed in the past decades.},

DESIGN: Standardized, systematic evaluation of the literature, categorization of relevant articles according to level of evidence (LOE) and quality (Good, Fair, or Poor), and development of consensus on conclusions via a Delphi-style survey for application of the concepts to clinical practice. SETTINGS: Academic and referral veterinary medical centers. RESULTS: Databases searched included Medline via PubMed and CAB abstracts. Eight different antithrombotic drugs were investigated using a standardized Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) question format both for dogs and cats, including aspirin, clopidogrel, warfarin, unfractionated heparin (UFH), dalteparin, enoxaparin, fondaparinux, and rivaroxaban, generating a total of 16 worksheets. Most studies identified were experimental controlled laboratory studies in companion animals (LOE 3) with only four randomized controlled clinical trials in companion animals (LOE 1). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, evidence-based recommendations concerning specific protocols could not be formulated for most antithrombotic drugs evaluated, either because of the wide range of dosage reported (eg, aspirin in dogs) or the lack of evidence in the current literature. However, clopidogrel administration in dogs and cats at risk of arterial thrombosis, notably in cats at risk of cardiogenic thromboembolism, is supported by the literature, and specific protocols were recommended. Comparably, aspirin should not be used as a sole antithrombotic in cats with cardiomyopathy. Using the available safety profile information contained in the literature, the panel reached consensus on suggested dosage schemes for most antithrombotics. Significant knowledge gaps were highlighted, which will hopefully drive novel research.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The US Food and Drug Administration warned that exposure of pregnant women to general anaesthetics may impair fetal brain development. This review systematically evaluates the evidence underlying this warning. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched from inception until April 3, 2020. Preclinical and clinical studies were eligible. Exclusion criteria included case reports, in vitro models, chronic exposures, and exposure only during delivery. Meta-analyses were performed on standardised mean differences. The primary outcome was overall effect on learning/memory. Secondary outcomes included markers of neuronal injury (apoptosis, synapse formation, neurone density, and proliferation) and subgroup analyses. RESULTS: There were 65 preclinical studies included, whereas no clinical studies could be identified. Anaesthesia during pregnancy impaired learning and memory (standardised mean difference -1.16, 95\% confidence interval -1.46 to -0.85) and resulted in neuronal injury in all experimental models, irrespective of the anaesthetic drugs and timing in pregnancy. Risk of bias was high in most studies. Rodents were the most frequently used animal species, although their brain development differs significantly from that in humans. In a minority of studies, anaesthesia was combined with surgery. Monitoring and strict control of physiological homeostasis were below preclinical and clinical standards in many studies. The duration and frequency of exposure and anaesthetic doses were often much higher than in clinical routine. CONCLUSION: Anaesthesia-induced neurotoxicity during pregnancy is a consistent finding in preclinical studies, but translation of these results to the clinical situation is limited by several factors.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dietary nitrate is an important source of nitric oxide (NO), a molecule critical for cardiovascular health. Nitrate is sequentially reduced to NO through an enterosalivary nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway that involves the oral microbiome. This pathway is considered an important adjunct pathway to the classical l-arginine-NO synthase pathway. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to systematically assess the evidence for dietary nitrate intake and improved cardiovascular health from both human and animal studies. DESIGN: A systematic literature search was performed according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines by using key search terms in Medline and EMBASE databases and defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Thirty-seven articles on humans and 14 articles on animals were included from 12,541 screened references. Data on the effects of dietary nitrate on blood pressure, endothelial function, ischemic reperfusion injury, arterial stiffness, platelet function, and cerebral blood flow in both human and animal models were identified. Beneficial effects of nitrate on vascular health have predominantly been observed in healthy human populations, whereas effects in populations at risk of cardiovascular disease are less clear. Few studies have investigated the long-term effects of dietary nitrate on cardiovascular disease clinical endpoints. In animal studies, there is evidence that nitrate improves blood pressure and endothelial function, particularly in animal models with reduced NO bioavailability. Nitrate dose seems to be a critical factor because there is evidence of cross-talk between the 2 pathways of NO production. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence for a beneficial effect in humans at risk of cardiovascular disease is limited. Furthermore, there is a need to investigate the long-term effects of dietary nitrate on cardiovascular disease clinical endpoints. Further animal studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms behind the observed effects.},

Thus, in order to search for potential cold-tolerance biomarkers in fish at a post-transcriptional level, the aim of this work is to systematic review current literature on miRNAs related to low temperature in teleost fish and answer the question: are there any miRNAs related to key mechanisms of cold-tolerance in fish? Through a systematic search in 3 different databases, a total of 418 studies were initially identified. After criterious screening, 6 studies were included in the systematic review. At least 71 miRNAs were reported to be differentially expressed (DE) in fish exposed to low temperatures, from which 29 were considered up regulated and 42 down regulated in cold stressed fish. Among the total number of DE miRNAs, 6 were found to be present in at least two studies: miR-9-3p, miR-135c, miR-9-5p, miR-30b, miR-122, miR-92a-3p. DE miRNAs presented in at least two studies were submitted to DIANA mirPath v.3 to identify potential target genes using microT-CDS v 5.0 database. These miRNAs potentially target key regulatory enzymes to glucose and lipid metabolism, controlling the shift in energy metabolism required for cold adaptation. FoxO signaling and circadian cycle are also very likely involved in thermal tolerance mechanisms. These findings represent potential targets for further investigation of microRNA-based predictive tools for fish cold tolerance.},

The therapeutic role of atropine is well-established for patients with acute OP poisoning. The benefit of adding 2-pyridine aldoxime methyl chloride (2-PAM), however, is controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials (RCT) to compare 2-PAM plus atropine in comparison to atropine alone for acute OP poisoning. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS up to March 2017. The Cochrane review handbook was used to assess the risk of bias. Data were abstracted and risk ratios (RR) were calculated for mortality, rate of intubation, duration of intubation, intermediate syndrome, and complications such as hospital-acquired infections, dysrhythmias, and pulmonary edema. We found five studies comprising 586 patients with varying risks of bias. The risk of death (RR = 1.5, 95\% CI 0.9-2.5); intubation (RR = 1.3, 95\% CI 1.0-1.6); intermediate syndrome (RR = 1.6, 95\% CI 1.0-2.6); complications (RR = 1.2, 95\% CI 0.8-1.8); and the duration of intubation (mean difference 0.0, 95\% CI - 1.6-1.6) were not significantly different between the atropine plus 2-PAM and atropine alone. Based on our meta-analysis of the available RCTs, 2-PAM was not shown to improve outcomes in patients with acute OP poisoning.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to synthesize the literature on consumer preferences for farm animal welfare (FAW), with an emphasis on characterizing consumers based on their FAW preferences. The objective is to provide insights into the salient characteristics associated with animal welfare conscious consumers. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct a systematic review of the results of published research on consumer preferences for FAW. Approximately 350 papers were reviewed, and 52 were included in the analysis. Findings: The authors' review suggests that consumers are not homogenous in their preferences for FAW. The authors identify seven themes that enabled them to characterize consumers with higher FAW preferences. These themes (i.e. age, education and income, gender, country and cross-cultural differences, attitudes and consumer and citizen functions) are grouped under four main headings (socio-demographics, ethics and attitudes, product characteristics and public roles). Research limitations/implications: The authors' synthesis reflects the findings reported in the literature to this date; the identified characteristics may change with time as new evidence becomes available. Practical implications: The information collected in this article would be useful to farmers and food and non-food retailers interested in effective product differentiation and marketing strategies regarding FAW standards. It can also inform policymakers about the state of consumer concerns for FAW. Originality/value: To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first study that attempts to develop a systematic profile of consumers based on their FAW preferences.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Russia is traditionally an endemic area for Taenia saginata infection, where a programme for the prevention of infection has been implemented for sixty years. This paper aims, therefore, to review the recent epidemiology data of Taenia saginata infection in the Russian Federation. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review of published and grey literature, and official data for information on the incidence, prevalence and distribution of Taenia saginata taeniosis and cysticercosis in the Russian Federation between 1st January 1991 and 31st December 2017. RESULTS: From the 404 records returned by our search strategy, we identified 17 official county reports, 17 papers and one meeting abstract on the occurrence of taeniosis or cysticercosis from the Russian Federation, eligible for inclusion in this study. In the Russian Federation, Taenia saginata infection has been continuously present and notifiable in the study period between 1991-2016. In the same area, a continuous decrease in the incidence of human taeniosis cases was observed, from 1.4 to 0.04 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, as well as a reduction in the territory where the infection is reported. The prevalence of bovine cysticercosis, ranging between 0.1-19.0\%, generally has a declining trend, especially after 2005. CONCLUSIONS: Importance of Taenia saginata infection as a medical and veterinary problem has been decreasing in the 21st century but it is still an infection with health and economic impact in the Russian Federation.},

Animal models of mTBI are essential for understanding mechanisms, and pathological outcomes, as well as to test therapeutic interventions. A variety of closed head models of mTBI that incorporate different aspects (i.e., biomechanics) of the mTBI have been reported. The aim of the current review was to compile a comprehensive list of the closed head mTBI rodent models, along with the common data elements, and outcomes, with the goal to summarize the current state of the field. Publications were identified from a search of PubMed and Web of Science and screened for eligibility following PRISMA guidelines. Articles were included that were closed head injuries in which the authors classified the injury as mild in rats or mice. Injury model and animal-specific common data elements, as well as behavioral and histological outcomes, were collected and compiled from a total of 402 articles. Our results outline the wide variety of methods used to model mTBI. We also discovered that female rodents and both young and aged animals are under-represented in experimental mTBI studies. Our findings will aid in providing context comparing the injury models and provide a starting point for the selection of the most appropriate model of mTBI to address a specific hypothesis. We believe this review will be a useful starting place for determining what has been done and what knowledge is missing in the field to reduce the burden of mTBI.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of rodents in Leptospira epidemiology and transmission is well known worldwide. Rats are known to carry different pathogenic serovars of Leptospira spp. capable of causing disease in humans and animals. Wild rats (Rattus spp.), especially the Norway/brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) and the black rat (R. rattus), are the most important sources of Leptospira infection, as they are abundant in urban and peridomestic environments. In this study, we compiled and summarized available data in the literature on global prevalence of Leptospira exposure and infection in rats, as well as compared the global distribution of Leptospira spp. in rats with respect to prevalence, geographic location, method of detection, diversity of serogroups/serovars, and species of rat. METHODS: We conducted a thorough literature search using PubMed without restrictions on publication date as well as Google Scholar to manually search for other relevant articles. Abstracts were included if they described data pertaining to Leptospira spp. in rats (Rattus spp.) from any geographic region around the world, including reviews. The data extracted from the articles selected included the author(s), year of publication, geographic location, method(s) of detection used, species of rat(s), sample size, prevalence of Leptospira spp. (overall and within each rat species), and information on species, serogroups, and/or serovars of Leptospira spp. detected. FINDINGS: A thorough search on PubMed retrieved 303 titles. After screening the articles for duplicates and inclusion/exclusion criteria, as well as manual inclusion of relevant articles, 145 articles were included in this review. Leptospira prevalence in rats varied considerably based on geographic location, with some reporting zero prevalence in countries such as Madagascar, Tanzania, and the Faroe Islands, and others reporting as high as {\textgreater}80\% prevalence in studies done in Brazil, India, and the Philippines. The top five countries that were reported based on number of articles include India (n = 13), Malaysia (n = 9), Brazil (n = 8), Thailand (n = 7), and France (n = 6). Methods of detecting or isolating Leptospira spp. also varied among studies. Studies among different Rattus species reported a higher Leptospira prevalence in R. norvegicus. The serovar Icterohaemorrhagiae was the most prevalent serovar reported in Rattus spp. worldwide. Additionally, this literature review provided evidence for Leptospira infection in laboratory rodent colonies within controlled environments, implicating the zoonotic potential to laboratory animal caretakers. CONCLUSIONS: Reports on global distribution of Leptospira infection in rats varies widely, with considerably high prevalence reported in many countries. This literature review emphasizes the need for enhanced surveillance programs using standardized methods for assessing Leptospira exposure or infection in rats. This review also demonstrated several weaknesses to the current methods of reporting the prevalence of Leptospira spp. in rats worldwide. As such, this necessitates a call for standardized protocols for the testing and reporting of such studies, especially pertaining to the diagnostic methods used. A deeper understanding of the ecology and epidemiology of Leptospira spp. in rats in urban environments is warranted. It is also pertinent for rat control programs to be proposed in conjunction with increased efforts for public awareness and education regarding leptospirosis transmission and prevention.},

We found that SFT was influenced by and increased linearly with hot carcass weights (HCWs) and cold carcass weights (CCWs) and their yields; moreover, the bone fraction decreased whereas the muscle and fat fractions increased with higher levels of SFT. No significant differences were detected in meat quality variables. Thus, SFT appeared to have a direct influence on HCW, CCW, and the weight and yield of bone, muscle, and fat of castrated steers. A uniform fat thickness level of 6.0 mm SFT was determined to be the standard of quality of carcasses and meat products for consumers.},

The aim of this review was to summarize the current knowledge of RFs for AMU in veal calves, pigs and poultry. Thirty-three observational studies were included. Well-identified RFs for an increased AMU are frequent purchase of animals, herd size (large or small depending on the animal species), and a lack of selected biosecurity measures. Also in beef breed calves, more antimicrobials are used than in Holstein calves. AMU is influenced by the farmer, the veterinarian and by the integration. In general, socio-economic RFs are largely unexplored. The causal factors for AMU are multiple and complex, with possible confounding factors and unidentified interactions. Additional knowledge of socio-economic drivers appears particularly urgent to create tailor-made guidelines and awareness campaigns for each sector.},

	abstract = {Snakebite is a Neglected Tropical Disease estimated to cause more than 100,000 human deaths and disable more than 400,000 victims each year. It primarily affects poor agricultural workers, farmers, and cattle herders living in rural areas of developing countries. It is thus an occupational disease. However, the impact of snakebite on these rural communities could be even higher if a One Health approach is taken to consider the direct impact on domestic animals and indirect impact on the livelihood of affected communities. To explore this hypothesis we developed the first scoping review to identify and characterize the global literature on snakebite in domestic animals. Three bibliographic databases (PubMed, Web of Science and Agricola) were searched using terms related to snake, snakebite and domestic animals for publications up to December 31(st), 2016. Two independent reviewers screened publications applying inclusion/exclusion criteria to select relevant material. Relevant information was then extracted from the selected literature. The global literature on snakebite in domestic animals (n = 143 observational studies, reviews and letters) mainly represented North America, Europe and Australia (69\%) with less information from Central and South America, Asia and Africa (31\%). Observational studies (n = 119) mostly concerned pets (78\%) and to a lesser extent livestock (22\%). Thirty-four snake species were reported as responsible for bites in domestic animals. WHO's Medically Important Venomous Snakes were more frequently involved. The social-ecological determinants of snakebite were poorly documented but the reviewed literature suggested a strong seasonality and a diversity of habitat. Snakebite in animals caused neurotoxic, cytotoxic and hemotoxic envenomation syndromes similar to humans and death. Half of publications on envenomed livestock reported a fatality rate above 47\%. There was no literature on the indirect impact of snakebite on livelihood caused by animal morbidity and mortality. The results of this scoping review suggest a high and under-reported burden in terms of mortality in animals and a potential economic impact of snakebite in terms of losses in livelihood of affected communities. However, major knowledge gaps with respect to impact of snakebite on livestock and livelihood were identified. Filling these gaps is necessary for a full understanding of the impact of snakebite and to raise scientific, political and public awareness on this neglected issue.},

The spread of these parasitic infections overlays in several epidemiological locations and the host shows different outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis determine the pooled prevalence of malaria and intestinal helminthiases coinfections among malaria suspected patients in Ethiopia. METHODS: Primary studies published in English language were retrieved using appropriate search terms on Google Scholar, PubMed/MEDLINE, CINHAL, Scopus, and Embase. The Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) was used for critical appraisal of studies. A pooled statistical meta-analysis was conducted using STATA Version 14.0 software. The heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed using the I2 statistics and Egger's test, respectively. Duval and Tweedie's nonparametric trim and fill analysis using the random-effect analysis. The Random effects model was used to estimate the summary prevalence of comorbidity of malaria and soil transmitted helminthiases and the corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (CI). The review protocol has registered in PROSPERO number CRD42019144803. RESULTS: We identified ten studies (n = 6633 participants) in this study. The overall pooled result showed 13\% of the ambulatory patients infected by malaria and intestinal helminths concurrently in Ethiopia. The pooled prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, and mixed infections were 12, 30, and 6\%, respectively. The most common intestinal helminth parasites detected were Hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Tirchuris trichiura. CONCLUSIONS: The comorbidity of malaria and intestinal helminths causes lower hemoglobin level leading to maternal anemia, preterm delivery, and still birth in pregnant women and lactating mother. School-aged children and neonates coinfected by plasmodium species and soil transmitted helminths develop cognitive impairment, protein energy malnutrition, low birth weight, small for gestational age, and gross motor delay. The Ministry of Health of Ethiopia and its international partners working on malaria elimination programs should give more emphasis to the effect of the interface of malaria and soil transmitted helminths, which calls for an integrated disease control and prevention.},

	abstract = {In recent years, and now especially with the arrival of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there has been increased interest in understanding the role of bats in the dynamics of transmission and origin of this pandemic agent. To date, no systematic reviews have been published on this topic. This systematic review aimed to summarize and highlight the frequency of bat infections reported in currently available observational studies for coronavirus. The purpose of this study was also to examine the differences between the pool prevalence by technique and country. We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess coronavirus (CoV) infection in bats and its diagnosis by serological and molecular tests. We carried out random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence and 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI). In all, 824 articles were retrieved (1960-2021). After screening by abstract/title, 43 articles were selected for full-text assessment. Of these, 33 were finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. From the total of studies, the pool prevalence by RT-PCR (n=14,295 bats) for CoV was 9.8\% (95\% CI 8.7-10.9\%); Italy reported the highest pooled prevalence (44.9\%, 95\% CI 31.6-58.1\%), followed by the Philippines (29.6\%). Regarding the ELISA, the pool prevalence for coronavirus from 15 studies, including 359 bats, was 30.2\% (95\% CI 14.7-45.6\%). The results for coronaviruses with the MIF were significantly lower, 2.6\% (95\% CI 1.5-3.7\%). A considerable proportion of infected bats tested positive, particularly by molecular tests. This essential condition highlights the relevance of bats and the need for future studies to detail their role as potential reservoirs of SARS-CoV-2. In this meta-analysis, bats were positive in almost 10\% by RT-PCR, suggesting their relevance and the need to understand their potential participation in maintaining wild zoonotic transmission.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Coronaviruses are zoonotic viruses that include human epidemic pathogens such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS-CoV), and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus (SARS-CoV), among others (e.g., COVID-19, the recently emerging coronavirus disease). The role of animals as potential reservoirs for such pathogens remains an unanswered question. No systematic reviews have been published on this topic to date. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review with meta-analysis, using three databases to assess MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection in animals and its diagnosis by serological and molecular tests. We performed a random-effects model meta-analysis to calculate the pooled prevalence and 95\% confidence interval (95\%CI). RESULTS: 6,493articles were retrieved (1960-2019). After screening by abstract/title, 50 articles were selected for full-text assessment. Of them, 42 were finally included for qualitative and quantitative analyses. From a total of 34 studies (n=20,896 animals), the pool prevalence by RT-PCR for MERS-CoV was 7.2\% (95\%CI 5.6-8.7\%), with 97.3\% occurring in camels, in which pool prevalence was 10.3\% (95\%CI 8.3-12.3). Qatar was the country with the highest MERS-CoV RT-PCR pool prevalence: 32.6\% (95\%CI 4.8-60.4\%). From 5 studies and 2,618 animals, for SARS-CoV, the RT-PCR pool prevalence was 2.3\% (95\%CI 1.3-3.3). Of those, 38.35\% were reported on bats, in which the pool prevalence was 14.1\% (95\%CI0.0-44.6\%). DISCUSSION: A considerable proportion of infected animals tested positive, particularly by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT). This essential condition highlights the relevance of individual animals as reservoirs of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. In this meta-analysis, camels and bats were found to be positive by RT-PCR in over 10\% of the cases for both; thus, suggesting their relevance in the maintenance of wild zoonotic transmission.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0216150},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Paleoparasitology, the study of parasites in the past, brings the knowledge of where and when they occurred in preterit populations. Some groups of parasites, as capillariids, have a complex and controversial systematic, hindering the paleoparasitological diagnosis. In this article, we synthesized the occurrence of capillariids in both the New and the Old World in ancient times, and discussed the difficulty of the diagnosis of species and the strategies for identification. The present review also shows the current status of the phylogeny in capillariids and indicates the necessity to try new approaches for a better understanding of capillariid paleodistribution. METHODS: For the systematic review, a predefined guideline defined by PRISMA was used. The articles collected were identified, screened, and included in the review following criteria for eligibility. The current status of the phylogeny of capillariids was accessed using MUSCLE, Bioedit v.7.0.5 and MEGA v. 7.0.21 programs. RESULTS: The review discussed 38 articles that presented information about capillariids in past populations. Most of capillariid eggs found in the New and Old World were not identified. However, Calodium hepaticum eggs were the most identified, as some from Eucoleus genus. It was observed that sites from the New World had a better chance for capillariid egg identification, due to previous knowledge of its host, when compared to the Old World. In the 18S rDNA phylogenetic analyses, two datasets were constructed, one including sequences from 7 Moravec's genera, where 3 genus-specific clusters, with high bootstrap values, could be observed for Capillaria (ML = 99\%, NJ = 96\%), Eucoleus (ML / NJ = 100\%) and Paratrichosoma (ML / NJ = 100\%). A fourth cluster of 18S rDNA dataset I revealed lack of definition of Pearsonema and Aonchotheca genera. The 18S rDNA dataset II comprised 8 Moravec's genera and defined 3 clusters, 2 genus-specific for Eucoleus (ML = 99\%, NJ = 100\%) and Capillaria (ML / NJ = 98\%). The third 18S rDNA dataset II cluster included 6 genera and exhibited, once again, Pearsonema and Aonchotheca poor discrimination. The cox1 gene data consist of 4 Moravec's genera, and in spite of grouping some species-specific clusters, did not show genera-specific definition. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the numerous archaeological findings, both in the New and the Old Worlds, the identification of capillariid species based on the morphology and morphometry of eggs remains imprecise, often resulting in a generic diagnosis of a group or morphotype of capillariid. Capillariid is one of the most diverse group of helminths recovered in archaeological sites. The phylogenetic trees produced in this study showed limited genetic information available, unresolved genera and incongruence with the classical taxonomy. The elucidation of the paleodistribution of capillariids can give insights of the ancient host-parasite associations but also in modern sceneries.},

	abstract = {Incomplete luteal regression after treatment with a single dose of prostaglandin F(2α) during an Ovsynch protocol decreases fertility to timed artificial insemination (TAI). To increase the proportion of cows with complete luteal regression and subsequently pregnancy per artificial insemination (P/AI), an additional treatment with PGF(2α) 24 h after the first has been recommended. A systematic review of the literature and meta-analytical assessment were performed with the objective of evaluating the effects of adding a second PGF(2α) treatment during the Ovsynch protocol on luteal regression and reproductive performance in lactating dairy cows. Based on the heterogeneity among the experimental treatments, a fixed or a random effects meta-analysis was conducted. Reproductive outcomes of interest were luteal regression at the end of the Ovsynch protocol, and P/AI measured 32 to 39 d after TAI. Seven randomized controlled experiments from 6 published manuscripts including 5,356 cows with the primary objective to evaluate the effect of an additional treatment with PGF(2α) during the Ovsynch protocol on P/AI were used. Information regarding luteal regression at the end of the Ovsynch protocol was available for 1,856 cows. Adding a second PGF(2α) treatment on d 8 during the Ovsynch protocol increased the relative risk (RR) of complete luteal regression at the end of the Ovsynch protocol (RR = 1.14; 95\% confidence interval = 1.10 to 1.17) using a fixed effects model and the RR for pregnancy (RR = 1.14; 95\% confidence interval = 1.06 to 1.22) 32 d after TAI using a fixed effects model. No heterogeneity was observed among the 6 manuscripts regarding complete luteal regression and P/AI. In summary, there was a clear benefit of an additional PGF(2α) treatment during the Ovsynch protocol on luteal regression (+11.6 percentage units) and on P/AI (+4.6 percentage units).},

Luteal presence at the beginning of a TAI protocol and ovarian response after the first gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) injection (G1) affect P4 concentration and subsequently pregnancy per artificial insemination (P/AI). A systematic review of the literature and meta-analytical assessment was performed with the objective of evaluating the magnitude of the effect of luteal presence and ovarian response at the beginning of a TAI protocol on P/AI in lactating dairy cows. We considered only studies using synchronisation protocols consisting of GnRH and prostaglandin F (2α). The time interval between G1 and prostaglandin F (2α) (PGF (2α)) had to range from 5 to 7 d. The time interval between the PGF (2α) injection and G2 had to range from 48 to 72 h. We used 28 controlled experiments from 27 published manuscripts including 16,489 cows with the objective of evaluating the effect size of having a functional corpus luteum (CL) at G1 on P/AI. Information regarding ovulatory response after G1 was available for 5676 cows. In a subset of cows (n = 4291), information was available for luteal presence and ovulatory response at the initiation of the TAI protocol. A functional CL at G1 increased (p {\textless} 0.001) the relative risk of conceiving (RR (relative risk) = 1.32; 95\% CI = 1.21-1.45) in lactating dairy cows. Ovulation after G1 increased (p {\textless} 0.001) the relative risk of conceiving (RR = 1.29; 95\% CI = 1.20-1.38) in lactating dairy cows. The effect of ovulatory response on P/AI after G1 was affected by luteal presence at G1. In summary, there was a clear benefit on P/AI for cows starting a TAI protocol with a functional CL (+10.5 percentage units) and cows ovulating at the beginning of a TAI protocol (+11.0 percentage units).},

	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in postoperative pain management. While an increasing number of in vitro and animal studies point toward an inhibitory effect of NSAIDs on bone healing process, the few existing retro- and prospective clinical studies present conflicting data. DESIGN: The aim of this qualitative, systematic review was to investigate the impact of perioperative use of NSAIDs in humans on postoperative fracture/spinal fusion healing compared to other used analgesics measured as fracture nonunion with radiological control. PATIENTS/INTERVENTIONS: We performed a systematic literature search of the last 38 years using PubMed Embase and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register including retro- and prospective clinical, human trials assessing the effect of NSAIDs on postoperative fracture/spinal fusion healing when used for perioperative pain management with a radiological follow up to assess eventual nonunion. Due to different study designs, drugs, dosages/exposition times and different methods to assess fracture nonunion, these studies were not pooled for a meta-analysis. A descriptive summary of all studies, level of evidence, study quality and study bias assessment using different scores were used. MAIN RESULTS: Three prospective randomized controlled studies and thirteen retrospective cohort human studies were identified for a total of 12'895 patients. The overall study quality was low according to Jadad and Oxford Levels of Evidence scores. CONCLUSIONS: Published results of human trials did not show strong evidence that NDAIDs for pain therapy after fracture osteosynthesis or spinal fusion lead to an increased nonunion rate. Reviewed studies present such conflicting data, that no clinical recommendation can be made regarding the appropriate use of NSAIDs in this context. Considering laboratory data of animal, human tissue research and recommendation of clinical reviews, a short perioperative exposition to NSAIDs is most likely not deleterious. However, randomized, controlled studies are warranted to support or refute this hypothesis.},

Animal-assisted interventions (AAIs), including interventions involving dog visiting, are increasingly recognized as an innovative approach to ameliorate social, behavioral, psychological, and physical outcomes among older adults. However, available data on their potential to manage depressive symptoms in the aging population are not clear cut. The aim of this review was to conduct a meta-analysis of all prospective controlled studies evaluating the effects of dog visiting on depressive symptoms in older adults. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted on the electronic databases PubMed and Scopus. Included articles were published between 1980 and 2017 and report controlled empirical studies of dog visiting interventions to ameliorate depressive symptoms in older adults. RESULTS: There was substantial heterogeneity between included studies, which varied in their methodological quality, sample size, and other key features. Notwithstanding such methodological variety, results all go in the same direction and indicate a large beneficial effect of interventions involving dog visiting on depressive symptoms. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: This analysis confirms the potential value of dog visiting in ameliorating depressive symptoms in institutionalized and noninstitutionalized older adults. This is in line with previous research indicating AAIs as promising complementary programs for preserving/enhancing emotional and behavioral function in aged individuals. More research is still needed to allow AAIs to be effectively introduced in clinical practice.},

Our research group recently performed a systematic review of reported cell-based-enriching methods for recellularization of ANAs. Recellularization results in consistent improvement of peripheral neuroregeneration compared with plain ANAs. We systematically reviewed the effects on nerve regeneration when ANA enrichment was obtained through biological, chemical, and physical modification instead of cells. METHODS: The PubMed, ScienceDirect, Medline, and Scopus databases were searched for reports of noncellular modification of ANAs, reported from January 2007 to December 2017. The inclusion criteria were English language, noncellular enrichment of ANAs in peripheral nerve regeneration, an in vivo study design, and postgrafting neuroregenerative outcomes assessment. The exclusion criteria were the central nervous system as the site of ANA application, nerve conduits, xenografts, case series, case reports, and reviews. RESULTS: Only animal studies were found to be eligible. We included 16 studies, which were analyzed regarding the animal model, decellularization method, graft-enriching mode, and neuroregenerative tests performed. CONCLUSIONS: Noncellular-based stimulation of ANAs demonstrated positive effects on recovery of nerve function compared with nerve grafting compared with plain ANAs. The neuroregenerative effect of autografting still appeared superior to ANAs, even with noncellular enrichment of ANAs. However, we found that in a few studies, modified ANAs closely approached or even outperformed autografts. Future research should include more preclinical investigations of this promising tool and clinical translation to increase the level of evidence available in the challenging field of peripheral nerve reconstruction.},

Comparative analyses using bioinformatic methods and Omics-based technologies allow insights into how these human pathogens have emerged and their potential for host cross-species transmission. Systematic review of literature published across ProQuest, Pubmed, and Web of Science databases for evidence of adenoviral zoonotic potential identified 589 citations. After removing duplicates, 327 citations were screened for relevance; of which, 74 articles received full-text reviews. Among these, 24 were included here, of which 16 demonstrated evidence of zoonotic transmission of AdVs. These documented instances of AdV crossing host species barriers between humans and non-human primate, bat, feline, swine, canine, ovine, and caprine. Eight studies sought to but did not find evidence of zoonosis. The findings demonstrate substantial evidence suggesting AdVs have previously and will continue crossing host species barriers. These have human health consequences both in terms of novel pathogen emergence and epidemic outbreaks, and of appropriate and safe use of non-human adenoviruses for therapeutics. As routine human clinical diagnostics may miss a novel cross-species adenovirus infection in humans, next generation sequencing or panspecies molecular diagnostics may be necessary to detect such incursions.},

We set out to define the most important characteristics that define the degree of cardiac remodeling in this model. A systematic review and meta-analyses were performed on studies using the TAC mouse/rat model and reporting echocardiographic outcome parameters. We included all animal studies in which a constriction around the transverse aorta and at least one of the predefined echocardiography or MRI outcome parameters were assessed. A total of 502 articles and {\textgreater} 3000 wild-type, untreated animals undergoing TAC were included in this study and referenced to a control group. The duration of aortic constriction correlated to the degree of adverse remodeling. However, the mouse data is strongly biased by the preferential use of male C57Bl/6 mice (66\% of studies). Furthermore, mostly ketamine/xylazine anesthetics, 27G needle constriction, and silk sutures are used. Nonetheless, despite the homogeneity in experimental design, the model contained a substantial degree of heterogeneity in the functional outcome measures. When looking at study quality, only 12\% reported randomization, 23\% mentioned any sort of blinding, 25\% adequately addressed the outcomes, and an amazingly low percentage (2\%) showed sample size calculation. Meta-analyses did not detect specific study characteristics that explained the heterogeneity in the reported outcome measures, however this might be related to the strong bias towards the use of specific mouse lines, sex as well as age or to poor reporting of characteristics of study quality.},

	abstract = {To investigate the relationship between faecal calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) excretion in different mammalian species, a meta-analysis on digestibility data derived from the literature was conducted. Seventy-three studies on carnivores, omnivores, large and small hindgut fermenters, ruminants and hippos (a total of 21 mammalian species, precondition for inclusion dietary Ca/P ratio 1.5/1 - 3.0/1) were analysed for Ca and P digestibility. Dietary Ca/P ratios were lower than faecal Ca/P ratios in carnivores, omnivores, ruminants and hippos. In hindgut fermenters, dietary Ca/P ratios were higher than faecal Ca/P ratios, indicating higher intestinal Ca absorption in these species. In all species investigated, there was a significant positive relationship between Ca intake and faecal Ca excretion and between P intake and faecal P excretion. In the biologically relevant range, these equations predicted lower faecal Ca losses in hindgut fermenters than ruminants, for faecal P vice versa. In all species, faecal Ca and P excretion correlated significantly. In carnivores, this highly linear correlation was exceptionally strong (R² = .92). Yet, the linearity of the correlation was questionable in omnivores and ruminants. Possibly, the strong linear correlation of faecal Ca and P excretion in carnivores is due to the formation of insoluble Ca/P complexes in their relatively short and simple gastrointestinal tract. Another hypothesis is that in carnivores, Ca homeostasis relies on modifying bone turnover to a higher degree than on changes in intestinal Ca absorption. For the formation of bone matrix, a constant ratio of Ca and P absorption is of advantage.},

Multiple keywords such as "raw cow milk, heavy metals, and human health" were used to search in related databases. A total of 60 original articles published since 2010 reporting the levels of these metals in raw cow's milk across the world were reviewed. Data showed that the highest levels of Ni (833 mg/L), Pb (60 mg/L), Cu (36 mg/L) were noticed in raw cow milk collected in area consists of granites and granite gneisses in India, while the highest level of Cd (12 mg/L) was reported in barite mining area in India. Fe values in raw cow milk samples were above the WHO maximum limit (0.37 mg/L) with highest values (37.02 mg/L) recorded in India. The highest Al level was (22.50 mg/L) reported for raw cow's milk collected close to food producing plants region in Turkey. The Target Hazard Quotients (THQ) values of Hg were below 1 suggesting that milk consumers are not at a non-carcinogenic risk except in Faisalabad province (Pakistan) where THQ values = 7.7. For the other heavy metals, the THQ values were {\textgreater}1 for Pb (10 regions out of 70), for Cd (6 regions out of 59), for Ni (3 out of 29), and for Cu (3 out of 54). Exposure to heavy metals is positively associated with diseases developments. Moreover, data actualization and continuous monitoring are necessary and recommended to evaluate heavy metals effects in future studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cryptosporidium infection causes gastrointestinal disease and has a worldwide distribution. The highest burden is in developing countries. OBJECTIVES: We sought to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify Cryptosporidium risk factors in Low and Middle Income countries (LMICs). METHODS: Medline Ovid and Scopus databases were searched with no restriction on year or language of publication. All references were screened independently in duplicate and were included if they presented data on at least 3 risk factors. Meta-analyses using random effects models were used to calculate overall estimates for each exposure. RESULTS: The most frequently reported risk factors in the 15 included studies were overcrowding, household diarrhoea, poor quality drinking water, animal contact, open defecation/ lack of toilet and breastfeeding. The combined odds ratio for animal contact was 1.98 (95\%CI: 1.11-3.54) based on 11 studies and for diarrhoea in the household 1.98 (95\%CI: 1.13-3.49) based on 4 studies. Open defecation was associated with a pooled odds ratio of 1.82 (95\%CI: 1.19-2.8) based on 5 studies. Poor drinking water quality was not associated with a significant Cryptosporidium risk, odds ratio 1.06 (95\%CI: 0.77-1.47). Breastfeeding was protective with pooled odds ratio 0.4 (95\%CI: 0.13-1.22), which was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the included studies, crowded living conditions, animal contact and open defecation are responsible for the majority of Cryptosporidium cases in LMICs. Future studies investigating Cryptosporidium risk factors should have a good study design and duration, include appropriate number of cases, select suitable controls, investigate multiple relevant risk factors, fully report data and perform multivariate analysis.},

Consequently, a One Health approach to disease surveillance and control has generated much interest across several disciplines. This systematic review evaluates current global research on the use of domestic dogs as sentinels for human infectious disease, and critically appraises how this may be applied within Canada. Results highlighted a bias in research from high- and middle-income-economy countries, with 35\% of the studies describing data from the Latin America/Caribbean region, 25\% from North America, and 11\% from the European/Central Asia region. Bacteria were the most studied type of infectious agent, followed by protozoa, viruses, helminths, and fungi. Only six out of 142 studies described disease in Canada: four researched a variety of pathogens within Indigenous communities, one researched Borrelia burgdorferi in British Columbia, and one researched arboviruses in Quebec. Results from this review suggest that dogs could provide excellent sentinels for certain infectious-disease pathogens in Canada, yet are currently overlooked. Further research into the use of dog-sentinel surveillance is specifically recommended for California serogroup viruses, Chikungunya virus, West Nile virus, Lyme borreliosis, Rickettsia spp., Ehrlichia spp., and Dirofilaria immitis.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The distribution of Taenia saginata in the Americas is unclear. Establishing the distribution, economic burden, and potentials for control of bovine cysticercosis is increasingly important due to the growing demand for beef. This paper aims to take the first step and reviews the recent distribution of T. saginata taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis on a national level within the Americas. METHODS: We undertook a systematic review of published and grey literature for information on the occurrence, prevalence, and geographical distribution of bovine cysticercosis and human taeniosis in the 54 countries and territories of the Americas between January 1st, 1990 and December 31st, 2017. Data on bovine cysticercosis from OIE reports from 1994 to 2005 were also included. RESULTS: We identified 66 papers from the Americas with data on the occurrence of taeniosis or bovine cysticercosis and an additional 19 OIE country reports on bovine cysticercosis. Taeniosis was reported from 13 countries, with nine of these countries reporting specifically T. saginata taeniosis, and four countries reporting non-species specific taeniosis. The reported prevalence of taeniosis ranged between 0.04-8.8\%. Bovine cysticercosis was reported from 19 countries, nine identified through the literature search, and an additional 10 identified through the OIE country reports for notifiable diseases. The reported prevalence of bovine cysticercosis ranged between 0.1-19\%. Disease occurrence was restricted to 21 countries within the Americas, the majority from the mainland, with the only island nations reporting either bovine cysticercosis or taeniosis being Cuba, Haiti, and the US Virgin Islands. CONCLUSIONS: Taenia saginata is widely distributed across 21 of the 54 countries in the Americas, but insufficient epidemiological data are available to estimate the subnational spatial distribution, prevalence, incidence and intensity of infections. This needs to be addressed through active surveillance and disease detection programmes. Such programmes would improve the data quantity and quality, and may enable estimation of the economic burden due to bovine cysticercosis in the region in turn determining the requirement for and cost-effectiveness of control measures.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Working dogs are selected based on predictions from tests that they will be able to perform specific tasks in often challenging environments. However, withdrawal from service in working dogs is still a big problem, bringing into question the reliability of the selection tests used to make these predictions. METHODS: A systematic review was undertaken aimed at bringing together available information on the reliability and predictive validity of the assessment of behavioural characteristics used with working dogs to establish the quality of selection tests currently available for use to predict success in working dogs. RESULTS: The search procedures resulted in 16 papers meeting the criteria for inclusion. A large range of behaviour tests and parameters were used in the identified papers, and so behaviour tests and their underpinning constructs were grouped on the basis of their relationship with positive core affect (willingness to work, human-directed social behaviour, object-directed play tendencies) and negative core affect (human-directed aggression, approach withdrawal tendencies, sensitivity to aversives). We then examined the papers for reports of inter-rater reliability, within-session intra-rater reliability, test-retest validity and predictive validity. CONCLUSIONS: The review revealed a widespread lack of information relating to the reliability and validity of measures to assess behaviour and inconsistencies in terminologies, study parameters and indices of success. There is a need to standardise the reporting of these aspects of behavioural tests in order to improve the knowledge base of what characteristics are predictive of optimal performance in working dog roles, improving selection processes and reducing working dog redundancy. We suggest the use of a framework based on explaining the direct or indirect relationship of the test with core affect.},

We undertook an updated synthesis and meta-analyses on key outcomes for the treatment of calves with HFG. Evaluated outcomes were oocyst shedding, diarrhoea, mortality and weight gain. Experiments had to describe results for same age animals in contemporary arms. Most doses were 100-150 mcg kg-1 day-1. Results were subgrouped by study design, experiments with the lowest risk of bias and lack of industry funding. Eighteen articles were found that described 25 experiments. Most evidence came from randomized controlled trials in Europe. Significantly lower incidence of oocyst shedding, diarrhoea burden and mortality was reported when treatment started before calves were 5 days old. Most studies reported on outcomes for animals up to at least 28 days old. Publication bias was possible in all outcomes and seemed especially likely for diarrhoea outcomes. Beneficial results when HFG treatment was initiated in calves older than 5 days were also found. Prophylactic treatment to prevent cryptosporidiosis is effective in preventing multiple negative outcomes and is beneficial to calf health and will result in a reduction of environmental contamination by Cryptosporidium oocysts.},

No vaccine or cure exists, although symptomatic onset may be delayed with some chemoprophylactics. Other response and management strategies have focused on nutritional status, cleanliness and biosecurity. We undertook a systematic review of observational studies to identify risk or protective factors that could prevent Cryptosporidium parvum infection in calves. Included studies used multivariate analysis within cohort, cross-sectional or case-control designs, of risk factors among young calves, assessing C. parvum specifically. We tabulated data on characteristics and study quality and present narrative synthesis. Fourteen eligible studies were found; three of which were higher quality. The most consistent evidence suggested that risk of C. parvum infection increased when calves had more contact with other calves, were in larger herds or in organic production. Hard flooring reduced risk of infection and calves tended to have more cryptosporidiosis during warm and wet weather. While many other factors were not found to be associated with C. parvum infection, analyses were usually badly underpowered, due to clustering of management factors. Trials are needed to assess effects of manipulating calf contact, herd size, organic methods, hard flooring and temperature. Other factors need to be assessed in larger observational studies with improved disaggregation of potential risk factors.},

DESIGN: The protocols for systematic review were all developed, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses statement and applied to animal research. Reporting of In vivo experiment guidelines for reporting animal research to assess the risk of bias of the studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE through PubMed and manual search from the reference lists of main articles related to the theme. RESULTS: This search strategy identified 65 references, of which 33 were considered inappropriate. The full texts of 32 articles were read, 31 of which did not meet the eligibility criteria and were excluded. The final selection included 1 article for which data was extracted for further evaluation. The article included shows a strongest reaction in the periodontium in front of a secondary occlusal trauma as inflammation and apical migration of the junctional epithelium, bone degradation, and decrease in the quantity of collagen fiber. However, primary occlusal trauma also presents these alterations, with the exception of apical migration of the junctional epithelium. CONCLUSIONS: Although only one study was included in the systematic review of traumatic occlusion, there is some evidence from experimental studies on animals that shows a coherent picture of the effects of traumatic occlusion on the periodontium. However, new studies are needed to fully answer the questions posed by this systematic review.},

There is growing evidence that supports that the use of probiotics is effective against various diseases, especially in gastrointestinal diseases, including the colorectal cancer, but the differences between the strains, dose, and frequency used are not yet clear. AIMS: To perform a systematic review to compile the results of studies carried out in animal models and investigated the effect of probiotics on colorectal carcinogenesis. METHODS: Studies were selected in PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Search filters were developed using three parameters: probiotics, colorectal cancer, and animal model. RESULTS: From a structured search, we discovered 34 original articles and submitted them to a risk of bias analysis using SYRCLE's tool. The studies show a great diversity of models, most were conducted in rats (55.8\%) and used 1,2 dimethylhydrazine as the drug to induce colorectal carcinogenesis (61.7\%). The vast majority of trials investigated Lactobacillus (64\%) and Bifidobacterium (29.4\%) strains. Twenty-six (86.6\%) studies found significant reduction in lesions or tumors in the animals that received probiotics. The main methodological limitation was the insufficient amount of information for the adequate reproducibility of the trials, which indicated a high risk of bias due to incomplete characterization of the experimental design. CONCLUSIONS: The different probiotics' strains showed anti-carcinogenic effect, reduced the development of lesions and intestinal tumors, antioxidant and immunomodulatory activity, and reduced fecal bacterial enzymes.},

	abstract = {Bone defects following trauma represent a high impact on the quality of life of millions of people around the world. The aim of this study was to review photobiomodulation (PBM) action in the treatment of bone critical defects in rat calvaria, related to evaluation of the current protocols applied. One hundred and forty-seven articles related to the subject were found by searching the main databases (Pubmed, Lilacs, Web of Science, and Scopus) considering the period of publication until the year 2017, and only 14 corresponded the inclusion criteria established for this systematic review. The main parameters of the PBM were expressed in Table 1. In addition, it was possible to observe the use of two different wavelengths (red and infrared), which are considered therapeutic. Most of the evaluated articles presented positive results that describe a greater amount of neoformed bone, an increase in collagen synthesis, and a contribution to microvascular reestablishment. However, two studies report no effect on the repair process when the PBM was used. In addition, we observed considerable variations between the values of power, fluence, and total energy, which make it difficult to compare the results presented between the selected studies. It was possible to conclude that the infrared laser was more effective in positively stimulating the bone repair process of critical defects. Furthermore, a discrepancy was found in the parameter values used, which made it difficult to choose the best protocol for the treatment of this type of lesion.},

	abstract = {Burn is defined as a traumatic injury of thermal origin, which affects the organic tissue. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has gained great prominence as a treatment in this type of injury; however, the application parameters are still controversial in the literature. The aims of this study were to review the literature studies that use LLLT as a treatment in burns conducted in an experimental model, discuss the main parameters used, and highlight the benefits found in order to choose an appropriate therapeutic window to be applied in this type of injury. The selection of the studies related to the theme was carried out in the main databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, LILACS, Web of Science, and Scopus in the period from 2001 to 2017). Subsequently, the articles were then chosen that fell within the inclusion criteria previously established. In the end, 22 were evaluated, and the main parameters were presented. The analyzed studies presented both LLLT use in continuous and pulsed mode. Differences between the parameters used (power, fluence, and total energy) were observed. In addition, the protocols are distinct as to the type of injury and the number of treatment sessions. Among the results obtained by the authors are the improvements in the local microcirculation and cellular proliferation; however, a study reported no effects with LLLT as a treatment. LLLT is effective in accelerating the healing process. However, there is immense difficulty in establishing the most adequate protocol, due to the great discrepancy found in the applied dosimetry values.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is one of the most disabling neglected tropical diseases, ranking second in terms of years lived with disability. While treatment with the drug praziquantel can have immediate beneficial effects, reinfection can occur rapidly if people are in contact with cercaria-infested water. Water treatment for schistosomiasis control seeks to eliminate viable cercariae from water, thereby providing safe alternative water supplies for recreational and domestic activities including laundry and bathing. This provision may reduce contact with infested water, which is crucial for reducing reinfection following chemotherapy and cutting schistosome transmission. METHODOLOGY: A qualitative systematic review was carried out to summarize the existing knowledge on the effectiveness of water treatment in removing or inactivating human schistosome cercariae. Four online databases were searched. Studies were screened and categorized into five water treatment processes: storage, heating, chlorination, filtration, and ultraviolet (UV) disinfection. CONCLUSIONS: All five water treatment methods can remove or inactivate cercariae in water, and hence produce cercaria-free water. However, reliable design guidelines for treating water do not exist as there are insufficient data. Overall, the review found that cercariae are inactivated when storing water for 10-72 hours (depending on temperature), or with chlorination values of 3-30 mg-min/l. UV fluences between 3-60 mJ/cm2 may significantly damage or kill cercariae, and sand filters with 0.18-0.35 mm grain size have been shown to remove cercariae. This systematic review identified 67 studies about water treatment and schistosomiasis published in the past 106 years. It highlights the many factors that influence the results of water treatment experiments, which include different water quality conditions and methods for measuring key parameters. Variation in these factors limit comparability, and therefore currently available information is insufficient for providing complete water treatment design recommendations.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Recurrence after pituitary surgery in Cushing's disease (CD) is a common problem ranging from 5\% (minimum) to 50\% (maximum) after initially successful surgery, respectively. In this review, we give an overview of the current literature regarding prevalence, diagnosis, and therapeutic options of recurrent CD. METHODS: We systematically screened the literature regarding recurrent and persistent Cushing's disease using the MESH term Cushing's disease and recurrence. Of 717 results in PubMed, all manuscripts in English and German published between 1980 and April 2020 were screened. Case reports, comments, publications focusing on pediatric CD or CD in veterinary disciplines or studies with very small sample size (patient number {\textless} 10) were excluded. Also, papers on CD in pregnancy were not included in this review. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Because of the high incidence of recurrence in CD, annual clinical and biochemical follow-up is paramount. 50\% of recurrences occur during the first 50 months after first surgery. In case of recurrence, treatment options include second surgery, pituitary radiation, targeted medical therapy to control hypercortisolism, and bilateral adrenalectomy. Success rates of all these treatment options vary between 25 (some of the medical therapy) and 100\% (bilateral adrenalectomy). All treatment options have specific advantages, limitations, and side effects. Therefore, treatment decisions have to be individualized according to the specific needs of the patient.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Several different animal models are used to study disuse-induced bone loss. This systematic review aims to give a comprehensive overview of the animal models of disuse-induced bone loss and provide a detailed narrative synthesis of each unique animal model. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were systematically searched for animal models of disuse from inception to November 30, 2019. In addition, Google Scholar and personal file archives were searched for relevant publications not indexed in PubMed or Embase. Two reviewers independently reviewed titles and abstracts for full-text inclusion. Data were extracted using a predefined extraction scheme to ensure standardization. RESULTS: 1964 titles and abstracts were screened of which 653 full-text articles were included. The most common animal species used to model disuse were rats (59\%) and mice (30\%). Males (53\%) where used in the majority of the studies and genetically modified animals accounted for 7\%. Twelve different methods to induce disuse were identified. The most frequently used methods were hindlimb unloading (44\%), neurectomy (15\%), bandages and orthoses (15\%), and botulinum toxin (9\%). The median time of disuse was 21 days (quartiles: 14 days, 36 days) and the median number of animals per group subjected to disuse was 10 (quartiles: 7, 14). Random group allocation was reported in 43\% of the studies. Fewer than 5\% of the studies justified the number of animals per group by a sample size calculation to ensure adequate statistical power. CONCLUSION: Multiple animal models of disuse-induced bone loss exist, and several species of animals have successfully been studied. The complexity of disuse-induced bone loss warrants rigid research study designs. This systematic review emphasized the need for standardization of animal disuse research and reporting.},

	abstract = {Currently, the deployment of tracking devices is one of the most frequently used approaches to study movement ecology of birds. Recent miniaturization of light-level geolocators enabled studying small bird species whose migratory patterns were widely unknown. However, geolocators may reduce vital rates in tagged birds and may bias obtained movement data. There is a need for a thorough assessment of the potential tag effects on small birds, as previous meta-analyses did not evaluate unpublished data and impact of multiple life-history traits, focused mainly on large species and the number of published studies tagging small birds has increased substantially. We quantitatively reviewed 549 records extracted from 74 published and 48 unpublished studies on over 7,800 tagged and 17,800 control individuals to examine the effects of geolocator tagging on small bird species (body mass {\textless}100 g). We calculated the effect of tagging on apparent survival, condition, phenology and breeding performance and identified the most important predictors of the magnitude of effect sizes. Even though the effects were not statistically significant in phylogenetically controlled models, we found a weak negative impact of geolocators on apparent survival. The negative effect on apparent survival was stronger with increasing relative load of the device and with geolocators attached using elastic harnesses. Moreover, tagging effects were stronger in smaller species. In conclusion, we found a weak effect on apparent survival of tagged birds and managed to pinpoint key aspects and drivers of tagging effects. We provide recommendations for establishing matched control group for proper effect size assessment in future studies and outline various aspects of tagging that need further investigation. Finally, our results encourage further use of geolocators on small bird species but the ethical aspects and scientific benefits should always be considered.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer is the third most common form of cancer and colorectal surgery is the treatment of choice in local disease. Anastomotic leakage following colorectal surgery is a major complication with a high incidence and mortality. Adjuvant hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) may be associated with reduction of anastomotic leakage. A systematic review was conducted regarding HBOT as an adjunctive therapy to colorectal surgery. METHODS: Systematic review (1900-2017) using PubMed, Cochrane, EMBASE, Web of Science and EMCARE. All original published studies on the effect of HBOT as an adjunctive therapy for colorectal surgery with the creation of an anastomosis were considered. RESULTS: Thirteen small animal trials were included for qualitative synthesis. We found no human trials. Eleven trials used bursting pressure whilst eight used hydroxyproline levels as a marker for collagen synthesis as primary outcome to assess the strength of the anastomosis. A meta-analysis performed for normal and ischaemic anastomoses showed that postoperative HBOT improves bursting pressure and hydroxyproline levels significantly in both normal (p ≤ 0.001 and p = 0.02) and ischaemic anastomoses (p ≤ 0.001 and p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Postoperative HBOT has a positive effect on colorectal anastomoses in rats. Further research should focus on a larger systematic animal study.},

	abstract = {As training in microvascular surgery often involves the use of live animals, it is important that such a practice is regularly revisited and justified, particularly in the context of emerging training strategies such as virtual simulation. This systematic review was therefore designed to assess the ongoing need for their use over other methods. A search of PubMed and MEDLINE using the major MeSH terms: anastomosis, surgical vascular procedures, microsurgery, and training, yielded 1386 titles from which 153 abstracts were read, 70 papers analysed, and 17 included. Nine of these papers were randomised studies that compared different methods of training. Other publications were included if the use of live animals was assessed or commented upon, or both (8 publications). Only one study randomised trainees to a non-living animal model or a living model, with detailed assessment that included clinical transfer to live surgery. It showed no significant difference in the quality of training, and excellent techniques of assessment. There was much discussion on the advantage of regular training and opportunities to practise without tuition, but there was no clear advantage for the use of live animals. Our review emphasises the lack of evidence regarding the need for live animals in the training of microsurgical or microvascular skills. Although the assumption remains that the use of live rats is essential, there is a clear need for a high-quality, comparative study to justify the continued use of such models given the quality of the alternatives now available.},

	abstract = {Periodontitis is one of the most prevalent inflammatory diseases. Its treatment, mostly mechanical and non-surgical, shows limitations. The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the effect of nanoparticles as a treatment alone in non-surgical periodontal therapy in animal models. A systematic search was conducted in Medline/PubMed, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library and Science Direct. The eligibility criteria were: studies (i) using nanoparticles as chemotherapeutic agent or as delivery system; (ii) including preclinical controlled animal model (experimental periodontitis); (iii) reporting alveolar bone loss; (iv) written in English; and (v) published up to June 2019. Risk of bias was evaluated according to the SYstematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation. On the 1324 eligible studies, 11 were included. All reported advantages in using nanoparticles for the treatment of periodontitis, highlighted by a reduction in bone loss. Agents modulating inflammation seem to be more relevant than antibiotics, in terms of efficiency and risk of antibiotic resistance. In addition, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) or drugs used as their own carrier appear to be the most interesting nanoparticles in terms of biocompatibility. Risk of bias assessment highlighted many criteria scored as unclear. There are encouraging preclinical data of using nanoparticles as a contribution to the treatment of periodontitis.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Treatment of acute organophosphorus or carbamate insecticide self-poisoning is often ineffective, with tens of thousands of deaths occurring every year. Researchers have recommended the addition of magnesium sulfate or calcium channel blocking drugs to standard care to reduce acetylcholine release at cholinergic synapses. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to review systematically the evidence from preclinical studies in animals exposed to organophosphorus or carbamate insecticides concerning the efficacy of magnesium sulfate and calcium channel blocking drugs as therapy compared with placebo in reducing mortality or clinical features of poisoning. We also systematically reviewed the evidence from clinical studies in patients self-poisoned with organophosphorus or carbamate insecticides concerning the efficacy of magnesium sulfate and calcium channel blocking drugs as therapy compared with placebo, in addition to standard therapy, in reducing mortality, atropine requirement, need for intubation and ventilation, and intensive care unit and hospital stay. METHODS: We performed a systematic review for articles on magnesium sulfate and calcium channel blocking drugs in organophosphorus or carbamate insecticide poisoning using PubMed and China Academic Journals Full-text (Medicine/Hygiene Series) databases and keywords: "organophosphorus or organophosphate poisoning", "cholinesterase inhibitor poisoning" OR "carbamate poisoning" AND "magnesium", "calcium channel blocker", or generic names of different calcium channel blocking drugs. Review of titles and abstracts revealed 2262 papers of potential relevance. After review of the full papers, a total of 19 papers relevant to the question were identified: five preclinical studies, nine case reports or small case series, and five clinical studies and trials. We also obtained primary data from three unpublished clinical trials of magnesium sulfate, providing data from a total of eight clinical studies and trials for analysis. All studies were of organophosphorus insecticides; no studies of carbamates were found. No pre-clinical or clinical studies of calcium channel blocking drugs and magnesium sulfate in combination were found. We extracted data on study type, treatment regimens, outcome, and side effects. Pre-clinical studies: Two rodent studies indicated a benefit of calcium channel blocking drugs treatment on mortality if given before or soon after organophosphorus exposure, in addition to atropine and/or oxime. In poisoned minipigs, treatment with magnesium sulfate after organophosphorus insecticide poisoning reduced cholinergic stimulation and hypertension. Of note, magnesium sulfate further suppressed serum butyrylcholinesterase activity in one rat study. Observational clinical studies: Calcium channel blocking drugs and magnesium sulfate have been used to treat cardiac dysrhythmias and hypertonic uterine contractions in organophosphorus poisoned patients. A small neurophysiological study of magnesium sulfate reported reversion of neuromuscular junction effects of organophosphorus insecticide exposure. Comparative clinical studies: Only four of eight studies were randomized controlled trials; all studies were of magnesium sulfate, of small to modest size, and at substantial risk of bias. They included 441 patients, with 239 patients receiving magnesium sulfate and 202 control patients. The pooled odds ratios for magnesium sulfate for mortality and need for intubation and ventilation for all eight studies were 0.55 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.32-0.94) and 0.52 (95\% CI 0.34-0.79), respectively. However, there was heterogeneity in the results of higher quality phase III randomized controlled trials providing more conservative estimates. Although a small dose-escalation study suggested benefit from higher doses of magnesium sulfate, there was no evidence of a dose effect across the studies. Adverse effects were reported rarely, with 11.1\% of patients in the randomized controlled trials receiving the highest dose of magnesium sulfate requiring their infusion to be stopped due to hypotension. CONCLUSIONS: Both preclinical and clinical data suggest that magnesium sulfate and calcium channel blocking drugs might be promising adjunct treatments for acute organophosphorus insecticide poisoning. However, evidence is currently insufficient to recommend their use. Mechanistic and large multi-center randomized controlled trials testing calcium channel blocking drugs and magnesium sulfate are required to provide the necessary evidence, with careful identification of the insecticides ingested and measurement of surrogate markers of toxicity, including butyrylcholinesterase activity.},

	abstract = {Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is one of the most common calfhood diseases in dairy cattle. Unfortunately, published data on the short- and long-term effects of calfhood BRD on health and performance are scarce and, when available, often conflicting and uncertain. The objective of this study was therefore to review the scientific literature on the effects of calfhood BRD on health and performance of dairy cattle and summarize the research findings using a meta-analysis approach. The systematic review and meta-analysis were performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed and CAB Abstract databases were screened for relevant studies that were published in English (until February 3, 2020). Only studies reporting naturally occurring BRD cases from birth to 12 mo of age in dairy calves in Europe and North America were considered eligible. Both observational studies and randomized controlled trials were included. Random-effect meta-analysis models were used to quantify the effect of BRD on outcomes for which at least 5 studies reported a numeric estimation of the effect of BRD. From an initial pool of 525 references, 27 full-text articles with original data were included in the manuscript. Meta-analysis models were prepared for 4 outcomes: odds of mortality (n = 7 studies), odds of herd removal before first calving (n = 5 studies), average daily gain (n = 10 studies), and milk production during first lactation (n = 5 studies). In these models, heifers diagnosed with BRD during calfhood had 2.85 times higher odds of dying (95\% confidence interval: 1.22 to 6.69) and 2.30 times higher odds of herd removal (i.e., dead, culled, or sold) before the first calving (95\% confidence interval: 1.75 to 3.03) compared with heifers not diagnosed with this condition. Heifers experiencing calfhood BRD also had an average daily gain reduced by 0.067 kg/d (95\% confidence interval: -0.099 to -0.034) and they produced 121.2 kg (95\% confidence interval: -184.9 to -57.5) less milk during their first lactation. Other health and performance outcomes, such as age at first calving and odds of not finishing the first lactation, were also investigated but not summarized using a meta-analysis approach. Pooled estimates obtained in the present study may provide more accurate estimates of the overall economic losses associated with calfhood BRD in dairy cattle.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is used in various areas including veterinary medicine. The assessment of the quality of systematic review and meta-analyses (SR-MA) despite their importance in the EBM process is uncommonly performed in veterinary medicine due to the absence of specific dedicated tools. The main objective of this observational study was to examine the extent and nature of SR-MA that can be available online to an equine or bovine veterinarian. Secondary objectives included: (1) to determine if A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool can be used for equine and bovine SR-MA methodological assessment and if it has a satisfactory interrater reliability in a subsample of these SR-MA and (2) to appraise the completeness of abstract reporting of this sample. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A scoping review using equine and bovine medical science SR-MA retrieved from PubMed was performed. A sub-sample of these reviews (n = 30) were independently assessed by 3 different raters using the AMSTAR tool validated for medical reviews. The completeness of abstract reporting was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. RESULTS: Ten and 168 SR-MA were retrieved for equine and bovine species respectively. For bovine SR-MA, 93 reviews were about nutrition and metabolism topic. On the 30 SR-MA subsamples, with 10 equine and 20 bovine SR-MA randomly chosen for AMSTAR assessment, the median interrater agreement (Kappa) was 0.60 (interquartile range: 0.36-0.71) depending on AMSTAR item and pairs of raters. When focusing on the total score of AMSTAR, the inter-observer intra-class correlation coefficient was very good (0.85, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.74-0.92). The AMSTAR items that were unfrequently reported (33\% or less of reviews) were "a priori" protocol of SR-MA specification, complete report of the list of studies (included and excluded studies), quality assessment of the included studies, publication bias assessment and conflict of interest (reported either for included studies and for SR-MA authors). Abstracts reporting quality was low with a median percentage of complete reported items of 33\% (range: 8-58\%) CONCLUSIONS: In large animal veterinary medicine, SR-MA are uncommonly performed in equine and bovine medicine. The SR-MA can be assessed using AMSTAR with acceptable inter-rater reliability, which is helpful to assess SR-MA methodological quality.},

IgG can also be measured indirectly by methods such as serum refractometry (REF) or Brix refractometry (BRIX). OBJECTIVES: To determine the accuracy of REF and BRIX for assessment of inadequate transfer of passive immunity (ITPI) in calves. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies. METHODS: Databases (PubMed and CAB Abstract, Searchable Proceedings of Animal Science) and Google Scholar were searched for relevant studies. Studies were eligible if the accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of REF or BRIX was determined using direct measurement of IgG by RID or turbidimetry as the reference standard. The study population included calves {\textless}14 days old that were fed with natural colostrum (colostrum replacement products were excluded). Quality assessment was performed by the QUADAS-2 tool. Hierarchical models were used for meta-analysis. RESULTS: From 1,291 references identified, 13 studies of 3,788 calves were included. Of these, 11 studies evaluated REF and 5 studies evaluated BRIX. The median (range) prevalence of ITPI (defined as calves with IgG {\textless}10 g/L by RID or TIA) was 21\% (1.3-56\%). Risk of bias and applicability concerns were generally low or unclear. For REF, summary estimates were obtained for 2 different cutoffs: 5.2 g/dL (6 studies) and 5.5 g/dL (5 studies). For the 5.2 g/dL cutoff, the summary sensitivity (95\% CI) and specificity (95\% CI) were 76.1\% (63.8-85.2\%) and 89.3\% (82.3-93.7\%), and 88.2\% (80.2-93.3\%) and 77.9\% (74.5-81.0\%) for the 5.5 g/dL cutoff. Due to the low number of studies using the same cutoffs, summary estimates could not be obtained for BRIX. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Despite their widespread use on dairy farms, evidence about the optimal strategy for using refractometry, including the optimal cutoff, are sparse (especially for BRIX). When using REF to rule out ITPI in herds, the 5.5 g/dL cutoff may be used whereas for ruling in ITPI, the 5.2 g/dL cutoff may be used.},

	abstract = {Inadequate transfer of passive immunity (TPI) is associated with increased risk for calfhood disease and increased risk of mortality and morbidity. Accurately diagnosing calves and herds with inadequate TPI is of primary importance and brix (BRIX) or classical refractometer (REF) devices are more practical for this purpose than measuring the serum immunoglobulin G concentration in neonatal calves. We previously reported a systematic review and meta-analysis for quantifying the pooled accuracy of BRIX and REF for detecting calves with serum IgG {\textless} 10 g/L noting that sparse data were available especially because studies did not report the same thresholds. We updated the previous systematic review using different methods that accounted for the test results distribution in calves with or without inadequate TPI. With this approach, all reported cut-offs for a specific study are used in that Bayesian approach that quantifies how accuracy varied among all reported thresholds. Five new manuscripts were included, which represented 4 new studies since the initial study was performed. A total of 11 REF and 9 BRIX studies were available. The meta-analytic methods allowed reporting variation of the true and false positive rate across and among all reported cut-offs. Pooled points estimates (95 \% Bayesian credible intervals) for sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of REF {\textless} 5.5 g/L were 86.1 \% (68.5-97.9\%) and 76.2 \% (65.9-88.4\%) whereas BRIX {\textless} 8.4 \% was associated with Se of 91.6 \% (77.2-99.5\%) and Sp of 88.2 \% (65.4-99.8\%). Interestingly, the accuracy (Se + Sp-1) was generally higher for BRIX than for REF at the reported cut-offs. Besides the benefit of providing pooled estimates for all reported and unreported BRIX and REF thresholds, the general framework used in this study could potentially be used in many veterinary diagnostic tests studies that reported multiple thresholds accounting for potentially different tests distributions in population with and without the target condition.},

	abstract = {IACUCs serve a critical role in animal care and use programs, ensuring that institutions which use animals in research and teaching do so responsibly and humanely. This role is defined in part by federal regulations, policies, and guidelines that prescribe the establishment and function of these committees. Often, IACUC administrators are expected to evaluate IACUC performance to ensure that committees execute these functions effectively, and in a manner that is suitable to the institution. However, methods for IACUC performance evaluation have not been well described in the peer-reviewed literature. To address this deficit, we conducted a systematic review using MEDLINE to identify methods that have been used to assess IACUCs. The scope of this review was intentionally broad to capture evaluation methods used by other institutional committees with similar responsibilities in overseeing research conduct, including animal ethics committees (AECs), institutional biosafety committees (IBCs), and institutional review boards (IRBs). Over 100 publications that included empirical evaluation methods were identified, although only 17 evaluated IACUCs in the United States. A substantial number of the studies used qualitative methods, such as surveys or questionnaires, interviews, and observations. The IACUC functions and characteristics most often assessed in the 17 publications included components of the protocol review processes and committee membership. We compiled this information to offer IACUC administrators a source of methodologies that can be incorporated into quality improvement and IACUC performance evaluation efforts. We also suggest ways in which organizations may evaluate IACUCs using methods described in the literature for other types of committees.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A systematic review of published data to determine whether postoperative antibiotic use after tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) decreases infection rates. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: A broad bibliographic search was performed in three online databases through March 2020 for publications on postoperative antibiotic use after TPLO in dogs. Search terms included dog, canine, TPLO, tibial plateau leveling osteotomy, infection, antibiotic, and antimicrobial. Articles that met inclusion criteria were evaluated for level of evidence (LoE) by a modified Oxford Level of Evidence (mOLE) and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) classification and evaluation. RESULTS: Thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Effect of antibiotic use was the primary question in four studies. Among those, 50\% (2/4) were assigned a mOLE of 1b and a GRADE of moderate, while the other 50\% (2/4) were assigned a mOLE of 4b or 4c with a GRADE of low. The two studies with the highest LoE did not provide evidence of the benefit of antibiotic usage. Results of only one study provided evidence to support the use of postoperative antibiotics. The remaining nine studies provided evaluation of antibiotic use secondarily and were all assigned a low LoE. Among these, 78\% (7/9) provided evidence to support the use of postoperative antibiotics. CONCLUSION: We found little evidence to support the use of postoperative antibiotics to reduce the risk of surgical site infections in dogs after TPLO. The answer to this clinical question is complicated by the lack of prospective studies and inconsistent treatment protocols in the evaluated studies. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The clinical impact of postoperative antibiotic administration on infection rates after TPLO is uncertain.},

	abstract = {Point sources such as wastewater treatment plants and agricultural facilities may have a role in the dissemination of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARG). To analyse the evidence for increases in ARB in the natural environment associated with these point sources of ARB and ARG, we conducted a systematic review. We evaluated 5,247 records retrieved through database searches, including both studies that ascertained ARG and ARB outcomes. All studies were subjected to a screening process to assess relevance to the question and methodology to address our review question. A risk of bias assessment was conducted upon the final pool of studies included in the review. This article summarizes the evidence only for those studies with ARB outcomes (n=47). Thirty-five studies were at high (n=11) or at unclear (n=24) risk of bias in the estimation of source effects due to lack of information and/or failure to control for confounders. Statistical analysis was used in ten studies, of which one assessed the effect of multiple sources using modelling approaches; none reported effect measures. Most studies reported higher ARB prevalence or concentration downstream/near the source. However, this evidence was primarily descriptive and it could not be concluded that there is a clear impact of point sources on increases in ARB in the environment. To quantify increases in ARB in the environment due to specific point sources, there is a need for studies that stress study design, control of biases and analytical tools to provide effect measure estimates.},

	abstract = {Quercetin is a plant polyphenol with biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antidiabetic, neuroprotective and anti-allergic. The objective of this review is to provide a systematic evaluation of the evidence and a meta-analysis of data from previously published researches on the antidiabetic action of quercetin. A comprehensive literature search was conducted between July 2018 and August 2018 on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Sciences and Scopus databases. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled effect size and studies were weighted according to an estimate of the mean difference. The heterogeneity between studies was assessed using a Higgins' I2 test with corresponding p values. Overall 13 eligible articles with appropriate data on serum glucose were included in the statistical analysis. The meta-analysis for serum glucose level (mg/dL) showed that at doses of 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg there was a significant difference between the means. Therefore, the results of the meta-analysis support the hypothesis that quercetin lowers serum glucose level, at doses of 10, 25 and 50 mg/kg.},

	abstract = {Thymoquinone (2-isopropyl-5-methylbenzo-1, 4-quinone) (TQ) is a quinone derivative with a yellow crystalline appearance, abundantly found in black cumin, Nigella sativa L. TQ has diverse pharmacological properties. The aim of this systematic review on the antidiabetic effects of TQ is to evaluate the currently available evidence and conduct meta-analysis. A literature search of articles published until 25 January 2019 was done on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Sciences and Scopus databases, using relevant keywords. The meta-analysis included 18 studies that examined the serum glucose (SG) level or serum insulin level or body weight (BW). In the meta-analysis it was found that with an overall pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) of -9.176 mg/dl (95\%CI: -10.759, -7.593; p = 0.000); TQ reduced the SG level (-9.176 mg/dl) significantly in the STZ-induced diabetes model. Moreover, a meta-analysis of the effect of TQ on BW demonstrated that TQ has a statistically significant effect on the BW of diabetic animals with an overall pooled SMD of 4.509 (95\%CI: 3.234, 5.784; p = 0.000). In addition, the overall pooled estimate of the level of serum insulin was significant with SMD of 1.681 (95\%CI: 0.858, 2.503; p = 0.000). Therefore, the meta-analysis showed that TQ has a significant antidiabetic effect through its action on the SG, serum insulin level, and BW of the animals.},

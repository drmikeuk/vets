	abstract = {Acupuncture is a popular complementary treatment option in human medicine. Increasingly, owners also seek acupuncture for their animals. The aim of the systematic review reported here was to summarize and assess the clinical evidence for or against the effectiveness of acupuncture in veterinary medicine. Systematic searches were conducted on Medline, Embase, Amed, Cinahl, Japana Centra Revuo Medicina and Chikusan Bunken Kensaku. Hand-searches included conference proceedings, bibliographies, and contact with experts and veterinary acupuncture associations. There were no restrictions regarding the language of publication. All controlled clinical trials testing acupuncture in any condition of domestic animals were included. Studies using laboratory animals were excluded. Titles and abstracts of identified articles were read, and hard copies were obtained. Inclusion and exclusion of studies, data extraction, and validation were performed independently by two reviewers. Methodologic quality was evaluated by means of the Jadad score. Fourteen randomized controlled trials and 17 nonrandomized controlled trials met our criteria and were, therefore, included. The methodologic quality of these trials was variable but, on average, was low. For cutaneous pain and diarrhea, encouraging evidence exists that warrants further investigation in rigorous trials. Single studies reported some positive intergroup differences for spinal cord injury, Cushing's syndrome, lung function, hepatitis, and rumen acidosis. These trials require independent replication. On the basis of the findings of this systematic review, there is no compelling evidence to recommend or reject acupuncture for any condition in domestic animals. Some encouraging data do exist that warrant further investigation in independent rigorous trials.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the quality and comparability of published literature, and to summarize the effect of prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGF(2alpha)) for the treatment of endometritis. It has been postulated that there is a dearth of high-level evidence-based research results in veterinary medicine. Also, there is a marked variation in the quality of studies in veterinary and animal science. Post-partum uterine infections occur commonly in dairy cattle and are reported to have a negative impact on reproductive performance. A comprehensive literature search was conducted utilizing online databases revealing a total of 2723 references. After applying specific exclusion criteria, a total of 68 trials were eligible for further analysis. These articles were evaluated utilizing specific parameters listed in an evaluation form such as randomization and the involvement of control groups. The analysis revealed that more than half of the trials (51.5\%) were at least 20 years old. Furthermore, we found that about one third (36.8\%) of all trials were controlled and randomized, while 3 of those (4.4\%) were also blinded. Of those trials which calculated a calving-to-conception interval (n=30), 50\% of the authors claimed an improvement, which was statistically significant in 23.3\% of the cases. We conclude that there is a wide discrepancy between research results investigating the efficacy of PGF(2alpha).},

	abstract = {Acute puerperal metritis (APM) is an acute systemic illness with fever {\textgreater}/=39.5 degrees C and signs of toxemia due to an infection of the uterus occurring within 21 d after parturition. Because of the infectious nature of APM, antibiotics are considered beneficial for its treatment. Each use of an antimicrobial drug, however, is associated with selective pressure for the emergence of resistant bacteria. Hence, there is a significant need to encourage prudent use of antibiotics and alternative therapies to antibiotics. Therefore, the objective of this study was to systematically review the current literature on treatment of APM. A comprehensive and systematic literature search was conducted utilizing the PubMed and CAB Abstracts databases to identify literature focusing on the antibiotic therapy of puerperal metritis in the cow. After application of specific exclusion criteria, 21 publications comprising 23 trials remained for final evaluation. Data extraction revealed that the majority of the studies (n = 19) were attributable to the highest evidence level. Of 21 studies controlled, 11 had an untreated group and 3 a positive control group. The majority of the studies (n = 17) applied ceftiofur for the treatment of APM. Concerning the efficacy of ceftiofur, 7 studies observed clinical improvement, whereas none found improved reproductive performance. Fewer than half of the studies (n = 10) performed a bacteriological examination and only 4 implemented an antibiotic susceptibility test. Also, 3 studies (13.0\%) described a self-cure rate per se. Little attention was given to the issue of bacterial resistance (n = 3), the need for reducing the application of antibiotics (n = 2), or guidelines for prudent use of antibiotics (n = 1). Our findings demonstrate that implementation of bacteriological examinations, sensitivity testing, and determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations, as well as reporting and discussion of critical issues (e.g., self-cure rates, resistance, prudent drug use), were suboptimal. On the other hand, the quality of studies on the treatment of APM was good, as indicated by evidence level 1. Nevertheless, more high-quality research considering self-cure rates is necessary to address critical issues related to APM and crucial to the dairy industry, such as resistance, prudent use of antibiotics, animal welfare, and cost-benefit ratios.},

	abstract = {The objective of the conducted meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy of the treatment of bovine endometritis with PGF2alpha by statistical means. Postpartum uterine infections have a high prevalence and a very negative effect on reproductive performance in dairy cattle. Because of a wide discordance between research results, a meta-analysis of the efficacy of the treatment of bovine endometritis with PGF2alpha was conducted. A comprehensive literature search was performed using online databases to reveal a total of 2,307 references. In addition, 5 articles were retrieved by reviewing citations. After applying specific exclusion criteria and evaluating specific evidence parameters, 5 publications, comprising 6 trials, were eligible for being analyzed by means of meta-analysis. Data for each trial were extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis software Review Manager (version 5.1; The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark). Estimated effect sizes of PGF2alpha were calculated on calving to first service and calving to conception interval. Prostaglandin F2alpha treatment of cows with chronic endometritis had a negative effect on both reproductive performance parameters. Heterogeneity was substantial for calving to first service and calving to conception interval [I(2) (measure of variation beyond chance)=100 and 87\%, respectively]; therefore, random-effects models were used. Sensitivity analysis as well as subgroup analysis showed that the performance of randomization was influential in modifying effect size of PGF2alpha treatment. The funnel plot illustrated a publication bias toward smaller studies that reported a prolonged calving to conception interval after a PGF2alpha treatment. We conclude that the investigation of this subject by means of meta-analysis did not reveal an improvement of reproductive performance of cows with endometritis after treatment with PGF2alpha. Furthermore, there is a shortage of comparable high quality studies investigating reproductive performance after PGF2alpha treatment of cows with chronic endometritis.},

Peer-reviewed, symposium, and unpublished studies were considered in the analysis. Clinical protection and virological protection against FMD were used as parameters to assess the efficacy of emergency vaccination. The clinical protection was estimated based on the appearance of clinical signs including FMD lesions and fever, while the virological protection parameter was estimated based on the outcome of laboratory tests that were used to diagnose FMD infection. A meta-analysis relative risk was calculated per protection parameter. Results of the meta-analyses were examined using publication bias tests. In total, 31 studies were included in the analyses, of which 26 were peer-reviewed studies, 1 was a symposium study and 4 were unpublished studies. Cattle, swine and sheep were well protected against clinical disease and FMD infection following the use of emergency vaccine. Fortunately, no significant bias that would alter the conclusions was encountered in the analysis.

Although several published studies have estimated the cure rate of IMI after DCT, variation among studies is great, which makes it difficult to conduct a proper economic evaluation of DCT. The objective of the present meta-analysis of existing peer-reviewed literature was to provide a summary quantification of quarter IMI cure based on DCT. A meta-analysis relative risk (RR) was calculated per intervention and pathogen group when at least 4 studies were available for analysis per comparison from the 22 selected studies, according to the selection criteria. Results of the meta-analysis were examined using publication bias tests. Blanket DCT with a 95\% confidence interval (CI) provided a 1.78 (1.51 to 2.10) times higher calculated cure rate from quarter IMI during the dry period up to 21 d postcalving, compared with no DCT. The RR of cure was similar when treatment was conducted for Streptococcus spp. IMI quarters compared with Staphylococcus spp. IMI quarters. The pooled RR with the 95\% CI were 1.83 (1.48 to 2.35) and 1.65 (1.38 to 1.96), respectively. There was no significant difference between cloxacillin and other DCT products in the cure of quarter IMI during the dry period up to 21 d postcalving. The pooled RR with the 95\% CI was 1.00 (0.92 to 1.09). Similarly, there was no significant difference between cloxacillin and other DCT products in the cure of quarter Staphylococcus spp. IMI. The pooled RR with the 95\% CI was 1.00 (0.96 to 1.06). The pooled RR with the 95\% CI of quarter IMI cure using selective DCT, compared with no DCT, was 1.76 (1.23 to 2.54).},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to estimate the preventive effect of various dry cow management measures against quarter new intramammary infections (IMI) during the dry period up to 21 d postcalving. Moreover, the potential publication bias was assessed in the studies selected for this analysis. The intervention measures were blanket dry cow therapy (BDCT), selective dry cow therapy (SDCT), cloxacillin compared with other dry cow therapy products, and teat sealant. A meta-analysis relative risk (RR) was calculated per intervention and pathogen group when enough studies were available from the 33 selected studies. Results of the meta-analyses were examined using publication bias tests. Blanket dry cow therapy showed significant protection against new IMI caused by Streptococcus spp. [the pooled RR was 0.39 (0.30 to 0.51)] but no protection was observed against coliform new IMI [the pooled RR was 0.95 (0.81 to 1.10)]. After correction for publication bias, it became doubtful whether DCT is protective against new Staphylococcus spp. IMI. Cloxacillin showed similar protection against new quarter IMI compared with other DCT products [the pooled RR was 1.09 (0.94 to 1.25)]. Selective dry cow therapy showed higher protection against new IMI compared with no DCT [the pooled RR was 0.51 (0.30 to 0.86)]. However, BDCT showed more protection when compared with SDCT [the pooled RR was 0.55 (0.37 to 0.80)], but the inference about whether BDCT is superior to SDCT was dependent on whether the selection criteria for SDCT was at the cow or quarter level. Internal teat sealants showed significant protection against new IMI during the dry period [the pooled RR was 0.39 (0.18 to 0.82)]. Publication bias should be taken into account when attempts are made to review literature in a meta-analysis.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the dependence of echocardiographic ratio indices (ERIs) on age, body weight (BW) and breed/study group using individually contributed and published summarized data in dogs. BACKGROUND: ERIs allow for narrow prediction intervals of M-mode echocardiographic measurements in generic adult dogs. Breed and age-specific differences have not been examined systematically using ERI methods. ANIMALS, MATERIALS AND METHODS: Individual M-mode measurements were contributed by 15 published investigators from 661 dogs, allowing direct calculation of ERIs and summary statistics for each of these breed/study groups. M-mode ERI summary statistics were estimated from published summaries of 22 additional groups that included 527 adult and 36 growing dogs. Individual two-dimensional (2DE) left atrial (LA) and aortic root (Ao) measurements were contributed from 36 dogs. ERIs were analyzed for dependence on BW, breed/study group and age. RESULTS: The majority of variation among ERIs was due to differences in the breed or study technique with comparatively little dependence on BW. Age dependence of ERIs was seen in the early growth phases of young dogs, but expected values for each ERI became static long before maturity, roughly at 10-12 weeks of age. ERIs derived from individual 2DE LA and Ao measurements showed no significant dependence on BW. CONCLUSIONS: ERIs are well normalized for body size and may be useful for clinical evaluation of individuals, prediction of expected M-mode and 2DE cardiac dimensions, and investigation of age or breed-specific cardiac shape changes.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Around 67 million pets are owned by households in the United Kingdom, and an increasing number of these are exotic animals. Approximately a third of pets are purchased through retail outlets or direct from breeders. A wide range of infections can be associated with companion animals. OBJECTIVES: This study uses a systematic literature review to describe the transmission of zoonotic disease in humans associated with a pet shop or other location selling pets (incidents of rabies tracebacks and zoonoses from pet food were excluded). DATA SOURCES: PubMed and EMBASE. RESULTS: Fifty seven separate case reports or incidents were described in the 82 papers that were identified by the systematic review. Summary information on each incident is included in this manuscript. The infections include bacterial, viral and fungal diseases and range in severity from mild to life threatening. Infections associated with birds and rodents were the most commonly reported. Over half of the reports describe incidents in the Americas, and three of these were outbreaks involving more than 50 cases. Many of the incidents identified relate to infections in pet shop employees. LIMITATIONS: This review may have been subject to publication bias, where unusual and unexpected zoonotic infections may be over-represented in peer-reviewed publications. It was also restricted to English-language articles so that pathogens that are more common in non-Western countries, or in more exotic animals not common in Europe and the Americas, may have been under-represented. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: A wide spectrum of zoonotic infections are acquired from pet shops. Salmonellosis and psittacosis were the most commonly documented diseases, however more unusual infections such as tularemia also appeared in the review. Given their potential to spread zoonotic infection, it is important that pet shops act to minimise the risk as far as possible.},

DESIGN: Standardized, systematic evaluation of the literature, categorization of relevant articles according to level of evidence and quality, and development of consensus on conclusions for application of the concepts to clinical practice. SETTING: Academic and referral veterinary medical centers. RESULTS: Databases searched included Medline, CAB abstracts, and Google Scholar. CONCLUSIONS: All 4 standard thromboelastography (TEG) and rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) variables should be universally reported, and the reporting of shear elastic modulus in addition to maximum amplitude (MA) is encouraged. There is insufficient evidence to support universal usage of the coagulation index at this time. The K value and clot formation time are the most variable of the 4 parameters, with alpha angle, MA, and maximum clot firmness generally the least variable. Individual studies should report sufficient data on patients and institutional controls to enable definitions of hypo- and hypercoagulability to be evaluated post-hoc, and it is recommended that all studies specifically report how these conditions were defined. In reporting data relating to fibrinolysis, the TEG variables LY30, LY60, CL30, CL60, and the ROTEM variables LI30, LI60, ML, LOT, and LT should be documented. Studies should report sufficient data on patients and controls to enable definitions of hyper- and hypofibrinolysis to be evaluated post-hoc, and we suggest that standard TEG/ROTEM assays may be unable to detect hypofibrinolysis in companion animals. We recommend that every center establish reference intervals, which are specific to either TEG or ROTEM. These reference intervals should be established using veterinary clinical pathology guidelines, standardized protocols, and a minimum of 40 healthy animals. There are currently insufficient data in companion animals to suggest a utility for Vcurve variables beyond that of standard TEG variables.},

	abstract = {Despite differences in focus, goals, and strategies between conservation biology and animal welfare, both are inextricably linked in many ways, and greater consideration of animal welfare, although important in its own right, also has considerable potential to contribute to conservation success. Nevertheless, animal welfare and animal ethics are not always considered explicitly within conservation practice. We systematically reviewed the recent scientific peer-reviewed and online gray literature on reintroductions of captive-bred and wild-caught animals (mammals, birds, amphibians, and reptiles) to quantify the occurrence of animal welfare issues. We considered monitoring that could be indicative of the animal's welfare status and supportive management actions that could improve animal welfare (regardless of whether the aim was explicitly animal-welfare orientated). Potential welfare issues (of variable nature and extent) were recorded in 67\% of 199 projects reviewed; the most common were mortality {\textgreater}50\%, dispersal or loss of animals, disease, and human conflict. Most ({\textgreater}70\%) projects monitored survival, 18\% assessed body condition, and 2\% monitored stress levels. Animal welfare, explicitly, was referred to in 6\% of projects. Supportive actions, most commonly use of on-site prerelease pens and provision of supplemental food or water, were implemented in 79\% of projects, although the extent and duration of support varied. Practitioners can address animal-welfare issues in reintroductions by considering the potential implications for individual animals at all stages of the release process using the decision tree presented. We urge practitioners to report potential animal-welfare issues, describe mitigation actions, and evaluate their efficacy to facilitate transparent evaluation of common moral dilemmas and to advance communal strategies for dealing with them. Currently, comparative mortality rates, health risks, postrelease stress, effectiveness of supportive measures, and behavior of individuals warrant further research to improve animal welfare in reintroductions and to increase success of such projects.},

Nevertheless, our knowledge of the impact of climate change on livestock infectious diseases is much less certain. Therefore, the aim of the article is to conduct a systematic review of the literature on the topic utilizing available retrospective data and information. Across a corpus of 175 formal publications, limited empirical evidence was offered to underpin many of the main arguments. The literature reviewed was highly polarized and often inconsistent regarding what the future may hold. Historical explorations were rare. However, identifying past drivers to livestock disease may not fully capture the extent that new and unknown drivers will influence future change. As such, our current predictive capacity is low. We offer a number of recommendations to strengthen this capacity in the coming years. We conclude that our current approach to research on the topic is limiting and unlikely to yield sufficient, actionable evidence to inform future praxis. Therefore, we argue for the creation of a reflexive, knowledge-based system, underpinned by a collective intelligence framework to support the drawing of inferences across the literature.},

Recently, the health impacts of harmful cyanobacteria blooms are becoming more frequently detected and reported. However, reports of human and animal illnesses or deaths associated with harmful cyanobacteria blooms tend to be investigated and reported separately. Consequently, professionals working in human or in animal health do not always communicate findings related to these events with one another. Using the One Health concept of integration and collaboration among health disciplines, we systematically review the existing literature to discover where harmful cyanobacteria-associated animal illnesses and deaths have served as sentinel events to warn of potential human health risks. We find that illnesses or deaths among livestock, dogs and fish are all potentially useful as sentinel events for the presence of harmful cyanobacteria that may impact human health. We also describe ways to enhance the value of reports of cyanobacteria-associated illnesses and deaths in animals to protect human health. Efficient monitoring of environmental and animal health in a One Health collaborative framework can provide vital warnings of cyanobacteria-associated human health risks.},

A more complete understanding of the ecology of these pathogens in people and rats is critical for determining the public health risks associated with urban rats and for developing strategies to monitor and mitigate those risks. Although the ecology of rat-associated zoonoses is complex, due to the multiple ways in which rats, people, pathogens, vectors, and the environment may interact, common determinants of human disease can still be identified. This review summarizes the ecology of zoonoses associated with urban rats with a view to identifying similarities, critical differences, and avenues for further study.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Randomization, allocation concealment, and blind outcome assessment have been shown to reduce bias in human studies. Authors from the Collaborative Approach to Meta Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies (CAMARADES) collaboration recently found that these features protect against bias in animal stroke studies. We extended the scope the work from CAMARADES to include investigations of treatments for any condition. METHODS: We conducted an overview of systematic reviews. We searched Medline and Embase for systematic reviews of animal studies testing any intervention (against any control) and we included any disease area and outcome. We included reviews comparing randomized versus not randomized (but otherwise controlled), concealed versus unconcealed treatment allocation, or blinded versus unblinded outcome assessment. RESULTS: Thirty-one systematic reviews met our inclusion criteria: 20 investigated treatments for experimental stroke, 4 reviews investigated treatments for spinal cord diseases, while 1 review each investigated treatments for bone cancer, intracerebral hemorrhage, glioma, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and treatments used in emergency medicine. In our sample 29\% of studies reported randomization, 15\% of studies reported allocation concealment, and 35\% of studies reported blinded outcome assessment. We pooled the results in a meta-analysis, and in our primary analysis found that failure to randomize significantly increased effect sizes, whereas allocation concealment and blinding did not. In our secondary analyses we found that randomization, allocation concealment, and blinding reduced effect sizes, especially where outcomes were subjective. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates the need for randomization, allocation concealment, and blind outcome assessment in animal research across a wide range of outcomes and disease areas. Since human studies are often justified based on results from animal studies, our results suggest that unduly biased animal studies should not be allowed to constitute part of the rationale for human trials.},

It identifies, tabulates and classifies relevant published work and was conducted using electronic reference databases (BIDS ISI, BIOSIS, MEDLINE and the CAB Abstracts CD-ROM). A total of 1373 unique references were obtained from 1981 to 2000, of which 914 were written in the English language. A written search protocol was designed to ensure transparency and repeatability. Pilot studies were undertaken to create search terms that minimised bias and ensured relevance. Electronic files of the search terms allow the database to be updated in future. A further 93 references were included from the most recent international conference on lameness giving a total of 1007 English language references. The systematic review process is described, including a method of classifying papers according to their study design and statistical analysis, and it is hoped that other veterinary researchers will conduct similar reviews in their fields. The compiled and classified references are available as a searchable database through the web-sitehttp://cattle-lameness.dhs.org/. The review may be used in several ways; to identify practical interventions to reduce lameness in dairy cows and to use the resultant web-site as the basis of a decision support system for farmers, veterinarians and advisors.},

	abstract = {Crop-raiding is a major source of conflict between people and wildlife globally, impacting local livelihoods and impeding conservation. Conflict mitigation strategies that target problematic wildlife behaviours such as crop-raiding are notoriously difficult to develop for large-bodied, cognitively complex species. Many crop-raiders are generalist feeders. In more ecologically specialised species crop-type selection is not random and evidence-based management requires a good understanding of species' ecology and crop feeding habits. Comprehensive species-wide studies of crop consumption by endangered wildlife are lacking but are important for managing human-wildlife conflict. We conducted a comprehensive literature search of crop feeding records by wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), a ripe-fruit specialist. We assessed quantitatively patterns of crop selection in relation to species-specific feeding behaviour, agricultural exposure, and crop availability. Crop consumption by chimpanzees is widespread in tropical Africa. Chimpanzees were recorded to eat a considerable range of cultivars (51 plant parts from 36 species). Crop part selection reflected a species-typical preference for fruit. Crops widely distributed in chimpanzee range countries were eaten at more sites than sparsely distributed crops. We identified 'high' and 'low' conflict crops according to their attractiveness to chimpanzees, taking account of their importance as cash crops and/or staple foods to people. Most (86\%) high conflict crops were fruits, compared to 13\% of low conflict crops. Some widely farmed cash or staple crops were seldom or never eaten by chimpanzees. Information about which crops are most frequently consumed and which are ignored has enormous potential for aiding on-the-ground stakeholders (i.e. farmers, wildlife managers, and conservation and agricultural extension practitioners) develop sustainable wildlife management schemes for ecologically specialised and protected species in anthropogenic habitats. However, the economic and subsistence needs of local people, and the crop-raiding behaviour of sympatric wildlife, must be considered when assessing suitability of particular crops for conflict prevention and mitigation.},

DESIGN: Standardized, systematic evaluation of the literature, categorization of relevant articles according to level of evidence and quality, and development of consensus on conclusions for application of the concepts to clinical practice. Relevant questions were answered on a worksheet template and reviewed by the Reassessment Campaign on Veterinary Resuscitation (RECOVER) BLS domain members, by the RECOVER committee and opened for comments by veterinary professionals for 30 days. SETTING: Academia, referral practice, and general practice. RESULTS: Sixteen worksheets were prepared to evaluate techniques for chest compression and ventilation strategies as well as identification of cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA). Major recommendations arising from this evidence review include performing chest compressions at a rate of at least 100/min at a compression depth of one-third to half the width of the chest with minimal pauses, and early instigation of ventilation at a rate of 8-10 breaths/min in intubated patients, or using a 30:2 compression/ventilation ratio in nonintubated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although veterinary clinical trials are lacking, much of the experimental literature on BLS utilized canine models. The major conclusions from this analysis of the literature are the importance of early identification of CPA, and immediate initiation of BLS in these patients. Many knowledge gaps exist, most importantly in our understanding of the optimal hand placement and technique for chest compressions, warranting coordinated future studies targeted at questions of relevance to differences between veterinary species and humans.},

Fourteen papers evaluated safety with calculated experimental (adverse) event rates (EER) between 0 and 0.31, but there was no correlation between study length and EER (rs=-0.109, P=0.793). The balance of evidence for the efficacy of NSAIDs supports longer-term use of these agents for increased clinical effect.

	abstract = {This report aims to present data and expert knowledge on poverty and zoonoses hotspots to inform prioritization of study areas on the transmission of disease in emerging livestock systems in the developing world, where prevention of zoonotic disease might bring greatest benefit to poor people. The first chapter reviews the substantial literature on prioritizing disease and identifies prioritization criteria relevant to this study, namely: burden of human disease; impacts on livestock production and productivity; amenability to agricultural intervention; and, concern because of emergence or severity. This allowed the identification of 24 zoonoses of high importance to poor people, 13 of which were investigated in depth. The next chapter reviews current evidence on poverty and livestock, on livestock systems and their dynamics, and on zoonoses and how they are currently mapped. The map of poor livestock keepers is updated and an additional map based on subnational data is presented. Maps of livestock systems that are changing most rapidly in response to emerging markets are also presented, and vulnerability to climate change is described. The strengths and weaknesses of different maps are noted. The next chapter presents evidence from a systematic review of over 1000 studies on the prevalence of the 13 priority zoonoses in people and animals. It focuses on the endemic zoonoses that impose greatest burden and a 'top 20' list is given of geographical hotspots. Data on zoonoses are also extracted from the WHO Global Burden of Disease and the 'top 20' countries identified. A case study that compares our systematic review with an 'in-country review' focusing on grey literature and literature in a language other than English is included. Some of the challenges of the study and caution in interpreting the results are discussed. The next chapter updates the map of emerging disease events. For the first time, emerging zoonoses are mapped as distinct from other emerging disease events. The last chapter provides maps of regional agroecosystems and summarizes numbers of livestock, people and poor livestock keepers by system as well as the zoonoses context. It also draws some global conclusions from the study.},

	abstract = {Oxidative stress is the unifying feature underlying the toxicity of anthropogenic pollution (e.g., heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and nitrogen-oxides) and the ultimate culprit in the development of many diseases. Yet, there has been no attempt to summarize the published data on wild terrestrial animals to reveal general trends regarding the effects of pollution on oxidative stress. The main findings of this meta-analysis reveal that, as predicted, there is an overall increase in oxidative stress when exposed to pollution. This is mainly due to a weak overall increase of oxidative damages, although there is some variation across taxa. The reduced form of glutathione (GSH) and its associated enzymes are the most reliable biomarkers. This result is important when choosing biomarkers and when using less-invasive sampling of endangered species, or for longitudinal approaches. To be able to predict future population outcomes, possible treatments, but also evolutionary responses to a changing environment, a greater integration of biotic factors such as temperature, bioavailability of toxic elements, and species-specific responses are needed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli O157 (EcO157) infection has been recognized as an important global public health concern. But information on the prevalence of EcO157 in cattle at the global and at the wider geographical levels is limited, if not absent. This is the first meta-analysis to investigate the point prevalence of EcO157 in cattle at the global level and to explore the factors contributing to variation in prevalence estimates. METHODS: Seven electronic databases- CAB Abstracts, PubMed, Biosis Citation Index, Medline, Web of Knowledge, Scirus and Scopus were searched for relevant publications from 1980 to 2012. A random effect meta-analysis model was used to produce the pooled estimates. The potential sources of between study heterogeneity were identified using meta-regression. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 140 studies consisting 220,427 cattle were included in the meta-analysis. The prevalence estimate of EcO157 in cattle at the global level was 5.68\% (95\% CI, 5.16-6.20). The random effects pooled prevalence estimates in Africa, Northern America, Oceania, Europe, Asia and Latin America-Caribbean were 31.20\% (95\% CI, 12.35-50.04), 7.35\% (95\% CI, 6.44-8.26), 6.85\% (95\% CI, 2.41-11.29), 5.15\% (95\% CI, 4.21-6.09), 4.69\% (95\% CI, 3.05-6.33) and 1.65\% (95\% CI, 0.77-2.53), respectively. Between studies heterogeneity was evidenced in most regions. World region (p{\textless}0.001), type of cattle (p{\textless}0.001) and to some extent, specimens (p = 0.074) as well as method of pre-enrichment (p = 0.110), were identified as factors for variation in the prevalence estimates of EcO157 in cattle. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of the organism seems to be higher in the African and Northern American regions. The important factors that might have influence in the estimates of EcO157 are type of cattle and kind of screening specimen. Their roles need to be determined and they should be properly handled in any survey to estimate the true prevalence of EcO157.},

	abstract = {The use of systems for pressure measurement between the rider's body and the back of the horse is a relatively new procedure. The size and transfer of the load inside the horse-pad-saddle-rider system can be assessed in various ways. This paper provides a review of literature published from 1994 to 2010 that discusses using pressure mapping systems for measuring the contact load between the horse and its rider. Literature was obtained using common scientific databases such as Web of Science, SCOPUS and PubMed entering the key words: "horse", "pressure", and "back". The first published studies aimed to verify sensor parameters and to minimize animal- and operator-induced errors. In order to obtain valid and reliable data, it is important to perform pressure measurements under highly standardized conditions. Moreover using properly established guidelines for calibrating and placing sensors is crucial for receiving valid data. Subsequent studies focused on the influence of various types of saddles, pads, blankets and adjustments of saddle fit on the loading of the horse's back. Results of these studies showed that using pressure mapping systems provide a useful evaluation of the load applied to the area of contact between the horse and rider. A properly fitted saddle with a pad can serve as a shock absorber. Literature findings suggest that improving the fit of a saddle by using a saddle pad needs to be individually adapted for each horse and rider. Considering the current status of literature on the use of pressure mapping systems in horseback riding future research should concentrate on using data obtained by biomechanical modelling of contact surfaces, including their interactions; on determining a "normal pattern" of pressure distribution on the equine back; and on finding a way to include individual parameters of the horse and its rider into the overall assessment.},

	abstract = {Historically, serological tests for finfish diseases have been underused when compared with their use in terrestrial animal health. For years the nonspecific immune response in fish was judged to make serology unreliable and inferior to the direct measurement of agent analytes. We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed publications that reported on the development, validation, or application of serological tests for finfish diseases. A total of 168 articles met the screening criteria; most of them were focused on salmonid pathogens (e.g., Aeromonas spp. and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus). Before the 1980s, most publications reported the use of agglutination tests, but our review indicates that enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has more recently become the dominant serological test. The main application of serological tests has been in the assessment of vaccine efficacy, with few applications for surveillance or demonstration of freedom from disease, despite the advantages of serological tests over direct detection at the population level. Nonlethal sampling, low cost, and postinfection persistence of antibodies make serological assays the test of choice in surveillance, especially of valuable broodstock. However, their adoption has been constrained by poor characterization and validation. The number of publications in our review reporting diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of serological tests in finfish was small (n = 7). Foreseeing a wider use of serological tests in the future for diagnostic end purposes, we offer recommendations for mitigating deficiencies in the development and evaluation of serological tests, including optimization, control of nonspecific reactions, informed cutoff points, diagnostic accuracy, and serological baseline studies. Achieving these goals will facilitate greater international recognition of serological testing in programs supporting aquatic animal health. Received March 21, 2016; accepted September 24, 2016.},

The possibility of its clinical use against other invasive mycoses, has aroused the interest of numerous investigators in evaluating its efficacy in different animal models. OBJECTIVES: To critically review the current data on the use of micafungin in the treatment of invasive mycoses in animal models. METHODS: We searched the PubMed/Medline data base (National Library of Medicine) from 2005 to 2008, both inclusive, on the use of micafungin in the experimental treatment of the fungal infection. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Seven, of a total of 18 articles reviewed, were done in animal models of candidiasis and six in animal models of pulmonary or SNC aspergillosis. Similarly to the other echinocandins, caspofungin and anidulafungin, micafungin seems to exert a fungicidal activity against Candida albicans and Candida glabrata and a fungistatic activity against Aspergillus fumigatus. The paradoxical effect observed in lung tissue the experimental caspofungin treatment of aspergillosis has not been seen in the case of micafungin. The available data demonstrate a higher efficacy of micafungin versus fluconazole in the experimental treatment of C. albicans infections caused by strains susceptible in vitro to both drugs. To improve the efficacy of micafungin in the treatment of C. glabrata and A. fumigatus infections, several authors have tested different combined therapies, the combination of micafungin with amphotericin B being that showed the best results.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the extent to which dietary tannin level is related to methane emissions from ruminants. Data from a total of 30 experiments comprising 171 treatments were entered in a database. In vitro batch culture and in vivo measurements were distinguished as experimental approaches. With any approach, methane declined when dietary tannins increased. The in vitro approach predicted the in vivo response quite accurately. However, in vitro, the response followed a quadratic response pattern (R(2) = 0.66; lower response with increasing tannin level), whereas in vivo, this decline was linear (R(2) = 0.29). This indicates that the in vitro batch culture is of limited accuracy for estimating effects at levels {\textgreater}100 g tannin/kg dry matter. The large variation in methane/digestible organic matter (OM) found at low tannin levels may explain contrasting literature reports. Methane reduction with tannins was associated with a reduced apparent digestion of OM, and especially fibre, but methane/apparently digestible OM declined also. The present findings are helpful as they identified an underlying general antimethanogenic effect of tannins across tannin sources and experimental conditions, thus allowing concentrating the search on sources with satisfactory palatability and low adverse effects on animal performance.},

	abstract = {Saponins have been considered as promising natural substances for mitigating methane emissions from ruminants. However, studies reported that addition of saponin-rich sources often arrived at contrasting results, i.e. either it decreased methane or it did not. The aim of the present study was to assess ruminal methane emissions through a meta-analytical approach of integrating related studies from published papers which described various levels of different saponin-rich sources being added to ruminant feed. A database was constructed from published literature reporting the addition of saponin-rich sources at various levels and then monitoring ruminal methane emissions in vitro. Accordingly, levels of saponin-rich source additions as well as different saponin sources were specified in the database. Apart from methane, other related rumen fermentation parameters were also included in the database, i.e. organic matter digestibility, gas production, pH, ammonia concentration, short-chain fatty acid profiles and protozoal count. A total of 23 studies comprised of 89 data points met the inclusion criteria. The data obtained were subsequently subjected to a statistical meta-analysis based on mixed model methodology. Accordingly, different studies were treated as random effects whereas levels of saponin-rich source additions or different saponin sources were considered as fixed effects. Model statistics used were p-value and root mean square error. Results showed that an addition of increasing levels of a saponin-rich source decreased methane emission per unit of substrate incubated as well as per unit of total gas produced (p{\textless}0.05). There was a decrease in acetate proportion (linear pattern; p{\textless}0.001) and an increase in propionate proportion (linear pattern; p{\textless}0.001) with increasing levels of saponin. Log protozoal count decreased (p{\textless}0.05) at higher saponin levels. Comparing between different saponin-rich sources, all saponin sources, i.e. quillaja, tea and yucca saponins produced less methane per unit of total gas than that of control (p{\textless}0.05). Although numerically the order of effectiveness of saponin-rich sources in mitigating methane was yucca {\textgreater} tea {\textgreater} quillaja, statistically they did not differ each other. It can be concluded that methane mitigating properties of saponins in the rumen are level- and source-dependent.},

	abstract = {Data implicating mucosal cytokines in the pathogenesis of canine inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are limited. The aims of the present study were to report new findings of intestinal cytokine expression in dogs with IBD and to compare these data with previous studies through meta-analysis. Cytokine mRNA abundance in intestinal biopsies collected prospectively was evaluated by using a semiquantitative RT-PCR technique. For meta-analysis, an electronic database search revealed 3 clinical trials, all of which were nonrandomized (type III) case series. Prospective analysis showed that the intestines of healthy dogs and those with IBD express numerous cytokines and that a proinflammatory expression profile is not a feature of small or large-intestinal IBD. The meta-analysis data included 158 dogs characterized as healthy (n = 45), diarrheic nonIBD dogs (n = 6), nonresponders (n = 2), small-intestinal IBD (n = 41), colonic IBD (n = 25), and chronic enteropathy (n = 39). German shepherd dogs were overrepresented in 3 of the 4 studies. Healthy dogs showed mRNA expression for most cytokines including IL2, IL4, IL5, IL10, IL12, IFNgamma, TNFalpha, and TGFbeta. Only IL12 mRNA expression was increased consistently in small-intestinal IBD, whereas IBD colitis lacked consistent patterns of expression. In summary, dogs with IBD fail to express a predominant Th1- or Th2 cytokine bias in inflamed mucosa. Heterogeneity of results among these studies might be explained by numerous factors including the method of mRNA quantification, stage of disease, and demographic differences in study populations.},

	abstract = {Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a major reason for antibiotic prescription in small animal practice. Optimal antibiotic treatment strategies have not been established for veterinary species, especially when considering duration of treatment, which is often considerably longer than for human patients with UTI. The aims of this study were (1) to identify and assess evidence related to the efficacy of antibiotic treatment in canine and feline UTIs; and (2) to compare the efficacy of short ({\textless}5 days) and standard ({\textgreater}/=7 days) duration of antibiotic treatment for canine uncomplicated UTI. An electronic literature search was conducted for publications to 1 May 2014. Fourteen peer-reviewed prospective and controlled studies were retrieved, 10 of which evaluated antibiotic treatment in dogs and four in cats. Of the 14 studies, seven were clinical trials and five of those were randomised controlled trials. Most (12/14) studies were not considered to contribute sufficient evidence to evaluate treatment strategies. There were no clinical studies examining the effect of duration of the same drug. Of the short duration regimens evaluated, the efficacy of 3 day antibiotic therapy with trimethoprim-sulphonamide (females only) or high-dose enrofloxacin in dogs with uncomplicated UTIs was supported by fair evidence, as these treatment strategies were non-inferior to medium duration (10-14 days) therapy with beta-lactam antimicrobials. In conclusion, there is little published evidence relating to antibiotic treatment of UTIs in dogs and cats. Well-designed clinical trials focusing on the duration of treatment are warranted to create evidence-based treatment protocols.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rabies still poses a significant human health problem throughout most of Africa, where the majority of the human cases results from dog bites. Mass dog vaccination is considered to be the most effective method to prevent rabies in humans. Our objective was to systematically review research articles on dog rabies parenteral vaccination coverage in Africa in relation to dog accessibility and vaccination cost recovery arrangement (i.e.free of charge or owner charged). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A systematic literature search was made in the databases of CAB abstracts (EBSCOhost and OvidSP), Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Medline (EBSCOhost and OvidSP) and AJOL (African Journal Online) for peer reviewed articles on 1) rabies control, 2) dog rabies vaccination coverage and 3) dog demography in Africa. Identified articles were subsequently screened and selected using predefined selection criteria like year of publication (viz. {\textgreater}/= 1990), type of study (cross sectional), objective(s) of the study (i.e. vaccination coverage rates, dog demographics and financial arrangements of vaccination costs), language of publication (English) and geographical focus (Africa). The selection process resulted in sixteen peer reviewed articles which were used to review dog demography and dog ownership status, and dog rabies vaccination coverage throughout Africa. The main review findings indicate that 1) the majority (up to 98.1\%) of dogs in African countries are owned (and as such accessible), 2) puppies younger than 3 months of age constitute a considerable proportion (up to 30\%) of the dog population and 3) male dogs are dominating in numbers (up to 3.6 times the female dog population). Dog rabies parenteral vaccination coverage was compared between "free of charge" and "owner charged" vaccination schemes by the technique of Meta-analysis. Results indicate that the rabies vaccination coverage following a free of charge vaccination scheme (68\%) is closer to the World Health Organization recommended coverage rate (70\%) than the achieved coverage rate in owner-charged dog rabies vaccination schemes (18\%). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Most dogs in Africa are owned and accessible for parenteral vaccination against rabies if the campaign is performed "free of charge".},

The study found several examples in which agricultural intensification and/or environmental change were associated with an increased risk of zoonotic disease emergence, driven by the impact of an expanding human population and changing human behavior on the environment. We conclude that the rate of future zoonotic disease emergence or reemergence will be closely linked to the evolution of the agriculture-environment nexus. However, available research inadequately addresses the complexity and interrelatedness of environmental, biological, economic, and social dimensions of zoonotic pathogen emergence, which significantly limits our ability to predict, prevent, and respond to zoonotic disease emergence.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preventive chemotherapy is a useful tool for the control of Taenia solium taeniasis and cysticercosis. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the scientific evidence concerning the effectiveness and safety of different drugs in preventive chemotherapy for T. solium taeniasis in endemic populations. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of controlled and uncontrolled studies, assessing the efficacy and adverse effects (among other outcomes) of albendazole, niclosamide and/or praziquantel for preventive chemotherapy of T. solium taeniasis. A comprehensive search was conducted for published and unpublished studies. Two reviewers screened articles, completed the data extraction and assessment of risk of bias. A meta-analysis of cure rate and relative reduction in prevalence was performed. The protocol for this review was registered on the International prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO), number CRD42018112533. RESULTS: We identified 3555 records, of which we included 20 primary studies reported across 33 articles. Meta-analyses of drug and dose showed that a single dose of praziquantel 10mg/kg, albendazole 400mg per day for three consecutive days, or niclosamide 2g, resulted in better cure rates for T. solium taeniasis (99.5\%, 96.4\% and 84.3\%, respectively) than praziquantel 5mg/kg or single dose albendazole 400mg (89.0\% and 52.0\%, respectively). These findings have a low certainty of evidence due to high risk of bias in individual studies and heterogeneity in combined estimates. In relation to side-effects, most studies reported either no or only mild and transient side-effects within the first three days following drug administration for all drugs and doses. CONCLUSION: Evidence indicated that praziquantel 10mg/kg, niclosamide 2g, and triple dose albendazole 400mg were effective as taenicides and could be considered for use in mass drug administration programs for the control of T. solium taeniasis. Evidence was not found that any of these drugs caused severe side effects at the indicated doses, although the extent of the available evidence was limited.},

	doi = {10.3168/jds.2018-14933},
	abstract = {The objective of the study was to update a prior meta-analysis on the efficacy of the treatment of bovine endometritis with PGF(2α). Clinical endometritis in cattle is defined as the presence of a purulent or mucopurulent vaginal discharge after 20 or 26 d, respectively, postpartum. Although the prevalence and impact of this disease are well known, the questions of whether and how to treat endometritis are still controversially discussed. Hence, to ensure timeliness of scientific results, we updated an existing meta-analysis published in 2013 that showed no treatment effect of PGF(2α) in cases of bovine endometritis. As in the prior meta-analysis, a comprehensive literature search was conducted. After applying specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, 3 trials remained that could be added to the 6 trials in the initial meta-analysis. Data for each trial were analyzed using the meta-analysis software Review Manager (version 5.3; The Nordic Cochrane Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark). Estimated effect sizes of PGF(2α) were calculated on calving to first service interval (CFSI) and calving to conception interval (CCI). As revealed by the initial meta-analysis, PGF(2α) treatment still had no effect on both reproductive parameters. Heterogeneity remained substantial for CFSI and CCI and even increased for CCI compared with the initial meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis, however, did not reveal a source of heterogeneity. In updating the meta-analysis, publication bias for trials reporting CCI became even more pronounced, suggesting that studies with higher standard error (i.e., usually smaller studies) that reported a prolonging effect on CCI after a PGF(2α) treatment were less likely to be published. Finally, although the number of trials published on the chosen topic and their comparability are still limited, this update of our meta-analysis now provides results that are based on approximately twice the number of included cows. The overall outcome, however, has not substantially changed and a positive effect of a PGF(2α) treatment in case of clinical endometritis could not be shown. Therefore, we do not recommend a treatment of bovine endometritis with PGF(2α) as a means to improve reproductive performance.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.vprsr.2019.100288},
	abstract = {Linguatula serrata is known as a cosmopolitan zoonotic parasite whose adult form inhabits the upper respiratory system, nasal airways and frontal sinuses of dogs, foxes, cats and other carnivores, which are recognized as its final hosts. Its immature form resides in mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, lungs and spleen of herbivorous and other ruminants, which serve as its intermediate hosts. Both adult and nymphal stages of L. serrata can infect humans, which typically occurs via ingestion of eggs of infected dogs or consumption of raw or undercooked infected viscera of contaminated herbivores. The most common form of infection in human is nasopharyngeal linguatulosis, also known as Halzoun syndrome or Marrara syndrome. This paper presents a review of previous studies on L. serrata conducted in Iran from 1969 to 2018 and other countries. It was found that despite the fact that many studies have been conducted in Iran, the rate of infection with this parasite has not been studied in some areas of the country. In addition, the rate of infection with L. serrata increased with the age of ruminant animals and it was significantly higher in some areas. The prevalence of L. serrata nymphal infections in most areas was higher in goats in comparison to the other animals which can be an important risk factor for human infection. Although there was no significant difference in the rate of infection among male and female animals, the prevalence of L. serrata in male animals was typically lower than females. There was no significant difference in the seasonality of nymph infection.},

Except one, all studies showed suppressing effects for RSV on the production of AGEs or receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and its detrimental consequences including oxidative stress, inflammatory response, cellular immune reactions, insulin response, and atherosclerosis. RSV exerts its effects through influencing RAGE, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β activities. This review suggests that RSV has got potential to decrease AGEs toxicity and inhibit the AGE-induced complications.

In this manuscript, we reviewed systematically the available literature on molecular epidemiology of ASF in Tanzania and its eight neighboring countries in order to establish the transmission dynamics of ASFV between these countries. Data were retrieved from World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS), Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, and CrossRef databases, using the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and reviewed to document ASF outbreaks and ASFV genotypes distribution. Using phylogeographic approach applied to ASFV p72 sequence dataset, the evolutionary history and the dispersal pattern of the ASFV strains were assessed. From 2005 to 2019, a total of 1588 ASF outbreaks affecting 341,742 cases that led to 302,739 domestic pig deaths were reported. The case fatality rates (CFR) varied from 15.41\% to 98.95\% with an overall CFR of 88.58\%. Fifteen different p72 ASFV genotypes were reported and the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) for ASFV strains dated back to 1652.233 (1626.473, 1667.735) with an evolutionary rate of 4.805 × 10(-5) (2.5857 × 10(-5), 9.7789 × 10(-5)). Phylogeographic dispersal analysis revealed several transboundary spread events of ASFV strains between these countries. These results suggest persistent circulation of ASFV in these countries and advocate for more research to improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of the virus and for a regional approach to mitigate the spread of ASFV.},

	abstract = {Due to the ongoing expansion of Ixodes scapularis (blacklegged tick) throughout the northeastern and midwestern United States, there is need to identify the role wildlife hosts play in the establishment and maintenance of tick populations. To quantify and synthesize the patterns of I. scapularis and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and sensu lato prevalence relative to wildlife hosts, we reviewed the findings of independent studies conducted throughout the United States. We performed a comprehensive literature search from 1970 to 2017 using the ISS Web of Science Core Collection and the keywords "Ixodes scapularis," "Ixodes dammini" and "Borrelia burgdorferi." We identified 116 studies for inclusion in our meta-analysis, with 187,414 individual wildlife hosts captured and examined for I. scapularis and either the host or ticks collected subsequently tested for B. burgdorferi. We found that only 13\% of the wildlife mammals sampled comprised species other than Odocoileus virginianus (white-tailed deer) and Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed mouse). To examine whether there were regional differences between the Northeast, Midwest and the Southeast U.S. in I. scapularis infestation rates on wildlife hosts, we used general linear models (glm), with post hoc pairwise comparisons. In most cases, detection of I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi was significantly higher in the Northeast than the Midwest. Using data on host-specific I. scapularis infestation prevalence, B. burgdorferi prevalence in feeding larvae, and host permissiveness, we developed an epizootiological model to determine the relative contributions of individual hosts to B. burgdorferi-infected nymphs. Our model provides additional evidence that wildlife hosts other than P. leucopus may contribute more to Lyme disease risk than commonly thought. To aid in understanding the ecology of Lyme disease, we propose that additional studies sample non-Peromyscus spp. hosts to obtain more detailed tick and pathogen infestation and infection estimates, respectively, for these less frequently sampled wildlife hosts.},

After removing duplicates and reviewing titles/abstracts, 117 articles were considered, out of which, 75 articles had sufficient quality for inclusion in this meta-analysis. The prevalence of Listeria spp. contamination was about 18.3\% in poultry, 8.5\% in raw meat, 14.6\% in ready-to-eat (RTE) foods, 10\% in sea foods, 7.3\% in traditional dairy, 3.2\% in commercial dairy, and 0.1\% in eggs. The findings showed that L. monocytogenes was most prevalent in ready to eat (9.2\%), seafood (5.1\%), poultry (5\%), traditional dairy (4\%), raw meat (2.6\%), commercial dairy (1.4\%), and egg (0.2\%), respectively. Furthermore, the presence of L. monocytogenes particularly in RTE foods (that are consumed without further heat processing) and under-cooked products could be a potential risk for public health. So, contamination should be controlled at all levels of the food chain.},

The variables extracted from the articles were classified according to the type of feeding system and tocopherol level in the diet of lambs. Production systems alter the qualitative characteristics of meat. Lambs raised exclusively on pasture present a higher tocopherol concentration in their meat, a lower omega 6:omega 3 ratio, a lower omega 6 concentration, and a higher conjugated linoleic acid concentration. Regardless of the dietary systems, when we classify the tocopherol levels of lamb diet, the tocopherol concentration and fatty acid level are altered by tocopherol levels in the diet. The lower tocopherol level in the diet results in meat with lower tocopherol concentration and with greater propensity to lipid oxidation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In pre-clinical research, systematic reviews have the potential to mitigate translational challenges by facilitating understanding of how pre-clinical studies can inform future clinical research. Yet their conduct is encumbered by heterogeneity in the outcomes measured and reported, and those outcomes may not always relate to the most clinically important outcomes. We aimed to systematically review outcomes measured and reported in pre-clinical in vivo studies of pharmacological interventions to treat high blood glucose in mouse models of type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A systematic review of pre-clinical in vivo studies of pharmacological interventions aimed at addressing elevated blood glucose in mouse models of type 2 diabetes was completed. Studies were screened for eligibility and outcomes extracted from the included studies. The outcomes were recorded verbatim and classified into outcome domains using an existing outcome taxonomy. Outcomes were also compared to those identified in a systematic review of registered phase 3/4 clinical trials for glucose lowering interventions in people with type 2 diabetes. RESULTS: Review of 280 included studies identified 532 unique outcomes across 19 domains. No single outcome, or domain, was measured in all studies and only 132 (21\%) had also been measured in registered phase 3/4 clinical trials. A core outcome set, representing the minimum that should be measured and reported, developed for type 2 diabetes effectiveness clinical trials includes 18 core outcomes, of these 12 (71\%) outcomes were measured and reported in one or more of the included pre-clinical studies. CONCLUSIONS: There is heterogeneity of outcomes reported in pre-clinical research. Harmonisation of outcomes across the research pathway using a core outcome set may facilitate interpretation, evidence synthesis and translational success, and may contribute to the refinement of the use of animals in research. Systematic review registration: The study was prospectively registered on the PROSPERO Database, registration number CRD42018106831.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to interrogate the evidence base for treatment of keratomalacia in dogs and cats, through examination of the applicable literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies were screened for evidence to answer the following question Which of the treatment options for keratomalacia in dogs and cats offers the best chance of globe survival, the fastest time to resolution with globe survival, and the best visual outcome. The search utilised the PubMed (http://www.pubmed.gov/) and ISI Web of Science (http://wok.mimas.ac.uk/) databases. Databases were searched using the following terms: (keratomalacia OR corneal melt OR corneal malacia) AND (dog OR canine OR canid OR cat OR feline OR felid) AND (treatment OR outcome OR morbidity OR complications). Studies were assessed by one author (CH) and excluded if they related to less than three keratomalacia cases, experimental treatments, in vitro studies, or did not provide information regarding outcome. Studies were classified to a level of evidence according to the system described by the Oxford Centre for EvidenceBased Medicine. RESULTS: Eighteen (18) studies were identified as providing information to answer the proposed question, one as level 3, 10 as level 4 and seven as level 5 evidence. Only one study compared two treatments, the remaining were prospective or retrospective case series of a single treatment intervention. Study design was highly variable with respect to population size, followup and outcome assessment, making direct comparison difficult, and metaanalysis was not applied. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, the evidence for improved outcome of one proposed treatment over another proposed treatment for keratomalacia in dogs and/or cats is very weak.},

On September 21, 2017, we identified relevant studies using 12 databases. The estimates of the included studies were pooled as a risk ratio (RR). We conducted a network and pairwise random-effects meta-analysis for both direct and indirect comparisons of different organisms that are known to cause diarrhea. The primary and secondary analysis outcomes were clinical response until cessation of illness, parasitological response and adverse events. We included 18 studies in our analysis. In cryptosporidiosis, the overall estimate favored nitazoxanide in its clinical response in comparison with placebo RR 1.46 [95\% CI 1.22-1.74; P-value {\textless}0.0001]. Network meta-analysis among patients with Giardia intestinalis showed an increase in the probability of diarrheal cessation and parasitological responses in comparison with placebo, RR 1.69 [95\% CI 1.08-2.64, P-score 0.27] and RR 2.91 [95\% CI 1.72-4.91, P-score 0.55] respectively. In Clostridium difficile infection, the network meta-analysis revealed a non-significantly superior clinical response effect of nitazoxanide to metronidazole 31 days after treatment RR 1.21 [95\% CI 0.87-1.69, P-score 0.26]. In Entamoeba histolytica, the overall estimate significantly favored nitazoxanide in parasitological response with placebo RR 1.80 [95\% CI 1.35-2.40, P-value {\textless} 0.001]. We highlighted the effectiveness of nitazoxanide in the cessation of diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium, Giardia intestinalis and Entamoeba histolytica infection. We also found significant superiority of NTZ to metronidazole in improving the clinical response to G. intestinalis, thus it may be a suitable candidate for treating infection-induced diarrhea. To prove the superiority of NTZ during a C. difficile infection may warrant a larger-scale clinical trial since its superiority was deemed insignificant. We recommend nitazoxanide as an appropriate option for treating infectious diarrhea.},

The present work provides a comprehensive review of the available literature concerning the anti-inflammatory properties of crocin in various organs/systems as well as its anti-nociceptive effects. PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases were systematically searched up to 28 March 2020 to detect all relevant preclinical and human studies in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. In total, 104 studies were included for qualitative synthesis. This systematic search and review indicated that crocin not only combats reactive oxygen species production and suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion but also alleviates inflammation in various organs (e.g. the lung, heart, brain, and kidney), in a series of animal models and in vitro experiments, via regulating mainly NF-B pathway and NF-Bp65 translocation to the cell nucleus. In this context, modulation of PI3K/Akt appears to be a favorable crocin target contributing to NF-B pathway inhibition. Even though data is limited in humans with only one clinically relevant study retrieved, the results of preclinical studies regarding anti-inflammatory/anti-nociceptive effects of crocin are promising and warrant further testing in clinical settings.},

Despite the present evidence showing spontaneous remyelination after TSCI the cellular origin of new myelin and the time course of the axon ensheathment/remyelination remained controversial issue. In this systematic review the trend of oligodendrocyte death after injury as well as the extent and the cellular origin of oligodendrogliogenesis were comprehensively evaluated. The study design was based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)-guided systematic review. PubMed and EMBASE were searched with no temporal or linguistic restrictions. Also, hand-search was performed in the bibliographies of relevant articles. Non-interventional animal studies discussing different types of myelinating cells including oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) were evaluated. The extent of oligodendrocyte death, oligodendrocyte differentiation and remyelination were the pathophysiological outcome measures. We found 12,359 studies, 34 of which met the inclusion criteria. The cumulative evidence shows extensive oligodendrocytes cell death during the first week post-injury (pi). OPCs and peripheral invading Schwann cells are the dominant cells contributing in myelin formation. The maximum OPC proliferation was observed at around 2 weeks pi and oligodendrogliogenesis continues at later stages until the number of oligodendrocytes return to normal tissue by one month pi. Taken together, the evidence in animals reveals the potential role for endogenous myelinating cells in the axon ensheathment/remyelination after TSCI and this can be the target of pharmacotherapy to induce oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin formation post-injury.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study design was based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)-guided systematic review. PubMed and EMBASE were searched (24 October, 2015) with no temporal or linguistic restrictions. Hand-search was performed in the bibliographies of relevant articles. Non-interventional animal studies evaluating time-dependent neuronal death following acute mechanical trauma to the spinal cord were included. We separately evaluated the fate of various populations of neurons including propriospinal neurons, ventral motor neurons, Clarke's column neurons, and supraspinal neurons. RESULTS: We found 11,557 non-duplicated studies. Screening through the titles and abstracts led to 549 articles, 49 of which met the inclusion criteria. Both necrotic and apoptotic neuronal deaths occur after TSCI, though necrosis is the prominent mechanism. There are differences in the responses of intrinsic neurons of the spinal cord to the TSCI. Also, the extent of neuronal death in the supraspinal neurons depends on the anatomical location of their axons. CONCLUSION: In order to develop new therapies, selection of the injury model and time of intervention has a crucial role in the efficacy of therapy. In addition, examining the safety and efficacy of an intervention by reliable methods not confounded by the injury-related changes would promote translation of therapies to the clinical application.},

	abstract = {This study systematically reviews the peer-reviewed literature on livestock production and food security in urbanizing environments of developing countries to synthesize the existing evidence and identify priorities for future research. Specifically, a systematic literature review was undertaken using PubMed, ISI Web of Science and Scopus databases over the period 1980-2017, resulting in a final number of 72 articles meeting our selection criteria. The results revealed a fragmentation in the literature, which draws from a very small number of studies, and is positioned in widely varied research areas, environments, livestock systems and consumption patterns. With such heterogeneity, drawing generalizations from the literature may be unreachable. Furthermore, the literature is largely qualitative in nature, with very few comprehensive models to capture and integrate empirical evidence. Food security was typically found to be narrowly defined, focusing primarily on interlinks with livestock supply. Considerably less attention has been given to other relevant dimensions of food security, such as accessibility, utilization and stability. Another important finding of relevance to food security is a need to address the "missing middle" in livestock value chains since the literature has customarily concentrated extensively on the two ends of the livestock value chain, i.e., on production and consumption, while widely ignoring other elements and actors along the value chain. A further focus on the interrelationships between livestock production, food security and urbanization in developing countries through a holistic and interdisciplinary approach is recommended. Particularly, future research aiming to understand livestock systems in the context of rapid urbanization should put more emphasis on addressing the full continuum of the livestock value chain and the four dimensions that drive food security in developing countries and how they possibly interrelate.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cryptosporidium spp. are causative agents of gastrointestinal diseases in a wide variety of vertebrate hosts. Mortality resulting from the disease is low in livestock, although severe cryptosporidiosis has been associated with fatality in young animals. METHODS: The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to review the prevalence and molecular data on Cryptosporidium infections in selected terrestrial domestic and wild ungulates of the families Bovidae (bison, buffalo, cattle, goat, impala, mouflon sheep, sheep, yak), Cervidae (red deer, roe deer, white-tailed deer), Camelidae (alpaca, camel), Suidae (boar, pig), Giraffidae (giraffes) and Equidae (horses). Data collection was carried out using PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct and Cochran databases, with 429 papers being included in this systematic analysis. RESULTS: The results show that overall 18.9\% of ungulates from the investigated species were infected with Cryptosporidium spp. Considering livestock species (cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, horses and buffaloes), analysis revealed higher Cryptosporidium infection prevalence in ungulates of the Cetartiodactyla than in those of the Perissodactyla, with cattle (29\%) being the most commonly infected farm animal. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the investigated domestic ungulates are considered potential sources of Cryptosporidium contamination in the environment. Control measures should be developed to reduce the occurrence of Cryptosporidium infection in these animals. Furthermore, literature on wild populations of the named ungulate species revealed a widespread presence and potential reservoir function of wildlife.},

	abstract = {Poultry production has significantly increased worldwide, along with the number of avian influenza (AI) outbreaks and the potential threat for human pandemic emergence. The role of wild bird movements in this global spread has been extensively studied while the role of animal, human and fomite movement within commercial poultry production and trade networks remains poorly understood. The aim of this work is to better understand these roles in relation to the different routes of AI spread. A scoping literature review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) using a search algorithm combining twelve domains linked to AI spread and animal/human movements within poultry production and trade networks. Only 28 out of 3,978 articles retrieved dealt especially with the role of animal, human and fomite movements in AI spread within the international trade network (4 articles), the national trade network (8 articles) and the production network (16 articles). While the role of animal movements in AI spread within national trade networks has been largely identified, human and fomite movements have been considered more at risk for AI spread within national production networks. However, the role of these movements has never been demonstrated with field data, and production networks have only been partially studied and never at international level. The complexity of poultry production networks and the limited access to production and trade data are important barriers to this knowledge. There is a need to study the role of animal and human movements within poultry production and trade networks in the global spread of AI in partnership with both public and private actors to fill this gap.},

The aim of the current paper is to systematically review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the effectiveness of AAT for schizophrenia and related disorders. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, CAB Abstracts, and Web of Science for RCTs of AAT for schizophrenia and related disorders. Primary outcomes were mental state and behaviour, clinical global response, and quality of life and wellbeing. Studies were eligible if they were RCTs that had compared AAT, or other animal-assisted intervention, to any control group using any participants with a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia (or related disorder), regardless of age, gender, setting, or severity and duration of illness. Seven studies were identified for the review. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity of studies, including marked differences in outcome measures and interventions. Five out of seven studies included symptoms as an outcome measure, with one reporting improvements in negative symptoms and one study reporting improvements in positive and emotional symptoms. The remaining studies reported no significant effects of AAT. Three studies included quality of life as an outcome measure but did not find any significant effects. Two studies did, however, report improvements in various measures of self-view. The use of AAT for schizophrenia remains inconclusive and there is currently not enough evidence to draw any firm conclusions due to heterogeneity of studies, risk of bias, and small samples. Rigorous, large-scale RCTs are needed to assess the true impact of AAT on schizophrenia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mitochondria are essential organelles that provide energy for cellular functions, participate in cellular signaling and growth, and facilitate cell death. Based on their multifactorial roles, mitochondria are also critical in the progression of critical illnesses. Transplantation of mitochondria has been reported as a potential promising approach to treat critical illnesses, particularly ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). However, a systematic review of the relevant literature has not been conducted to date. Here, we systematically reviewed the animal and human studies relevant to IRI to summarize the evidence for mitochondrial transplantation. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane library, and Embase and performed a systematic review of mitochondrial transplantation for IRI in both preclinical and clinical studies. We developed a search strategy using a combination of keywords and Medical Subject Heading/Emtree terms. Studies including cell-mediated transfer of mitochondria as a transfer method were excluded. Data were extracted to a tailored template, and data synthesis was descriptive because the data were not suitable for meta-analysis. RESULTS: Overall, we identified 20 animal studies and two human studies. Among animal studies, 14 (70\%) studies focused on either brain or heart IRI. Both autograft and allograft mitochondrial transplantation were used in 17 (85\%) animal studies. The designs of the animal studies were heterogeneous in terms of the route of administration, timing of transplantation, and dosage used. Twelve (60\%) studies were performed in a blinded manner. All animal studies reported that mitochondrial transplantation markedly mitigated IRI in the target tissues, but there was variation in biological biomarkers and pathological changes. The human studies were conducted with a single-arm, unblinded design, in which autologous mitochondrial transplantation was applied to pediatric patients who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for IRI-associated myocardial dysfunction after cardiac surgery. CONCLUSION: The evidence gathered from our systematic review supports the potential beneficial effects of mitochondrial transplantation after IRI, but its clinical translation remains limited. Further investigations are thus required to explore the mechanisms of action and patient outcomes in critical settings after mitochondrial transplantation.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Helminthiases are a group of disabling neglected tropical diseases that affect billions of people worldwide. Current control methods use preventative chemotherapy but reinfection is common and an inter-sectoral approach is required if elimination is to be achieved. Household and community scale water treatment can be used to provide a safe alternative water supply for contact activities, reducing exposure to WASH (water, sanitation, and hygiene) -related helminths. With the introduction of ultraviolet light emitting diodes (UV-C LEDs), ultraviolet (UV) disinfection could be a realistic option for water treatment in low-income regions in the near future, to provide safe alternative water supplies for drinking and contact activities such as handwashing, bathing, and laundry, but currently there is no guidance for the use of UV or solar disinfection against helminths. METHODOLOGY: A qualitative systematic review of existing literature was carried out to establish which WASH-related helminths are more susceptible to UV disinfection and identify gaps in research to inform future studies. The search included all species that can infect humans and can be transmitted through water or wastewater. Five online databases were searched and results were categorized based on the UV source: sunlight and solar simulators, UV-A and UV-B (long wavelength) sources, and UV-C (germicidal) sources. CONCLUSIONS: There has been very little research into the UV sensitivity of helminths; only 47 studies were included in this review and the majority were carried out before the standard protocol for UV disinfection experiments was published. Only 18 species were studied; however all species could be inactivated by UV light. Fluences required to achieve a 1-log inactivation ranged from 5 mJ/cm2 to over 800 mJ/cm2. Larval forms were generally more sensitive to UV light than species which remain as an egg in the environment. This review confirms that further research is required to produce detailed recommendations for household or community scale UV-C LED or solar disinfection (SODIS) of water for preventing helminthiases.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0197658},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) urgently requires effective treatment. Bleomycin-induced lung injury models are characterized by initial inflammation and secondary fibrosis, consistent with the pathological features of IPF. Human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) exhibit good differentiation potential and paracrine activity and are thus ideal for cell-based clinical therapies. The therapeutic effects of hAECs on lung fibrosis are attributed to many factors. We performed a systematic review of preclinical studies investigating the treatment of pulmonary fibrosis with hAECs to provide suggestions for their clinical use. METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched for original studies describing hAEC therapy in animal bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis models. After quality assessments, the number and species of experimental animals, bleomycin dose, hAEC source and dosage, time and route of administration of transplanted cells in animals, and time animals were euthanized in nine controlled preclinical studies were summarized. Ashcroft scores, lung collagen contents, inflammatory cells and cytokines were quantitatively and/or qualitatively analyzed in this review. Publication bias was also assessed. RESULTS: Each of the nine preclinical studies have unique characteristics regarding hAEC use. Ashcroft scores and lung collagen contents were decreased following hAEC transplantation in bleomycin-injured mice. Histopathology was also improved in most studies following treatment with hAECs. hAECs modulated macrophages, neutrophils, T cells, dendritic cells and the mRNA or protein levels of cytokines associated with inflammatory reactions (tumor necrosis factor-α, transforming growth factor-β, interferon-γ and interleukin) in lung tissues of bleomycin-injured mice. CONCLUSIONS: hAECs alleviate and reverse the progression of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice and may represent a new clinical treatment for IPF. hAECs exert anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects by modulating macrophage, neutrophil, T cell, dendritic cell and related cytokine levels in mice with bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis. Cell generation and the route, source and timing of hAEC transplantation all determine the therapeutic effectiveness of hAECs.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Paraquat (PQ) poisoning can cause multiple organ failure, in which the lung is the primary target organ. There is currently no treatment for PQ poisoning. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which differentiate into multiple cell types, have generated much enthusiasm regarding their use for the treatment of several diseases. The aim of this study was to systematically review and analyze published preclinical studies describing MSC administration for the treatment of PQ poisoning in animal models to provide a basis for cell therapy. METHODS: The electronic databases PubMed and CBMdisc were searched in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The MSC treatment characteristics of animal models of PQ poisoning were summarized. After quality assessment was performed, the effects of MSC transplantation were evaluated based on the survival rate, lung wet/dry weight, fibrosis scores, oxidative stress response, and inflammatory response. Publication bias was assessed. RESULTS: Eleven controlled preclinical studies involving MSC transplantation in animal models of PQ poisoning were included in this review. MSC therapy improved the survival rate and reduced the lung wet/dry weight and histopathological fibrosis changes in most studies. MSCs decreased serum or plasma malondialdehyde levels in the acute phase after 7 and 14 d and increased serum or plasma superoxide dismutase and glutathione levels at the same time points. IL-1β, TNF-α and TGF-β1 levels in blood or lung tissues were decreased to different degrees by MSCs. Lung hydroxyproline was decreased by MSCs after 14 d. No obvious evidence of publication bias was found. CONCLUSION: MSCs showed anti-fibrosis therapeutic effects in animal models of lung injury caused by PQ poisoning, which may be related to reduced oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine levels. Our review indicates a potential therapeutic role for MSC therapy to treat PQ poisoning and serves to augment the rationale for clinical studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Acute liver failure (ALF) has a high mortality varying from 80\% to 85\% with rapid progress in multi-organ system failure. Bioartificial liver (BAL) support systems have the potential to provide temporary support to bridge patients with ALF to liver transplantation or spontaneous recovery. In the past decades, several BAL support systems have been conducted in clinical trials. More recently, concerns have been raised on the renovation of high-quality cell sources and configuration of BAL support systems to provide more benefits to ALF models in preclinical experiments. AIM: To investigate the characteristics of studies about BAL support systems for ALF, and to evaluate their effects on mortality. METHODS: Eligible clinical trials and preclinical experiments on large animals were identified on Cochrane Library, PubMed, and EMbase up to March 6, 2019. Two reviewers independently extracted the necessary information, including key BAL indicators, survival and indicating outcomes, and adverse events during treatment. Descriptive analysis was used to identify the characteristics of the included studies, and a meta-analysis including only randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies was done to calculate the overall effect of BAL on mortality among humans and large animals, respectively. RESULTS: Of the 30 selected studies, 18 were clinical trials and 12 were preclinical experiments. The meta-analysis result suggested that BAL might reduce mortality in ALF in large animals, probably due to the recent improvement of BAL, including the type, cell source, cell mass, and bioreactor, but seemed ineffective for humans [BAL vs control: relative risk (95\% confidence interval), 0.27 (0.12-0.62) for animals and 0.72 (0.48-1.08) for humans]. Liver and renal functions, hematologic and coagulative parameters, encephalopathy index, and neurological indicators seemed to improve after BAL, with neither meaningful adverse events nor porcine endogenous retrovirus infection. CONCLUSION: BAL may reduce the mortality of ALF by bridging the gap between preclinical experiments and clinical trials. Clinical trials using improved BAL must be designed scientifically and conducted in the future to provide evidence for transformation.},

Tissue engineering (TE) is a promising alternative to current treatment options, where the TMJ is either left without functional components, or replaced with autogenous, allogeneic, or synthetic grafts. The objective of this systematic review was to answer the focused question: in experimental animal models, does the implantation of biomaterial scaffolds loaded with cells and/or growth factors (GFs) enhance regeneration of the discal or osteochondral TMJ tissues, compared with scaffolds alone, without cells, or GFs? Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines, electronic databases were searched for relevant controlled preclinical in vivo studies. Thirty studies reporting TMJ TE strategies in both small (rodents, rabbits; n = 25) and large animals (dogs, sheep, goats; n = 5) reporting histological and/or radiographic outcomes were included. Twelve studies reported ectopic (subcutaneous) implantation models in rodents, whereas 18 studies reported orthotopic, surgically induced defect models in large animals. On average, studies presented with an unclear-to-high risk of bias. In most studies, mesenchymal stem cells or chondrocytes were used in combination with either natural or synthetic polymer scaffolds, aiming for either TMJ disc or condyle regeneration. In summary, the overall preclinical evidence (ectopic [n = 6] and orthotopic TMJ models [n = 6]) indicate that addition of chondrogenic and/or osteogenic cells to biomaterial scaffolds enhances the potential for TMJ tissue regeneration. Standardization of animal models and quantitative outcome evaluations (biomechanical, biochemical, histomorphometric, and radiographic) in future studies, would allow more reliable comparisons and increase the validity of the results.},

Non-specified human taeniosis cases were described for Nigeria, Cameroon, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic Congo, Guinea, and Ivory Coast (seven out of 27 countries/territories), while T. saginata taeniosis specifically was only reported for Cameroon. Most prevalence estimates for taeniosis ranged between 0-11\%, while three studies from Nigeria reported prevalence estimates ranging between 23-50\%. None of the studies included molecular confirmation of the causative species. The presence of bovine cysticercosis was reported for Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic Congo, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, and Tristan da Cunha (14 out of 27 countries/territories). Prevalence estimates ranged between 0-29\%. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review has revealed that human taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis are seriously understudied in West and Central Africa. The high prevalence estimates of both conditions suggest an active dissemination of this parasite in the region, calling for a concerted One Health action from public health, veterinary health and food surveillance sectors.},

	abstract = {A variety of antimicrobials and antiparasitics are used to treat British cattle and sheep to ensure animal welfare, a safe food supply, and maintain farm incomes. However, with increasing global concern about antimicrobial resistance in human and animal populations, there is increased scrutiny of the use of antimicrobials in food-producing animals. This systematic review sought to identify and describe peer and non-peer reviewed sources, published over the last ten years, detailing the usage of, and resistance to, antimicrobials and antiparasitics in sheep and cattle farming systems in Britain as well as identify knowledge gaps. Applying the PRISMA review protocol and guidelines for including grey literature; Scopus, Web of Science, Medline, and government repositories were searched for relevant articles and reports. Seven hundred and seventy titles and abstracts and 126 full-text records were assessed, of which 40 scholarly articles and five government reports were included for data extraction. Antibiotic usage in sheep and cattle in Britain appear to be below the UK average for all livestock and tetracyclines and beta-lactam antibiotics were found to be the most commonly used. However, the poor level of coverage afforded to these species compared to other livestock reduced the certainty of these findings. Although resistance to some antibiotics (using Escherichia coli as a marker) appeared to have decreased in sheep and cattle in England and Wales over a five-year period (2013-2018), levels of resistance remain high to commonly used antibiotics. The small number and fragmented nature of studies identified by this review describing anthelmintic usage, and the lack of available national sales data, prevented the identification of trends in either sheep or cattle. We recommend that additional efforts are taken to collect farm or veterinary level data and argue that extraction of this data is imperative to the development of antimicrobial and antiparasitic resistance strategies in Britain, both of which are needed to reduce usage of these anti-infective agents, curb the development of resistance, and safeguard national agricultural production. Finally, metrics produced by this data should be generated in a way to allow for maximum comparability across species, sectors, and countries.},

The application of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) has been suggested as a novel treatment. In this paper, we present systematic reviews of pre-clinical and clinical studies of MSC therapy for second- or third(-)degree thermal burn wounds. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, the PubMed and Embase databases were searched, and interventional studies of MSC therapy using rodent models (21 studies) or human burn patients (three studies) were included in the pre-clinical and clinical reviews, respectively, where both overall outcome and wound-healing-phase-specific methodologies and effects were assessed. The pre-clinical studies demonstrated a promising effect of the application of MSCs on several wound healing phases. The clinical studies also suggested that the MSC treatment was beneficial, particularly in the remodeling phase. However, the limited number of studies, their lack of homogeneity in study design, relatively high risk of bias, lack of reporting on mode of action (MOA), and discontinuity of evidence restrict the strength of these findings. This comprehensive review presents an overview of available methodologies to assess the MOA of MSC treatment for distinct wound healing phases. Furthermore, it includes a set of recommendations for the design of high-quality clinical studies that can determine the efficacy of MSCs as a therapy for burn wounds.},

Mechanisms of action of both methods, however, remain largely elusive. Within this paper, we focus on animal-based experiments in order to investigate the biological mechanisms that are involved in alleviating pain by use of TMS and/or iMCS. Therefore, this paper systematically reviewed the animal-based evidence on these mechanisms. Multiple online databases were systematically searched and retrieved articles were assessed using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Twenty-three suitable articles were included; six on TMS and seventeen on iMCS. In general, iMCS and TMS were found to impact the primary motor cortex structure and function in animals. Furthermore, structural and functional changes within the thalamus, striatum, periaqueductal grey, rostral ventromedial medulla and dorsal horn were reported to occur. Although widespread, all areas in which structural and functional changes occurred after TMS and iMCS have been found to be interconnected anatomically. This could provide a rationale for future investigations of treating neuropathic pain by use of neuromodulation.},

	abstract = {Based on their performance-enhancing potential, caffeine and theophylline are prohibited substances in equine sports. Residues in horses can be caused by wilful application or by unintended uptake of contaminated feed. The International Federation of Horseracing Authorities recently introduced international residue limits (IRLs) to facilitate the discrimination between pharmacological relevant and irrelevant concentrations in doping samples. The objective of this study was to investigate the scientific validity of these IRLs. A systematic analysis was performed to assess the IRLs by different statistical approaches using published pharmacokinetic data. 31 out of 218 potentially relevant publications met the inclusion criteria. Thereby, both IRLs were found to be appropriate for the exclusion of the presence of a relevant pharmacological effect after a wilful application. The IRL of theophylline was also determined to be suitable for the prevention of positive doping tests caused by the ingestion of contaminated feed. In contrast, the IRL of caffeine is not suitable to prevent positive doping test caused by the ingestion of more than 10 mg caffeine per day per horse with contaminated feed. The lack of corresponding regulation for paraxanthine, a major active metabolite of caffeine and theophylline, was recognised as a substantial shortcoming of the current system, rendering both IRLs incomplete.},

Our aim was to conduct a systematic review of clinical and preclinical studies that evaluated biological augmentation of graft healing in ACLR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all, 1879 studies were identified across three databases. Following assessment against strict criteria, 112 studies were included (20 clinical studies; 92 animal studies). RESULTS: Seven categories of biological interventions were identified: growth factors, biomaterials, stem cells, gene therapy, autologous tissue, biophysical/environmental, and pharmaceuticals. The methodological quality of animal studies was moderate in 97\%, but only 10\% used clinically relevant outcome measures. The most interventions in clinical trials target the graft-tunnel interface and are applied intraoperatively. Platelet-rich plasma is the most studied intervention, but the clinical outcomes are mixed, and the methodological quality of studies was suboptimal. Other biological therapies investigated in clinical trials include: remnant-augmented ACLR; bone substitutes; calcium phosphate-hybridized grafts; extracorporeal shockwave therapy; and adult autologus non-cultivated stem cells. CONCLUSION: There is extensive preclinical research supporting the use of biological therapies to augment ACLR. Further clinical studies that meet the minimum standards of reporting are required to determine whether emerging biological strategies will provide tangible benefits in patients undergoing ACLR.

	abstract = {Objectives. Dracocephalum has over 60 species and is found mainly in the temperate regions of Asia and Europe. One of these species, i.e., Dracocephalum kotschyi Boiss, is known to have a number of medicinal properties and active ingredients in many parts of the world. Despite being an endemic wild-flowering plant of great importance, the plant is currently considered endangered in Iran. Besides, there is paucity of information on the significance of the medicinal properties and active constituents of D. kotschyi among the Iranian people. On that account a systematic review of studies reporting on the medicinal properties and active ingredients and its significance to human and animal health was conducted and the existing knowledge gaps were identified. Methods. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used in the search for published articles on medicinal properties and active ingredients of D. kotschyi and its significance on humans and animals in Iran. The search was confined to scientific articles from repositories of popular data bases and search engines among them PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Science Direct, SpringerLink, and Scopus. The search narrowed down on scientific journals, books, and book chapters focusing on the medicinal properties of D. kotschyi in Iran for the period between 1970 and 2018. Results. A total of 1158 scientific articles were sourced from the various databases, out of which 38 met the search criteria and qualified for this review. The studies were conducted in only 9 of the 31 provinces of Iran, with a large proportion in Isfahan province, central Iran. The studies showed that all plant parts (roots, aerial parts, flowers, and leaves) had active constituents. Essential oils and aerial plant parts were the main components studied. Nevertheless, the most frequently reported constituents were xanthomicrol, limonene, luteolin, geranial, apigenin, and calycopterin. A number of medicinal properties were reported among them antioxidant, antibacterial, anticancerous, antinociceptive, antihyperlipidemic, antispasmodic, cytotoxic, and immunomodulatory effects. The plant was also reported to be a remedy for inflammatory pain, headaches, congestion, liver disorders, ulcer, fever, renal pain, dyspepsia, stomach ache, abdominal pain, joints pains, muscle spasm, congestion, bloating, and wound healing effects, among others. Conclusion. This review has shown that D. kotschyi is an important medicinal plant with a large number of active constituents and great potential to safeguard human and animal health in Iran. However, over utilization of the D. kotschyi plant is already endangering its existence. Nevertheless, more studies need be conducted across the country.},

	abstract = {In the present meta-analysis, reductions in the risk of hip fracture with milk consumption were only observed among American adults, but not among Scandinavian adults, possibly because milk products are more commonly fortified with vitamin D in the former population than in Scandinavian countries. The reduction in the risk of hip fracture was also observed with yogurt consumption, which is often associated with healthy lifestyles and dietary patterns that contribute to improved bone health. INTRODUCTION: Although dairy products contain bone-beneficial nutrients, the association between dairy consumption and the risk of hip fracture remains equivocal. Fueling this uncertainty, the elevated risk of hip fracture in association with milk consumption was observed in a cohort of Swedish women. A systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies was performed to critically evaluate the association, or lack thereof, between dairy consumption (milk, yogurt, and cheese) and the risk of hip fracture. METHODS: A random effects model was used to generate the summary relative risks (RRs) with their 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations of interest. RESULTS: In the meta-analysis of the highest versus lowest category of consumption, higher consumption of yogurt (RR 0.78, 95\% CI 0.68, 0.90), but not milk (RR 0.86, 95\% CI 0.73, 1.02) or cheese (RR 0.85, 95\% CI 0.66, 1.08), was associated with a lower risk of hip fracture. For milk, the reduced risk of fracture with higher milk consumption was observed in the USA (RR 0.75, 95\% CI 0.65, 0.87), but not in Scandinavian countries (RR 1.00, 95\% CI 0.85, 1.17). These findings were further supported by the fact that American studies (RR 0.93, 95\% CI 0.88, 0.98; per 1 glass/day), but not Scandinavian studies (RR 1.01, 95\% CI 0.95, 1.07; per 1 glass/day), demonstrated a linear association between milk consumption and the risk of hip fracture. CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative evidence from prospective cohort studies reassuringly suggests that the risk of hip fracture may not be elevated among people who consume milk, yogurt, and cheese, and that a greater consumption of milk or yogurt may even be associated with a lower risk of hip fracture depending on the factors that may differ across the population of interest.},

	abstract = {Background: Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne virus transmitted by mosquitoes from the Aedes genus. The virus, endemic to parts of Asia and Africa, has recently undergone an emergence in other parts of the world where it was previously not found including Indian Ocean Islands, Europe, the Western Pacific and the Americas. There is no vaccine against chikungunya virus, which means that prevention and mitigation rely on personal protective measures and community level interventions including vector control. Methodology/Principal findings: A systematic review (SR) was conducted to summarize the literature on individual and community mitigation and control measures and their effectiveness. From a scoping review of the global literature on chikungunya, there were 91 articles that investigated mitigation or control strategies identified at the individual or community level. Of these, 81 were confirmed as relevant and included in this SR. The majority of the research was published since 2010 (76.5\%) and was conducted in Asia (39.5\%). Cross sectional studies were the most common study design (36.6\%). Mitigation measures were placed into six categories: behavioural protective measures, insecticide use, public education, control of blood and blood products, biological vector control and quarantine of infected individuals. The effectiveness of various mitigation measures was rarely evaluated and outcomes were rarely quantitative, making it difficult to summarize results across studies and between mitigation strategies. Meta-analysis of the proportion of individuals engaging in various mitigation measures indicates habitat removal is the most common measure used, which may demonstrate the effectiveness of public education campaigns aimed at reducing standing water. Conclusions/Significance: Further research with appropriate and consistent outcome measurements are required in order to determine which mitigation measures, or combination of mitigation measures, are the most effective at protecting against exposure to chikungunya virus.},

TYPE: Systematic review. LITERATURE SURVEY: A comprehensive search of studies was performed in 4 electronic databases (Cochrane, PubMed, PEDro, and Web of Science) regarding the effects of equine-assisted therapies and horse riding simulation exercise in older adults. Eight articles were selected, 5 of them focused on hippotherapy, 2 on horse riding simulation, and a single article that used the 2 types of therapy. METHODOLOGY: PRISMA guidelines were followed for the data extraction process. SYNTHESIS: The studies were all randomized controlled trials, but not double-blind, so they were classified as level of evidence B. Duration of hippotherapy programs ranged from 8-12 weeks. Sessions lasted between 15 and 60 minutes and were performed 2-5 times per week. Interventions using a horse simulator spanned 8 weeks and were conducted for 20 minutes 5 times per week. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that hippotherapy might improve balance, mobility, gait ability, and muscle strength, as well as could induce hormonal and cerebral activity changes in healthy older adults. Benefits of horse riding simulation could be limited to physical fitness and muscular activity. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: I.},

Recent trials have suggested that its effect on long-term functional outcome is neutral or negative, despite apparently promising pre-clinical data. Systematic review and meta-analysis is a useful tool to collate experimental data and investigate the basis of its conclusions. We searched three online databases to identify studies testing systemic hypothermia as monotherapy for treatment of animals subjected to a TBI. Data pertaining to TBI paradigm, animal subjects, and hypothermia management were extracted as well as those relating to risk of bias. We pooled outcome data where sufficient numbers allowed and investigated heterogeneity in neurobehavioral outcomes using multi-variate meta-regression. We identified 90 publications reporting 272 experiments testing hypothermia in animals subject to TBI. The subjects were mostly small animals, with well-established models predominating. Target temperature was comparable to clinical trial data but treatment was initiated very early. Study quality was low and there was some evidence of publication bias. Delay to treatment, comorbidity, and blinded outcome assessment appeared to predict neurobehavioral outcome on multi-variate meta-regression. Therapeutic hypothermia appears to be an efficacious treatment in experimental TBI, which differs from the clinical evidence. The pre-clinical literature showed limitations in quality and design and these both appeared to affect neurobehavioral experiment outcome. These should be acknowledged when designing and interpreting pre-clinical TBI studies in the future.},

	abstract = {Sports-related head trauma has emerged as an important public health issue, as mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) may result in neurodegenerative disorders such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Research into mTBI and CTE pathophysiology are difficult to undertake in athletes, with observational trials and post-mortem analysis the current mainstays. Thus, animal models play an important role in the study of mTBI, however, traditional animal models have focused on acute, severe injuries rather than the more typical mTBI's seen in sport injuries. Recently, a number of animal models have been developed that are both appropriately scaled and biomechanically relevant to the forces sustained by athletes. This review aimed to examine the literature for variables included in these animal models, and the resulting neurotrauma as evidenced by pathology and behavioral deficits. A systematic search of the literature was performed in multiple electronic databases. The inclusion criteria required mimicry of athlete mTBI conditions: freedom of head movement, lack of surgical alteration of the skull, and application of direct contact force. Studies were analyzed for variables including apparatus design features (impact force, change in animal head velocity, and kinetic energy transfer to the head), demonstrated pathology (phosphorylated tau, TDP-43 aggregation, diffuse axonal injury, gliosis, cytokine inflammation response, and genetic integrity), and behavioral changes. These studies suggested that appropriate animal models can assist in understanding the pathological and functional outcomes of athlete mTBI, and could be used as a platform for future studies of diagnostic/prognostic markers and in the development of treatment interventions.},

We conducted a systematic search of the relevant literature published from 1990 to 2017. Peer-reviewed articles were included if they reported the incidence of fatal or catastrophic musculoskeletal injury (CMI) in Thoroughbred flat races (n=21) or risk factors for CMI (n=65). Pooled effect sizes were estimated using the random-effects DerSimonian-Laird model. The pooled incidence of CMI was 1.17 (95\% confidence interval 0.90, 1.44) per 1000 race starts. Almost 300 factors have been investigated in epidemiological studies for potential associations with CMI. Factors found to have consistent evidence of increasing risk of CMI are: (1) Horse-level factors such as older horse age and age at first start, male sex, and higher race class or lower claiming price; (2) Race-level factors such as firmer track conditions on turf and wetter conditions on dirt, longer race distance, and a greater number of starters; and (3) Management-related factors including more time since previous start, greater number of starts, longer career length, issues identified at pre-race examination, previous injury, and recent administration of medication or injections. Studies investigating recent cumulative distance of high-speed exercise were conflicting and suggestive of at least two mechanisms of injury related to the accumulation of bone damage: (1) In well adapted bone following a period of intense training; and (2) In poorly adapted bone at relatively low levels of training intensity. Future studies should evaluate success of interventions and mechanisms for injury.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Low sanitary conditions characterize the rural and urban households in Sub-Saharan African region. Those environmental conditions propitiate the transmission of bacterial infections between animals and humans. Campylobacter spp. is a zoonotic bacterium and cause of human gastroenteritis worldwide, whose main symptom is diarrhea. It is normally found in the digestive tract of many farm animals as a commensal but some species cause diseases in animals. It is important to understand the occurrence of these bacteria in animals, as they may also play a role in transmission to humans. The main objective of this review was to describe the prevalence of Campylobacter in animals in Sub-Saharan Africa. We also report findings on antibiotic resistance. METHODS: We followed PRISMA guidelines to find studies about occurrence of Campylobacter spp. in animals in all countries from Sub-Saharan Africa. PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, African Index Medicus, African Journals Online, Google Scholar and Science Direct were searched for studies published between 2000 and 2019. RESULTS: We found 70 studies that described occurrence of Campylobacter spp. in animals in 18 out of 53 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa. Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli were the predominant species isolated. The majority of studies were found in Western Africa. Middle Africa had the lowest amount of data. Most records presented data from Nigeria (n = 25), South Africa (n = 14) and Tanzania (n = 11). Cattle and chickens appear to be important hosts and may be playing an important role in transmitting to humans. Most Campylobacter isolates were resistant to erythromycin (44\%), ampicillin (39\%), tetracycline (33\%), nalidixic acid (31\%) and ciprofloxacin (30\%). CONCLUSION: Several studies about Campylobacter spp. in animals have been published in the last 19 years but information on the epidemiology of campylobacteriosis is scarce in most Sub-Saharan African countries. Antibiotic resistance is an increasing concern in many countries. Measures should be taken to prevent infection by this pathogen in the region and to control antibiotic resistance.},

	abstract = {Synanthropic rodents are important urban pests that frequently carry hematophagous ectoparasites. These blood-sucking pests are capable of transmitting epizootic and zoonotic pathogens by landing on one host after feeding on an infected animal. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of ectoparasites carried by synanthropic rodents and discuss the pathogens that are associated with these external parasites. We searched relevant literatures using predefined criteria in the following databases: EMBASE, PUBMED, Web of Science and Scopus from January 2000 to June 2020. Quality of studies was evaluated using Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). Of 35 included studies from 15 countries in Africa, America, Asia, Europe and Oceania, black rats (R. rattus), brown rats (R. norvegicus), pacific rats (R. exulans) and house mice (Mus musculus) were common synanthropic rodents. Mites (Mesostigmata, Sarcoptiformes and Trombidiformes) were the most prevalent (42.6\%, 95\% CI 26-59.2), followed by ticks (Ixodida) (21.5\%, 95\% CI 10.5-32.6), lice (Phthiraptera) (17.8\%, 95\% CI 7.7-27.9) and fleas (Siphonaptera) (14.1\%, 95\% CI 10.1-18.1). Heterogeneity (I(2){\textgreater}96\%) across studies was statistically significant. The ectoparasitic fauna was shared considerably by different urban rodent species and appeared to be more diverse in R. rattus and R. norvegicus. Nonetheless, pathogens carried by these ectoparasites were rarely investigated. In conclusion, ectoparasites are ubiquitous in urban-dwelling rodents but our understanding of the epidemiology and the associated pathogens of these parasites remains limited. Further studies are warranted to unravel the pathogen landscape found in rodent-associated ectoparasites.},

DESIGN: Systematic review of experimental (non-human) studies assessing cognitive effects of RAS peptides angiotensin-(3-8) [Ang IV] and angiotensin-(1-7) [Ang-(1-7)] and their receptors, the Ang IV receptor (AT4R) and the Mas receptor. RESULTS: Of 450 articles identified, 32 met inclusion criteria. Seven of 11 studies of normal animals found Ang IV had beneficial effects on tests of passive or conditioned avoidance and object recognition. In models of cognitive deficit, eight of nine studies found Ang IV and its analogs (Nle(1)-Ang IV, dihexa, LVV-hemorphin-7) improved performance on spatial working memory and passive avoidance tasks. Two of three studies examining Ang-(1-7) found it benefited memory. Mas receptor removal was associated with reduced fear memory in one study. CONCLUSION: Studies of cognitive impairment show salutary effects of acute administration of Ang IV and its analogs, as well as AT4R activation. Brain RAS peptides appear most effective administered intracerebroventricularly, close to the time of learning acquisition or retention testing. Ang-(1-7) shows anti-dementia qualities.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Human psittacosis, caused by Chlamydia (C.) psittaci, is likely underdiagnosed and underreported, since tests for C. psittaci are often not included in routine microbiological diagnostics. Source tracing traditionally focuses on psittacine pet birds, but recently other animal species have been gaining more attention as possible sources for human psittacosis. This review aims to provide an overview of all suspected animal sources of human psittacosis cases reported in the international literature. In addition, for each animal species the strength of evidence for zoonotic transmission was estimated. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted using four databases (Pubmed, Embase, Scopus and Proquest). Articles were included when there was mention of at least one human case of psittacosis and a possible animal source. Investigators independently extracted data from the included articles and estimated strength of evidence for zoonotic transmission, based on a self-developed scoring system taking into account number of human cases, epidemiological evidence and laboratory test results in human, animals, and the environment. RESULTS: Eighty articles were included, which provided information on 136 different situations of possible zoonotic transmission. The maximum score for zoonotic transmission was highest for turkeys, followed by ducks, owls, and the category 'other poultry'. Articles reporting about zoonotic transmission from unspecified birds, psittaciformes and columbiformes provided a relatively low strength of evidence. A genotypical match between human and animal samples was reported twenty-eight times, including transmission from chickens, turkeys, guinea fowl, peafowl, pigeons, ducks, geese, songbirds, parrot-like birds and owls. CONCLUSIONS: Strong evidence exists for zoonotic transmission from turkeys, chickens and ducks, in addition to the more traditionally reported parrot-like animal sources. Based on our scoring system, the evidence was generally stronger for poultry than for parrot-like birds. Psittaciformes should not be disregarded as an important source of human psittacosis, still clinicians and public health officials should include poultry and birds species other than parrots in medical history and source tracing.},

However, other experiments produced nonsignificant results, leading some to argue either that earlier reports were mistaken, or that some queen pheromones only work in specific contexts. Here, I review the experimental evidence using meta-analysis, and show that there is near-universal support for the hypothesis that fertility-related chemicals cause sterility regardless of context; studies finding otherwise can be explained most parsimoniously as false negatives. Additionally, queen pheromone experiments that were not performed blind recorded much stronger effect sizes, suggesting bias. I conclude by highlighting several outstanding questions in the field, and by offering recommendations for future studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become an emerging issue in the developing countries as well as in Bangladesh. AMR is aggravated by irrational use of antimicrobials in a largely unregulated pluralistic health system. This review presents a 'snap shot' of the current situation including existing policies and practices to address AMR, and the challenges and barriers associated with their implementation. METHODS: A systematic approach was adopted for identifying, screening, and selecting relevant literature on AMR situation in Bangladesh. We used Google Scholar, Pubmed, and Biomed Central databases for searching peer-reviewed literature in human, animal and environment sectors during January 2010-August 2019, and Google for grey materials from the institutional and journal websites. Two members of the study team independently reviewed these documents for inclusion in the analysis. We used a 'mixed studies review' method for synthesizing evidences from different studies. RESULT: Of the final 47 articles, 35 were primary research, nine laboratory-based research, two review papers and one situation analysis report. Nineteen articles on human health dealt with prescribing and/or use of antimicrobials, five on self-medication, two on non-compliance of dosage, and 10 on the sensitivity and resistance patterns of antibiotics. Four papers focused on the use of antimicrobials in food animals and seven on environmental contamination. Findings reveal widespread availability of antimicrobials without prescription in the country including rise in its irrational use across sectors and consequent contamination of environment and spread of resistance. The development and transmission of AMR is deep-rooted in various supply and demand side factors. Implementation of existing policies and strategies remains a challenge due to poor awareness, inadequate resources and absence of national surveillance. CONCLUSION: AMR is a multi-dimensional problem involving different sectors, disciplines and stakeholders requiring a One Health comprehensive approach for containment.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Many animal studies have evaluated the role of vitamins in the recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury, but their results have been contradictory and no consensus has been reached. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effects of vitamin C and vitamin E on recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury in animal models. DATA SOURCES: Two authors independently collected the records of relevant articles published in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science through November 2018. STUDY SELECTION: All studies conducted in animal models to evaluate the therapeutic effects of vitamin C or vitamin E or both on recovery of motor function after spinal cord injury were included. Studies that lacked a control group or a standard treatment, lacked an assessment of motor function, included genetically modified/engineered animals, included animals pretreated with vitamin C or vitamin E, or combined vitamin treatment with other methods, such as cell therapies, were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION: Data from 10 articles met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis, conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. RESULTS: Daily supplementation with vitamin C (P {\textless} 0.0001) and vitamin E (P {\textless} 0.0001) significantly improved the recovery of motor function in animals affected by spinal cord injury. Vitamin C supplementation is effective only when administered intraperitoneally (P {\textless} 0.0001). Concurrent supplementation with both vitamins does not show better efficacy than treatment with either one alone. CONCLUSION: Administration of vitamin C and vitamin E in animal models of spinal cord injury significantly improves the recovery of motor function.},

	abstract = {The liver flukes, Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica, are common trematode parasites of livestock. F. hepatica is known to modulate the immune response, including altering the response to co-infecting pathogens. Bovine tuberculosis (bTB), caused by Mycobacterium bovis, is a chronic disease which is difficult to control and is of both animal welfare and public health concern. Previous research has suggested that infection with liver fluke may affect the accuracy of the bTB skin test, but direction of the effect differs between studies. In a systematic review of the literature, all experimental and observational studies concerning co-infection with these two pathogens were sought. Data were extracted on the association between fluke infection and four measures of bTB diagnosis or pathology, namely, the bTB skin test, interferon γ test, lesion detection and culture/bacterial recovery. Of a large body of literature dating from 1950 to 2019, only thirteen studies met the inclusion criteria. These included studies of experimentally infected calves, case control studies on adult cows, cross sectional abattoir studies and a herd level study. All the studies had a medium or high risk of bias. The balance of evidence from the 13 studies included in the review suggests that liver fluke exposure was associated with either no effect or a decreased response to all of the four aspects of bTB diagnosis assessed: skin test, IFN γ, lesion detection and mycobacteria cultured or recovered. Most studies showed a small and/or non-significant effect so the clinical and practical importance of the observed effect is likely to be modest, although it could be more significant in particular groups of animals, such as dairy cattle.},

	abstract = {Background: Rhein is considered to have beneficial influence on diabetic nephropathy. Animal experiments suggested that the mechanisms of rhein against diabetic nephropathy may involve many processes, but the credibility of the evidence is unclear. Therefore, we conducted systematic review and meta-analysis of pre-clinical animal data to assess the current evidence for rhein effects and mechanisms in treating diabetic nephropathy. Methods: The databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP information database, Wanfang Data Information Site, and Chinese Biomedical Literature were searched for this review. SYRCLE's risk of bias tool for animal studies was applied to assess the methodological quality of studies. A meta-analysis was performed according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions by using RevMan 5.3 and STATA/SE 12.0 software. This study was registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42018105220. Results: Twenty-five studies involving 537 animals were included. There was significant association of rhein with levels of blood glucose (P {\textless} 0.05), serum creatinine (Scr) (P {\textless} 0.05), urine protein (P {\textless} 0.05), kidney tubules injury index (P {\textless} 0.05), relative area of kidney collagen (P {\textless} 0.05), transforming growth factor-β(1) (P {\textless} 0.05), malondialdehyde (P {\textless} 0.05), and superoxide dismutase (P {\textless} 0.05) compared with that in the control group. No significant association between rhein and endothelin (P {\textgreater} 0.05) was found. Subgroup analysis showed that the hypoglycemic effect of rhein on type 2 diabetic nephropathy was better than on type 1 diabetic nephropathy (P {\textless} 0.05). Conclusions: These findings suggested that rhein has beneficial effects on animal models of diabetic nephropathy, and that the mechanisms are mostly involved with ameliorating levels of TGF-β(1), renal fibrosis, metabolism, and oxidative stress status. However, some factors such as possible publication bias, methodological quality, and sample size may affect the accuracy of positive findings. These limitations suggested that a cautious interpretation of the positive results of this systematic review and meta-analysis is necessary. Therefore, high methodological quality and well-reported animal experiments are needed in future research.},

METHODS: Articles were identified in PubMed, EMBASE and the Web of Science and were included if they evaluated the effect of IH on the changes in the infarcted area after AMI in rats. RESULTS: A preliminary search identified 3633 articles and 29 data sets from 23 articles (12 in vivo, 16 in vitro). The IS decreased after AMI in IH rats both in vitro (SMD -1.46, 95\% CI [- 2.37, - 0.55]; I(2) = 85.6\%, P = 0.000) and in vivo (SMD -1.43, 95\% CI [- 2.05, - 0.82], I(2) = 73.6\%, P = 0.000). Sensitivity analysis indicated that IH had a strong protective effect against myocardial infarction, and the hypoxia concentration was significantly correlated with the change in IS after AMI. CONCLUSION: IH can reduce IS after AMI in rats. This effect of IH may be related to the dose of hypoxia, and the oxygen concentration may be one of the most important influencing factors.},

However, the advantage of RVATS compared to VATS is still under investigation. The results are unclear. AIM: The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of Robot-assisted Thoracic Surgery (RATS) lobectomy versus Video-assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) for lobectomy in patients with Non- Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: A systematic electronic search of online electronic databases: Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane library updated in June 2017. The meta-analysis was performed including the studies are designed as randomized or non- randomized controlled. RESULTS: Twenty retrospective cohort studies met our inclusion criteria. The pooled analysis of mortality showed that RATS lobectomy significantly reduced the mortality rate when compared with VATS lobectomy (RR =0.53, 95\% CI 0.37 - 0.76; P = 0.0005). With the pooled result of duration of surgery indicated that RATS has a tendency towards longer surgery time (SMD= 0.52, 95\% CI 0.23- 0.81; P {\textless} 0.0004=). However, the meta-analysis on the median length of hospital stay (MD =0.00, 95\% CI -0.03 - 0.03; P = 0.91), number of dissected lymph nodes station (SMD =0.39, 95\% CI -0.60 - 1.38; P = 0.44), the number of removed lymph nodes (SMD =0.98, 95\% CI -0.61 - 2.56; P = 0.23), mean duration of drainage (SMD =0.29, 95\% CI -0.15 - 0.73; P = 0.20), prolonged air leak (RR =1.01, 95\% CI 0.84 - 1.21; P = 0.93), arrhythmia (RR =1.06, 95\% CI 0.88 - 1.26; P = 0.54) (P= 0.54), pneumonia (RR =0.89, 95\% CI 0.69 - 1.13; P = 0.33), the incidence of conversion (RR =0.82, 95\% CI 0.54 - 1.26; P = 0.37) and morbidity (RR =1.05, 95\% CI 0.90 - 1.23; P = 0.055) all showed no significant differences between RATS and VATS lobectomy. CONCLUSIONS: RATS result in better mortality as compared with VATS. However, robotics seems to have longer operative time and higher hospital costs, without superior advantages in morbidity rates and oncologic efficiency. Since the advantages of RATS has been performed in some area, the continuation of a comparative investigation with VATS may be necessary. And some efforts need to be taken into consideration to reduce the operative time and cost.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.envpol.2019.113306},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to particulate matters (PM) is recognized as an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. A change in cardiac autonomic function is one postulated mechanism leading to PM related cardiovascular events. This study therefore evaluated the associations of short-term exposure to PM and heart rate variability (HRV) parameters, which can reflect the cardiac autonomic function. METHODS: Four electronic databases were searched for controlled studies of rodents published prior to December 2018. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Effect sizes were calculated for five main HRV parameters, including standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN), square root of mean squared differences between successive normal-to-normal intervals (rMSSD), low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and the ratio of LF and HF (LF/HF). RESULTS: The review included 23 studies with 401 animals. Short-term exposure to PM by instillation yielded statistically significant effects on SDNN (Standardized Mean Difference [SMD] = -1.11, 95\% Confidence Intervals [CI] = -2.22 to -0.01, P = 0.05), LF (SMD = -1.19, 95\% CI = -1.99 to -0.40, P = 0.003) and LF/HF (SMD = -1.05, 95\% CI = -2.03 to -0.07, P = 0.04). Short-term exposure to PM by inhalation only yielded statistically significant effect on LF/HF (SMD = -0.83, 95\% CI = -1.39 to -0.27, P = 0.004). There was no evidence that animal model and exposure frequency influenced the relationship of PM and HRV. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exposure to PM can decrease HRV of rodents, affecting cardiac autonomic function. Exposure methods can influence the relationships of PM and HRV parameters. Further studies should focus on the effects of long-term PM exposure, on human beings, and potential influential factors of PM-HRV associations.},

However, the reported therapeutic efficacy was inconsistent among studies. To evaluate this situation, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched for preclinical studies using NSPC intraparenchymal transplantation in ischemic stroke animals. Data of study quality score, neurobehavioral (mNSS, rotarod test, and cylinder test) and histological (infarct volume) outcomes, cell therapy-related serious adverse events, and related cellular mechanisms were extracted for meta-analysis and systematic review. A total of 62 studies containing 73 treatment arms were included according to our criterion, with a mean quality score of 5.10 in 10. Among these studies, almost half of the studies claimed no adverse events of tumorigenesis. The finally pooled effect sizes for neurobehavioral and histological assessments were large (1.27 for mNSS, 1.63 for the rotarod test, 0.71 for the cylinder test, and 1.11 for infarct volume reduction). With further analysis, it was found that the administration time poststroke, NSPC donor species, and transplantation immunogenicity had close correlations with the degree of infarct volume reduction. The NSPC dosage delivered into the brain parenchyma was also negatively correlated with the effect of the cylinder test. Intriguingly, endogenous apoptosis inhibition and axonal regeneration played the most critical role in intraparenchymal NSPC transplantation among the cellular mechanisms. These results indicate that intraparenchymal NSPC transplantation is beneficial for neurobehavioral and histological improvement and is relatively safe for ischemic stroke animals. Therefore, intraparenchymal NSPC transplantation is a promising treatment for stroke patients.},

	abstract = {Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infects both humans and animals. Swine has been confirmed to be the principal natural reservoir, which raises a concern that HEV infection would be substantially increasing among swine workers. The present study calculated the pooled prevalence of IgG antibodies against HEV among swine workers and the general population in previous cross-sectional studies. We conducted a meta-analysis comparing the prevalence of HEV infection between swine workers and the general population, including local residents, blood donors and non-swine workers. Through searches in three databases (PubMed and OVID in English, and CNKI in Chinese) and after study selection, a total of 32 studies from 16 countries (from 1999 through 2018) were included in the meta-analysis. A random-effect model was employed in the study; an I (2) statistic assessed heterogeneity, and the Egger's test detected publication bias. The comparative prevalence of anti-HEV IgG was pooled from the studies. Compared to the general population, the prevalence ratio (PR) for swine workers was estimated to be 1.52 (95\% CI 1.38-1.76) with the I (2) being 71\%. No publication bias was detected (p = 0.40). A subgroup analysis further indicated increased prevalence of anti-HEV IgG in the swine workers in Asia (PR = 1.49, 95\% CI: 1.35-1.64), in Europe (PR = 1.93, 95\% CI: 1.49-2.50) and in all five swine-related occupations, including swine farmers, butchers, meat processors, pork retailers and veterinarians (PR ranged between 1.19 and 1.75). In summary, swine workers have a relatively higher prevalence of past HEV infection, and this finding is true across swine-related occupations, which confirms zoonotic transmission between swine and swine workers.},

	abstract = {Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is a disease with a high case-fatality rate that is caused by infection with the SFTS virus (SFTSV). Five electronic databases were systematically searched to identify relevant articles published from 1 January 2011 to 1 December 2019. The pooled rates with 95\% confidence interval (CI) were calculated by a fixed-effect or random-effect model analysis. The results showed that 92 articles were included in this meta-analysis. For the confirmed SFTS cases, the case-fatality rate was 0.15 (95\% CI 0.11, 0.18). Two hundred and ninety-six of 1384 SFTS patients indicated that they had been bitten by ticks and the biting rate was 0.21 (95\% CI 0.16, 0.26). The overall pooled seroprevalence of SFTSV antibodies among the healthy population was 0.04 (95\% CI 0.03, 0.05). For the overall seroprevalence of SFTSV in animals, the seroprevalence of SFTSV was 0.25 (95\% CI 0.20, 0.29). The infection rate of SFTSV in ticks was 0.08 (95\% CI 0.05, 0.11). In conclusion, ticks can serve as transmitting vectors of SFTSVs and reservoir hosts. Animals can be infected by tick bites, and as a reservoir host, SFTSV circulates continuously between animals and ticks in nature. Humans are infected by tick bites and direct contact with patient secretions.},

Studies show various biological effects of fasudil in the cardiovascular system. We conducted a preclinical systematic review to determine the efficacy and possible mechanisms of fasudil on animal models of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Nineteen studies involving 400 animals were identified after searching 8 databases for articles published till June 2018. The methodological quality was assessed by the Collaborative Approach to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies (CAMARADES) 10-item checklist. The data were analyzed using Rev-Man 5.3 software, and the score of study quality ranged from 3 to 6 points. Compared to the control group, fasudil treated animals showed reduced myocardial infarct size (P {\textless} 0.05), lower levels of cardiac enzymes (P {\textless} 0.05) and cardiac troponin T (P {\textless} 0.05), improved systolic and diastolic functions (P {\textless} 0.05), and increased degree of decline in the ST-segment (P {\textless} 0.05). The possible mechanisms of fasudil action against myocardial I/R injury are improvement in coronary vasodilation, inhibition of apoptosis and oxidative stress, relieving inflammation, and reduction in endoplasmic reticulum stress and metabolism. In conclusion, fasudil exerts a cardio-protective function through multiple signaling pathways in animal models of myocardial I/R injury.},

The aim of this systematic literature review (SLR) was to investigate the effect of companion animals (whether simply as pets or used in more formal intervention approaches) on the physical and mental health of older adults (aged 60+). METHODS: . The reviewers identified key search terms and conducted a systematic search of the PsycINFO and PubMed databases. The 70 articles reviewed were evaluated through tabular and thematic analysis. RESULTS: . In 52 of the studies examined, companion animals positively contributed to the mental and/or physical health of older adults. With respect to mental health, involvement with a companion animal improved participant quality of life and effectively attenuated symptoms of depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, and the behavioral and psychiatric symptoms of dementia (BPSD). In relation to physical health, marked increases in physical activity and improvements in blood pressure and heart rate variability were the only consistent physical health improvements observed from companion animal interactions. CONCLUSIONS: . Animal companionship can benefit the mental and physical health of older adults, although more and better controlled research on this topic is required. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: . Use of companion animals has the potential to be an effective treatment or adjunct therapy to improve the health status and quality of life of older individuals.},

	abstract = {There are several biological factors that might play a role in physiological response to opioids and/or the onset of problematic opioid use; however, sex-based differences in non-analgesic opioid-based effects are poorly understood. The goal of this review is to provide a current analysis of the pre-clinical literature on sex-based differences in response to endogenous and exogenous opioids, including the interplay between sex hormones and opioid receptor-mediated neuronal activity and associated behaviours. A systematic search was performed on the following terms within PubMed between March and April 2018: 'opioid oestrogen', 'opioid progesterone', 'opioid oestradiol', and 'opioid testosterone'. Pre-clinical research on the non-analgesic, sex-based effects of opioids is disparate, both in terms of methodology and outcomes, which prohibits a cohesive summary of the results. Themes from the pre-clinical literature suggest that opioid receptor binding, coupling, and density vary as a function of hormone exposure. Findings also suggest that interactions between endogenous opioid and stress systems may differ between males and females as a function of ovarian hormones. Given the current opioid-related public health crisis, there is a pressing need to increase systematic pre-clinical and clinical research on sex-based differences in opioid-effects and opioid use disorder.},

	abstract = {The objectives were to review the published literature and use meta-analytic methods to determine the effects of dietary protein fed prepartum on productive performance of dairy cows. The hypothesis was that responses to dietary protein prepartum would differ between nulliparous and parous cows, and performance would be maximized at a greater protein supply in nulliparous than in parous cows. The literature was systematically reviewed, searching randomized experiments in which the prepartum dietary content or degradability of protein was manipulated. Twenty-seven experiments including 125 treatment means and 1,801 cows were included in the meta-analysis. Of those, 8 experiments with 27 treatment means reported responses for 510 nulliparous cows. Data collected included the ingredient composition and chemical analyses of prepartum diets, parity group, and means and respective measures of variance for productive responses. Mixed model meta-analysis was conducted and statistical models investigated the effects of dietary crude protein (CP) or supply of metabolizable protein (MP) prepartum on performance. Supply of MP was predicted using the National Research Council Nutrient Requirements of Dairy Cattle (2001) model. The mean ± standard deviation and median (range) concentrations of dietary CP fed to cows prepartum were 14.4 ± 2.2 and 14.4\% (8.9 to 20.9\%), resulting in mean and median (range) intakes of CP prepartum of 1,720 ± 432 and 1,734 g/d (745 to 2,482 g/d). Predicted prepartum supply of MP averaged 822 ± 157 in nulliparous cows, ranging from 517 to 1,094 g/d, and 1,146 ± 316 in parous cows, ranging from 463 to 1,733 g/d. Increasing prepartum CP content or predicted supply of MP improved postpartum dry matter intake in nulliparous cows, but increasing prepartum CP content reduced prepartum dry matter intake in parous cows. Yields of milk and fat-corrected milk increased with increasing prepartum supply of MP in nulliparous but not in parous cows. Yields of fat and protein increased in nulliparous cows with increased CP content or supply of MP. Alternatively, in parous cows, yield of milk fat was not influenced by supply of MP but responded quadratically to dietary CP content and was maximized at approximately 14\% CP. Dietary CP had no effect on protein yield in parous cows, but increasing the supply of MP improved protein yield only in cows from experiments with {\textgreater}36 kg/d of milk production, whereas MP supply had no effect on protein yield of parous cows from experiments with {\textless}28 kg/d of milk production. Performance of dairy cows was responsive to prepartum supply of MP and nulliparous benefited from diets with increased MP intake. Based on current results, production responses for nulliparous cows increased linearly up to the maximum MP intake of 1,100 g/d observed in the study, whereas for parous cows, only yield of milk protein in cows producing more than 36 kg of milk/d was influenced by supplying more than 800 g/d of MP.},

	abstract = {Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, with advanced age being one of the major predictors of poor prognosis. To replicate the mechanisms and multifaceted complexities of human TBI and develop prospective therapeutic treatments, various TBI animal models have been developed. These models have been essential in furthering our understanding of the pathophysiology and biochemical effects on brain mechanisms following TBI. Despite these advances, translating preclinical results to clinical application, particularly in elderly individuals, continues to be challenging. This review aims to provide a clinical perspective, identifying relevant variables currently not replicated in TBI animal models, to potentially improve translation to clinical practice, especially as it applies to elderly populations. As background for this clinical perspective, we reviewed articles indexed on PubMed from 1970 to 2019 that used aged animal models for studying TBI. These studies examined end points relevant for clinical translation, such as neurocognitive effects, sensorimotor behavior, physiological mechanisms, and efficacy of neuroprotective therapies. However, compared with the higher incidence of TBI in older individuals, animal studies on the basic science of aging and TBI remain remarkably scarce. Moreover, a fundamental disconnect remains between experiments in animal models of TBI and successful translation of findings for treating the older TBI population. In this article, we aim to provide a clinical perspective on the unique attributes of TBI in older individuals and a critical appraisal of the research to date on TBI in aged animal models as well as recommendations for future studies.},

In reptiles, Chlamydia can cause hepatitis, pneumonitis, and conjunctivitis and it can cause high mortality in young animals. The objectives of this study were to estimate the pooled prevalence of chlamydial infections in reptiles and to assess the trend of these infections over time. Materials and Methods: The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Relevant studies were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The retrieved studies were screened for eligibility. Then, important data were extracted from the included studies. A random effects model was used for all analyses. Subgroup analysis was used to assess heterogeneity for orders of reptiles, continents where the studies were conducted, and types of specimens. Cumulative meta-analysis and meta-regression were used to determine the trend of the prevalence over time. The quality of each included study was evaluated. Results: Of 106 studies (with a total of 2607 samples), 20 met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of chlamydial infections in reptiles was 23.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 15.4-34.0). The trend of chlamydial infections increased from 1990 to 2008; thereafter, it was almost stable at slightly over 20\%. The most commonly reported Chlamydia spp. were Chlamydia psittaci, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Chlamydia pecorum, and Chlamydia caviae. Among reptiles, the prevalence of chlamydial infections was highest in crocodiles (57.3\% [95\% CI: 32.5-78.9]). Among continents, the prevalence of chlamydial infections was highest in Australia (68.6\% [95\% CI: 36.8-89.1]). Conclusions: Based on the included studies, the prevalence of chlamydial infections in reptiles was high, especially in crocodiles. Because C. psittaci and C. pneumoniae are commonly found in reptiles and are well-known zoonotic pathogens, they should be of concern for human health.},

Nascent research examining the interrelationship of malaria and the mammalian microbiome has yielded interesting insights inviting further study. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature examining associations between the microbiome and malaria in mammalian hosts. An electronic search algorithm was adapted to PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science, and reference lists of relevant sources were manually searched. Identified studies were screened and assessed independently by 2 authors, and results were compiled in a qualitative synthesis of the evidence. RESULTS: Ten relevant studies were identified. They demonstrate associations between certain intestinal communities and protection against Plasmodium infection and modulation of disease severity. Plasmodium infection acutely and reversibly reshapes gut microbial composition in mice. The makeup of human skin microbial communities may influence mosquito attraction and thus disease transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Early research supports a relationship between malaria and the microbiome. The evidence is incomplete, but the observed associations are evocative and signal a promising avenue of inquiry. Microbiome-based studies of malaria can be readily integrated into field-based research.},

Despite its importance in equine practice, available information regarding its epidemiology is limited. This systematic review aimed to assess published literature to evaluate available evidence regarding the clinical presentation, prevalence and risk factors for PPID in horses and ponies. Electronic database searches were undertaken using a range of terms, and English language publications published prior to August 2016 were included. Both authors independently reviewed screened papers for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed the quality of reporting using predefined criteria. Data were extracted using modified critically appraised topic data collection forms. Meta-analysis was not undertaken due to marked between-study variations. Following removal of duplicate records, of 358 published papers yielded by the search, 97 abstracts were screened for eligibility and 29 publications meeting inclusion criteria were included in the review. Most studies reviewed were case series or cross-sectional studies, with considerable variation in study populations and PPID case definition. Hypertrichosis and/or other hair coat abnormalities, laminitis and epaxial muscle wastage or muscle atrophy are the most frequently reported clinical signs, with prevalence of these signs increasing with increasing horse age. The most robust prevalence estimates for PPID were 21.2\% in horses and ponies aged ≥15 years and 2.9\% amongst the general equine population. Findings regarding breed and sex predispositions were equivocal and only increasing age has been identified as a significant risk factor for PPID.},

	abstract = {Rodents carry many ectoparasites, such as ticks, lice, fleas, and mites, which have potential public health importance. Middle Eastern countries are hotspots for many emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as plague, leishmaniasis, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, and Q fever, due to their ecological, socioeconomic, and political diversity. Rodent ectoparasites can act as vectors for many of these pathogens. Knowledge of rodent ectoparasites is of prime importance in controlling rodent ectoparasite-borne zoonotic diseases in this region. The current systematic review and meta-analysis performs a comprehensive synthesis of the available knowledge, providing an evidence-based overview of the ectoparasites detected on rodents in Middle Eastern countries. Following a systematic search in Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science, a total of 113 published articles on rodent ectoparasites were studied and analyzed. A total of 87 rodent species were documented, from which Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, and Rattus rattus were found to be the most common. Fleas were the most reported ectoparasites (87 articles), followed by mites (53), ticks (44), and lice (25). Xenopsylla cheopis, Polyplax spinulosa, Ornithonyssus bacoti, and Hyalomma rhipicephaloides were the most commonly described fleas, lice, mites, and ticks, respectively. Based on the reviewed articles, the median flea, louse, mite, and tick indices were highest in Israel (4.15), Egypt (1.39), Egypt (1.27), and Saudi Arabia (1.17), respectively. Quantitative meta-analysis, using a random-effects model, determined the overall pooled flea prevalence in the Middle East as 40\% (95\% CI: 25-55, I(2) = 100\%, p {\textless} 0.00001), ranging between 13\% (95\% CI: 0-30, I(2) = 95\%, p {\textless} 0.00001) in Iran and 59\% (95\% CI: 42-77, I(2) = 75\%, p {\textless} 0.00001) in Israel. The overall pooled louse prevalence was found to be 30\% (95\% CI: 13-47, I(2) = 100\%, p {\textless} 0.00001), ranging between 25\% in Iran (95\% CI: 1-50, I(2) = 99\%) and 38\% in Egypt (95\% CI: 7-68, I(2) = 100\%). In the case of mites, the pooled prevalence in this region was 33\% (95\% CI: 11-55, I(2) = 100\%, p {\textless} 0.00001), where the country-specific prevalence estimates were 30\% in Iran (95\% CI: 4-56, I(2) = 99\%) and 32\% in Egypt (95\% CI: 0-76, I(2) = 100\%). For ticks, the overall prevalence was found to be 25\% (95\% CI: 2-47, I(2) = 100\%, p {\textless} 0.00001), ranging from 16\% in Iran (95\% CI: 7-25, I(2) = 74\%) to 42\% in Egypt (95\% CI: 1-85, I(2) = 100\%). The control of rodent ectoparasites should be considered to reduce their adverse effects. Using the One Health strategy, rodent control, and precisely control of the most common rodent species, i.e., Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, and Rattus rattus, should be considered to control the rodent-borne ectoparasites in this region.},

	abstract = {Rodents can be a source of zoonotic helminths in the Middle East and also in other parts of the world. The current systematic review aimed to provide baseline data on rodent helminths to recognize the threats of helminth parasites on public health in the Middle East region. Following a systematic search on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, a total of 65 research studies on rodent cestodes, nematodes, and trematodes, which were conducted in the countries of the Middle East, were analyzed. The study identified 44 rodent species from which Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus, and Rattus rattus were most common (63\%) and recognized as the primary rodent hosts for helminth infestation in this region. Cestodes were the most frequently reported (n = 50), followed by nematodes (49), and trematodes (14). The random effect meta-analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of cestode (57.66\%, 95\%CI: 34.63-80.70, l(2)\% = 85.6, p {\textless} 0.001) was higher in Saudi Arabia, followed by nematode (56.24\%, 95\%CI: 11.40-101.1, l(2)\% = 96.7, p {\textless} 0.001) in Turkey, and trematode (15.83\%, 95\%CI: 6.25-25.1, l(2)\% = 98.5, p {\textless} 0.001) in Egypt. According to the overall prevalence estimates of individual studies, nematodes were higher (32.71\%, 95\%CI: 24.89-40.54, l(2)\% = 98.6, p {\textless} 0.001) followed by cestodes (24.88\%, 95\%CI: 19.99-29.77, l(2)\% = 94.9, p {\textless} 0.001) and trematodes (10.17\%, 95\%CI: 6.7-13.65, l(2)\% = 98.3, p {\textless} 0.001) in the rodents of the Middle East countries. The review detected 22 species of helminths, which have zoonotic importance. The most frequent helminths were Capillaria hepatica, Hymenolepis diminuta, Hymenolepis nana, and Cysticercus fasciolaris. There was no report of rodent-helminths from Bahrain, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Furthermore, there is an information gap on rodent helminths at the humans-animal interface level in Middle East countries. Through the One Health approach and countrywide detailed studies on rodent-related helminths along with their impact on public health, the rodent control program should be conducted in this region.},

	abstract = {Rodents are one of the most diversified terrestrial mammals, and they perform several beneficial activities in nature. These animals are also important as carriers of many pathogens with public health importance. The current systematic review was conducted to formulate a true depiction of rodent-related zoonoses in Qatar. Following systematic searches on PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science and a screening process, a total of 94 published articles were selected and studied. The studied articles reported 23 rodent-related zoonotic pathogens that include nine bacterial, eleven parasitic, and three viral pathogens, from which the frequently reported pathogens were Mycobacterium tuberculosis (32 reports), Escherichia coli (23), and Salmonella spp. (16). The possible pathway of entry of the rodent-borne pathogens can be the land port, seaports, and airport of Qatar through carrier humans and animals, contaminated food, and agricultural products. The pathogens can be conserved internally by rodents, pets, and livestock; by agricultural production systems; and by food marketing chains. The overall estimated pooled prevalence of the pathogens among the human population was 4.27\% (95\%CI: 4.03-4.51\%; p {\textless} 0.001) with significant heterogeneity (I(2) = 99.50\%). The top three highest prevalent pathogens were M. tuberculosis (30.90\%; 22.75-39.04\%; p {\textless} 0.001; I(2) = 99.70\%) followed by Toxoplasma gondii (21.93\%; 6.23-37.61\%; p {\textless} 0.001; I(2) = 99.30\%) and hepatitis E virus (18.29\%; 11.72-24.86\%; p {\textless} 0.001; I(2) = 96.70\%). However, there is a knowledge gap about the listed pathogens regarding the occurrence, transmission pathways, and rodent role in transmission dynamics at the human-animal-environment interface in Qatar. Further studies are required to explore the role of rodents in spreading zoonotic pathogens through the One Health framework, consisting of zoologists, ecologists, microbiologists, entomologists, veterinarians, and public health experts in this country.},

Although the neuroprotection of EBN in animals has been reported, there has not been yet systemically summarized. Thus, this review systemically outlined the evidence of the neuroprotective activity of EBN in modulating the cognitive functions of either healthy or with induced-cognitive dysfunction animals as compared to placebos. The related records from 2010 to 2020 were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and ScienceDirect using pre-specified keywords. The relevant records to the effect of EBN on cognition were selected according to the eligibility criteria and these studies underwent appraisal for the risk of bias. EBN improved the cognitive functions of induced-cognitive dysfunction and enhanced the cognitive performance of healthy animals as well as attenuated the neuroinflammations and neuro-oxidative stress in the hippocampus of these animals. Malaysian EBN could improve the cognitive functions of experimental animals as a treatment in induced cognitive dysfunction, a nutritional cognitive-enhancing agent in offspring and a prophylactic conservative effect on cognition against exposure to subsequent noxious cerebral accidents in a dose-depended manner through attenuating neuroinflammation and neuro-oxidative stress.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several natural products have been reported to elicit beneficial effects against neurodegenerative disorders due to their vitamin E contents. However, the neuroprotective efficacy of palm oil or its tocotrienol-rich fraction (TRF) from the pre-clinical cell and animal studies have not been systematically reviewed. METHODS: The protocol for this systematic review was registered in "PROSPERO" (CRD42019150408). This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) descriptors of PubMed with Boolean operators were used to construct keywords, including ("Palm Oil"[Mesh]) AND "Nervous System"[Mesh], ("Palm Oil"[Mesh]) AND "Neurodegenerative Diseases"[Mesh], ("Palm Oil"[Mesh]) AND "Brain"[Mesh], and ("Palm Oil"[Mesh]) AND "Cognition"[Mesh], to retrieve the pertinent records from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and ScienceDirect from 1990 to 2019, while bibliographies, ProQuest and Google Scholar were searched to ensure a comprehensive identification of relevant articles. Two independent investigators were involved at every stage of the systematic review, while discrepancies were resolved through discussion with a third investigator. RESULTS: All of the 18 included studies in this review (10 animal and eight cell studies) showed that palm oil and TRF enhanced the cognitive performance of healthy animals. In diabetes-induced rats, TRF and α-tocotrienol enhanced cognitive function and exerted antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory activities, while in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease (AD) animal model, TRF enhanced the cognitive function and reduced the deposition of β-amyloid by altering the expression of several genes related to AD and neuroprotection. In cell studies, simultaneous treatment with α-tocotrienols and neurotoxins improved the redox status in neuronal cells better than ϒ- and δ-tocotrienols. Both pre-treatment and post-treatment with α-tocotrienol relative to oxidative insults were able to enhance the survival of neuronal cells via increased antioxidant responses. CONCLUSIONS: Palm oil and its TRF enhanced the cognitive functions of healthy animals, while TRF and α-tocotrienol enhanced the cognitive performance with attenuation of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and apoptosis in diabetes-induced or transgenic AD animal models. In cell studies, TRF and α-tocotrienol exerted prophylactic neuroprotective effects, while α-tocotrienol exerted therapeutic neuroprotective effects that were superior to those of ϒ- and δ-tocotrienol isomers.},

	abstract = {Digital dermatitis (DD) is an infectious bacterial disease affecting cattle feet. Footbaths are a common herd-level control method for DD; however, variations in product, concentration, and frequency of use complicate comparisons between protocols. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate all walk-through footbath protocols reported that determined efficacy for prevention and treatment of DD lesions in dairy cattle. An extensive literature search was conducted, including electronic databases and gray literature updated until March 2018. Studies identified included all liquid walk-through footbath protocols that were compared to other footbath protocols or no footbath. Only studies with treatment or prevention of DD lesions as an outcome were included. Literature search and subsequent screening identified 14 publications with 24 treatment comparisons and 24 prevention comparisons. Studies included mostly had low and/or unclear risks of bias. Descriptive analyses were performed according to prevention and treatment outcomes, with case and success definitions summarized as odds ratios (OR). A subsequent network meta-analysis was conducted of 11 studies, comparing 17 protocol comparisons for the prevention outcome and 10 studies comparing 19 protocol comparisons for the treatment outcome, using semi-informative priors in a Bayesian statistical framework. Results of a random effects Bayesian network meta-analysis indicated only 5\% copper sulfate used at least 4 times/wk was superior to both no footbath (OR: 5.26; 95\% CrI: 1.27-28.8) and a water placebo (OR: 9.47; 95\% CrI: 1.03-85.8) in treatment of DD. No other protocol was associated with a reduction in DD, and there were no differences in pair-wise comparisons between any active treatments. Unfortunately, for both outcomes (treatment and prevention), small sample sizes (adjusted for clustering) limited the power to detect substantial differences between protocol effects. Thus, despite widespread use of footbaths, limited strength of evidence for use remains and standardized protocols with large sample sizes are needed to further investigate effectiveness of footbath protocols for control of DD. This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.},

A total of eight relative studies and 194 chicks were analyzed. The Random Effects model and the Fixed Effects model were performed. Using the Random Effects model for amino acids, a Standardized mean difference (SMD) of 2.05 and 1.46 was obtained for alanine and threonine concentrations respectively. This indicates a significant increase in the concentration of these amino acids within the plasma. An SMD of -2.68 and -2.46 was obtained for cysteine and proline concentrations respectively, this indicates a significant decrease in the concentration of these amino acids within the plasma. The pooled estimates regarding the effect of heat stress exposure on plasma amino acid concentrations for proline were -0.013. The SMDs obtained for amino acid concentrations within the brain (diencephalon) including leucine, methionine, valine and isoleucine were 1.799, 0.88, 2.11, 1.85, respectively, This indicates a significant increase in the concentration of these amino acids within the brain (P {\textless} 0.05). Comparing the SMD obtained for long-term heat exposure (two weeks) with the SMD obtained for short-term heat exposure shows that plasma amino acid concentrations including aspartic acid, glutamic acid, leucine, lysine, methionine, valine, isoleucine, tyrosine, glycine, proline, phenylalanine and threonine had all decreased. The relationship between heat exposure and changes in the concentration of some amino acids in the plasma is an important scientific finding.},

By combining the available literature on this topic, we sought to highlight effective methods for laboratory aggression testing and provide recommendations for study design as well as aggression induction and measurement in rodents that are translational to humans, taking into consideration possible confounding factors. In addition, we built a molecular landscape of interactions between the proteins encoded by the aggression-linked genes from our systematic search. Some molecular pathways within this landscape overlap with psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders and the landscapes point towards a number of putative (drug) targets for aggression that need to be validated in future studies.},

Variations in sex hormones during the reproductive cycle of females affect the homeostasis of the cardiovascular system. Also, the evidence shows that estrogens show a cardioprotective effect. On this basis, this study describes some vascular responses induced by vasoactive substances during the estrous cycle in rats. We obtained the information available on this topic from the online databases that included scientific articles published in the Web of Science, PubMed, and Scielo. Many investigations have evaluated the vasoactive response of substances such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine during the estrous cycle. In this review, we specifically described the vascular response to vasoactive substances in rats during the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and in ovariectomized rats. In addition, we discussed the existence of different signaling pathways that modulate vascular function. The knowledge of these effects is relevant for the optimization and development of new treatments for some vascular pathologies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To comprehensively review studies on dog-assisted interventions (DAIs) among older people in residential long-term care facilities (RLTCFs) and to provide an overview of their interventions, outcomes and methodological quality. METHOD: We searched 18 electronic databases to identify English articles (published January 2000-December 2019) reporting on well-defined DAIs targeting older adults (≥65 years) in RLTCF. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers. Descriptive statistics were produced for quantitative studies, with key themes identified among qualitative studies. Where possible, estimates were pooled from randomised controlled trials using random effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: Forty-three relevant studies (39 quantitative; 4 qualitative) were identified. The majority of quantitative studies were assessed as low-quality according to the MMAT criteria (n = 26, 67\%). Almost half of the quantitative studies (n = 18, 46\%) found no significant changes over time or between groups across outcomes measured. The most salient intervention effects included improved social functioning (n = 10), reduced depressive symptoms (n = 6) and loneliness (n = 5). A random-effects meta-analysis revealed a medium effect in favour of DAT on reducing depressive or loneliness symptoms (pooled SMD: 0.66, 95\%CI 0.21-1.11; I(2)  = 50.5; five trials), relative to treatment as usual. However, compared to treatment as usual, no overall effect of DAI on activities of daily living was detected (p = .737). Key themes from qualitative studies included (a) animals as effective transitional objects, (b) the therapeutic value of pets and (c) the significance of the care environment and stakeholders in facilitating DAI. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings of this review indicate that while DAI has value for older people in RLTCF, challenges remain in accurately measuring its impact to provide a stronger evidence-base. Standardisation of DAI service design, delivery and evaluation is required for future research and practice in providing holistic care for older adults.},

	abstract = {Clinical mastitis (CM) is one of the most frequent and costly diseases in dairy cows. A frustrating aspect of CM is its recurrent nature. This review was conducted to synthesize knowledge on risk of repeated cases of CM, effects of recurrent CM cases, and risk factors for CM recurrence. A systematic review methodology was used to identify articles for this narrative review. Searches were performed to identify relevant scientific literature published after 1989 in English or French from 2 databases (PubMed and CAB Abstracts) and 1 search platform (Web of Science). Fifty-seven manuscripts were selected for qualitative synthesis according to the inclusion criteria. Among the 57 manuscripts selected in this review, a description of CM recurrence, its risk factors, and effects were investigated and reported in 33, 37, and 19 selected manuscripts, respectively. Meta-analysis and meta-regression analyses were used to compute risk ratio comparing risk of CM in cows that already had 1 CM event in the current lactation with risk of CM in healthy cows. For these analyses, 9 manuscripts that reported the total number of lactations followed and the number of lactations with ≤1 and ≤2 CM cases were used. When summarizing results from studies requiring ≥5 d between CM events to consider a CM event as a new case, we observed no significant change in CM susceptibility following a first CM case (risk ratio: 0.99; 95\% confidence interval: 0.86-1.14). However, for studies using a more liberal CM recurrence definition (i.e., only 24 h between CM events to consider new CM cases), we observed a 1.54 times greater CM risk (95\% confidence interval: 1.20-1.97) for cows that already had 1 CM event in the current lactation compared with healthy cows. The most important risk factors for CM recurrence were parity (i.e., higher risk in older cows), a higher milk production, pathogen species involved in the preceding case, and whether a bacteriological cure was observed following the preceding case. The most important effects of recurrent CM were the milk yield reduction following a recurrent CM case, which was reported to be similar to that of the first CM case, and the increased risk of culling and mortality, which were reported to surpass those of first CM cases.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The pathogenic role of mycoplasmas in the lower respiratory tract (LRT) of dogs is debated, because mycoplasmas can be isolated from both healthy and sick dogs. OBJECTIVES: To critically assess available data from controlled observational studies on the role of 4 mycoplasma species in LRT disease of dogs. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analyses. METHODS: Seven electronic databases were searched for relevant publications. Risk of bias was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Meta-analyses, stratified by mycoplasmal species, were performed using a random effects Bayesian model with noninformative priors to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between Mycoplasma cynos, Mycoplasma canis, Mycoplasma spumans, and Mycoplasma edwardii and LRT disease in dogs. RESULTS: Five studies were included from 1201 references identified. All studies dealt with M. cynos, whereas 3 dealt with the other mycoplasma species. A significant association was found between M. cynos and LRT disease (Bayesian OR, 3.60; CI, 1.31-10.29). Conversely, M. canis, M. spumans, and M. edwardii were not significantly associated with LRT signs (Bayesian OR, 1.06; CI, 0.10-14.63; Bayesian OR, 3.40; CI, 0.16-54.27; and Bayesian OR, 1.04; CI, 0.05-23.54, respectively). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: Results support a pathogenic role of M. cynos and a commensal role of M. canis and M. edwardii in LRT in dogs. Although the association was not significant based on the CI, the point estimate of the Bayesian OR was relatively high for M. spumans, making its role less clear. Mycoplasma cynos-specific polymerase chain reaction should be considered on samples from dogs with LRT.},

However, the secretions of bee venom can also cause life-threatening adverse reactions. The objective of this paper was to review the clinical effectiveness of bee venom and adverse events induced by bee venom, regardless of the disease. Four electronic databases were searched in April 2020. The reference lists of the retrieved articles and previous review articles were also hand-searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using any type of bee venom other than live bee stings for the clinical treatment of any disease other than cancer were included. The studies were selected, the data were extracted, and the quality of the studies was assessed by two authors. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias standards. Twelve RCTs were included in this review-three on Parkinson's disease, four on arthralgia, four on musculoskeletal disorders, and one on polycystic ovary syndrome. The types of bee venom used were acupuncture injections, ultrasound gel, and an ointment. Six studies reported adverse events, and skin reactions such as pruritus and swelling were the most common. The large-scale clinical trials of bee venom therapy are needed to verify the statistical difference, and the reporting system for adverse events is also required to increase the safety of bee venom therapy.},

	abstract = {Protein degradation during ensiling is a major problem. Tannins are known to prevent or decelerate protein degradation in the rumen and may be able to do so in silages as well. Therefore, the present evaluation aimed to analyse the influence of tannins on silage quality. This was done by integrating from all suitable experiments found in literature on the topic in a meta-analysis approach. A total of 122 datasets originating from 28 experiments obtained from 16 published articles and one own unpublished experiment were included in the database. Tannins in the silages originated either from the plants ensiled or from supplementations of tanniferous plants or tannins extracted from such plants. Tannin concentrations ranged from 0 to 57.8 g/kg dry matter, and the ensiling period varied from 30 to 130 days. The analysis was based on the linear mixed model methodology in which the different studies were considered as random effects and tannin-related properties (either concentration or type of tannins) were treated as fixed effects. Results revealed that greater concentrations of tannins were associated with a decrease of butyrate concentration in the silages (p {\textless} 0.05). An increasing tannin concentration was also accompanied with smaller proportions of soluble N, free amino acid N, non-protein nitrogen and NH(3) -N in total silage N (p {\textless} 0.05). The relationships between hydrolysable and condensed tannins and the decline in butyrate and NH(3) -N concentrations in the silages were of different magnitude (p {\textless} 0.05). A higher tannin concentration was associated with a decline in in vitro dry matter digestibility. It was concluded that tannins apparently have the ability to limit extensive proteolysis which may occur during ensiling and thus may improve the fermentative quality of silages. A desired side effect seems to be given by the tannins' apparent property to limit the activity of the butyrate-producing microbes.},

The mean Odds Ratio (OR) for all studies was 0.565 (95\% confidence interval (CI) of 0.293 to 1.087), which means the percentage of protection in terms of decreased fluke burden in animals vaccinated with DNA vaccines was 43.5\%.

Moderate-quality evidence suggested that each 100-g/d increment in fish consumption was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (SRR: 0.92; 95\% CI: 0.87, 0.97), cardiovascular mortality (SRR: 0.75; 95\% CI: 0.65, 0.87), coronary heart disease (SRR: 0.88; 95\% CI: 0.79, 0.99), myocardial infarction (SRR: 0.75; 95\% CI: 0.65, 0.93), stroke (SRR: 0.86; 95\% CI: 0.75, 0.99), heart failure (SRR: 0.80; 95\% CI: 0.67, 0.95), depression (SRR: 0.88; 95\% CI: 0.79, 0.98), and liver cancer (SRR: 0.65; 95\% CI: 0.48, 0.87). For cancers of most sites, there was no significant association and the quality of the evidence was rated low and very low. In conclusion, evidence of moderate quality suggests that fish consumption is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, depression, and mortality and, therefore, can be considered as a healthy animal-based dietary source of protein. Further research is needed for outcomes for which the quality of the evidence was rated low and very low, considering types of fish consumed, different methods of cooking fish, and all potential confounding variables.},

We aimed to test the linear and potential non-linear dose-response relationships between fish consumption and risk of all-cause and cardiovascular (CVD) mortality, and possible confounding by region. DESIGN: Systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis. SETTING: Systematic search using PubMed and Scopus, from inception up to September 2016. SUBJECTS: Prospective observational studies reporting the estimates of all-cause and CVD mortality in relation to three or more categories of fish intake were included. Random-effects dose-response meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Fourteen prospective cohort studies (ten publications) with 911 348 participants and 75 451 incident deaths were included. A 20 g/d increment in fish consumption was significantly and inversely associated with the risk of CVD mortality (relative risk=0·96; 95 \% CI 0·94, 0·98; I 2=0 \%, n 8) and marginally and inversely associated with the risk of all-cause mortality (relative risk=0·98; 95 \% CI 0·97, 1·00; I 2=81·9 \%, n 14). Subgroup analysis resulted in a significant association only in the subgroup of Asian studies, compared with Western studies, in both analyses. Analysis of Western studies suggested a nearly U-shaped association, with a nadir at fish consumption of {\textasciitilde}20 g/d in analysis of both outcomes. Meanwhile, the associations appeared to be linear in Asian studies. CONCLUSIONS: There was potential evidence of regional differences in the association between fish consumption and mortality. It may be helpful to examine the associations by considering types of fish consumed and methods of fish preparation.},

We aimed to quantify the association of fish consumption with risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and to clarify the shape of the dose-response relation in Western and Asian countries. A systematic literature review was performed in PubMed and Scopus from inception to January 2018. Prospective observational studies reporting risk estimates of MI for 3 or more quantitative categories of fish intake were included. A random-effects dose-response meta-analysis was conducted. Eleven prospective cohort studies, comprising a total of 398,221 participants and 8468 cases of MI, were analyzed. A significant inverse association was found for the highest compared with the lowest category of fish intake (relative risk: 0.73, 95\% confidence interval: 0.59-0.87; I(2) = 72\%) and for a 15-g/d (105 g/wk, approximately equal to a 1 serving/wk) increment in fish consumption (relative risk: 0.96, 95\% confidence interval: 0.94-0.99; I(2) = 65\%). A subgroup analysis showed a significant inverse association only in the subgroup of Asian studies as compared to Western studies. A nonlinear dose-response analysis suggested a linear decrement in the risk with the increase in fish consumption in the analysis of Asian studies. A modest U-shaped association was observed in the analysis of Western studies. In conclusion, higher fish consumption was associated with a lower risk of MI. However, considering the observed regional difference in this association, further observational studies are needed to provide more detailed explanations about this difference.},

To estimate the risks of virus contamination, knowledge about the quantity of virus and decimal reduction values of the standard preservation method by salting is of great importance. A literature search, based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, was performed in search engine CAB Abstracts to determine the viral load of 14 relevant animal viruses in natural casings or intestines. Only a very limited number of scientific publications per virus were found and viral loads in the intestines varied from high for ASFV (five publications), BVDV (3), CSFV (6), PPRV (3), RPV(2) and TGEV (3) to moderate for PEDV (2) and SVDV (3), low for HEV (2) and FMDV (5), very low for VESV (1) and negative for PrV (2) and VSV (1). PRRSV was found in intestines, however, viral titers were not published. Three viruses (BVDV, CSFV and PPRV) with high viral loads were selected to search for their inactivation kinetics. For casings, no inactivation data were found, however, thermal inactivation data of these viruses were available, but differed in quantity, quality and matrices. In conclusion, important data gaps still exist when it comes to the quantitative inactivation of viruses in sausage casings or livestock intestines.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal diseases are prevalent in dogs, and probiotics could provide safe alternatives to conventional treatments. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical effects of probiotics when used in the prevention or treatment of gastrointestinal disease in dogs compared with no treatment, only symptomatic treatment, or conventional treatment. METHODS: A systematic review was preformed searching AGRICOLA, AGRIS, CAB Abstracts, Embase, Ovid MEDLINE, and Web of Science to identify articles published before April 1, 2017. Selection criteria were original research report, those published in peer reviewed journal, and study investigating in vivo use of probiotic for prevention or treatment of gastrointestinal disease in dogs. Studies were rated based on the level of evidence, and methodological quality was evaluated by the following variables: similarities between groups at baseline, risk of bias, and study group size. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five studies were identified, of which 17 met the inclusion criteria-12 concerned acute gastrointestinal disease and 5 concerned chronic gastrointestinal disease. The level of evidence ranged between randomized controlled studies and crossover uncontrolled trials; estimated risk of bias was generally moderate to high; and sample sizes were small. Feces consistency was the most frequently evaluated clinical variable. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The current data point toward a very limited and possibly clinically unimportant effect for prevention or treatment of acute gastrointestinal disease. For chronic gastrointestinal disease, dietary intervention remains the major key in treatment, whereas probiotic supplement seems not to add significant improvement. However, studies were often underpowered, underscoring the need for future larger, preferably multicenter studies.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent years, animal models of bone infections have been used with increased frequency in order to evaluate novel diagnostic and anti-infective technologies, like antibacterial coating of bone implants or local antibiotic carrier products. Therefore, it is highly relevant to evaluate the scientific quality of existing bone infection models. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of 316 studies of large non-rodent animal models of bone infection (254 rabbit, 16 pig, 23 dog, 11 goat, and 12 sheep) and extracted data on study design, methodological quality, and postmortem evaluation of infection with respect to reporting and quantification of pathology and microbiology. RESULTS: The review demonstrated a substantial lack of study-design information, which hampers reproducibility and continuation of the established work. Furthermore, the methodological study quality was found to be low, as the definition of infection, randomization, power analysis, and blinding were only seldomly reported. The use of histology increased in recent years, but a semi-quantitative scoring of the lesions was often missing, i.e. no objective quantification of outcome. Most of the studies focused on whether the inoculated bacteria were present within the bone tissue post mortem or not. However, very often the bacterial burden was not quantified. In many of the models, different antimicrobial interventions were examined and, although antimicrobial effects were commonly described, a lack of complete sterile outcome was observed in many models. On the basis of the systematic review, we established a study template providing a guideline for the standard reporting of animal models of bone infections, including details related to the animal, pathogen, infected animal, and postmortem analysis that are of crucial importance for validation of results and reproducibility. CONCLUSIONS: As the aim of many bone infection models is to examine the effect of an intervention, the guideline emphasizes the importance of objective quantification of outcome, e.g., blinded quantitative scoring of histological findings and quantification of bacterial burden within tissue and on inserted implants. Less than 5\% of the analyzed studies adhered completely to the ideal form presented in the study template. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Anti-infective interventions must be tested in preclinical animal models before implementation in human patients, and optimal design and validation is essential for a high translational value.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To combine the results of dysregulated lncRNAs in individual renal fibrosis lncRNA expression profiling studies and to identify potential lncRNA biomarkers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We systematically searched three databases to identify lncRNA expression studies of renal fibrosis in animal models and humans. The lncRNA expression data were extracted from 24 included studies, and a lncRNA vote-counting strategy was applied to identify significant lncRNA biomarkers. The lncLocator algorithm was utilized to predict the potential subcellular localization of these lncRNAs. The predicted targets of the identified lncRNA biomarkers were obtained by searching LncBase v.2 and catRAPID. Finally, GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses were performed. KEY FINDINGS: We recognized a significant lncRNA signature of 95 differentially expressed lncRNAs in 731 samples from rodent models of renal fibrosis and CKD patients, among which TCONS\_01181049 and TCONS\_01496394 were commonly upregulated in both urine and renal tissues, while lncRNA-Cancer Susceptibility Candidate 2 was downregulated in both blood and renal tissues. About 73.33\% dysregulated lncRNAs in renal fibrosis animal models and 81.82\% dysregulated lncRNAs in CKD patients were predicted to be localized to the cytoplasm. The most relevant biological processes and molecular functions associated with these lncRNAs were mRNA processing and RNA binding. SIGNIFICANCE: The present systematic review identified 95 significantly dysregulated lncRNAs from 24 studies and future investigations should focus on exploring their potential effects on renal fibrosis and their clinical utility as biomarkers or therapeutic targets.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To systematically review the literature regarding the biomechanical properties of various meniscal root repair techniques. METHODS: A systematic review of multiple databases was performed. The inclusion criteria included English language, studies relevant to meniscal root repairs, studies comparing 2 or more different discrete techniques, posterior root repairs, controlled laboratory studies, and human cadaveric or animal studies. Abstracts, case reports, cohort studies, case-control studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and studies of meniscal body repairs were excluded. RESULTS: Seventeen controlled laboratory studies were included for final analysis. There is no consensus on biomechanical superiority between transtibial pullout repair (TPR) and suture anchor repair. For TPR, there is no significant difference between 1 and 2 tibial tunnels. Nonanatomic repairs result in significantly lower joint surface contact areas and higher contact pressures, but suture placement farther from the root results in higher maximum load to failure. Two-suture repair has a greater maximum load to failure than 1-suture repair. Use of more than 2 sutures has diminishing returns. The modified Mason-Allen suture configuration is superior to a simple suture configuration, but there is no consensus regarding the superiority or feasibility of more complex sutures. There is no consensus on the superiority of a single suture material or shape. CONCLUSIONS: Anatomic meniscal root repairs with either TPR or suture anchor repair have better joint surface contact pressures and contact surface areas than nonanatomic repairs. The use of 2 sutures results in better fixation than 1 suture. There is evidence that the modified Mason-Allen suture configuration is superior to a simple suture configuration in a TPR, although the benefits of more complicated configurations are unclear. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study suggests that, in general, more complex sutures exhibit higher maximum loads. Increasing the number of sutures to up to 2 of the same configuration also increases the maximum load.},

METHODS: Human studies and large animal studies that optimized livers for transplantation using MP versus CS were assessed (PubMed/Medline/EMBASE). Meta-analyses were conducted for comparisons. Study quality was assessed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale and SYRCLE's risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included. Among the large animal studies, lower levels of lactate dehydrogenase (SMD -3.16, 95\% CI -5.14 to -1.18), alanine transferase (SMD -2.46, 95\% CI -4.03 to -0.90), and hyaluronic acid (SMD -2.48, 95\% CI -4.21 to -0.74) were observed in SNMP-preserved compared to CS-preserved livers. NMP-preserved livers showing lower level of hyaluronic acid (SMD -3.97, 95\% CI -5.46 to -2.47) compared to CS-preserved livers. Biliary complications (RR 0.45, 95\% CI 0.28 to 0.73) and early graft dysfunction (RR 0.56, 95\% CI 0.34 to 0.92) also significantly reduced with HMP preservation in human studies. No evidence of publication bias was found. CONCLUSIONS: MP preservation could improve short-term outcomes after transplantation compared to CS preservation. Additional randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to develop clinical applications of MP preservation.},

Pubmed, EMbase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Wanfang Data and China National Knowledge Infrastructure were researched for animal models of PJI after TKA from database establishment to April 2019 according to Chinese and English retrieval words, including "periprosthetic joint infections and total knee arthroplasty," "periprosthetic joint infections and model," "periprosthetic joint infections and biofilm," and "total knee arthroplasty and model." RESULTS: A total of 12 quantitative studies were enrolled in our study finally: 8 representative studies described prosthesis designs used in PJI animal models, 4 studies described prosthesis designs in non-infected animal models which were suitable for infection models. The major problems need to be dealed with were prosthesis, installation location, material, the function of separating the articular and medullary cavity, fixation manner, and the procedure of preserving the posterior cruciate ligament. CONCLUSION: A highly representative design of the animal prosthesis of PJI should meet the following criteria: the surface of the prosthesis is smooth with the formation of biofilm, composed of titanium-6Al-4V or cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloy; prosthesis can bear weight and is highly stable; and it can connect the joint cavity and medullary cavity simultaneously. To reach a more reliable conclusion, further experiments and improvements are required.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is a thermogenic tissue with potential as a therapeutic target in the treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders. The most used technique for quantifying human BAT activity is the measurement of (18) F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake via a positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan following exposure to cold. However, several studies have indicated the measurement of the supraclavicular skin temperature (SST) by infrared thermography (IRT) to be a less invasive alternative. This work reviews the state of the art of this latter method as a means of determining BAT activity in humans. METHODS: The data sources for this review were PubMed, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost (SPORTdiscus), and eligible studies were those conducted in humans. RESULTS: In most studies in which participants were first cooled, an increase in IRT-measured SST was noted. However, only 5 of 24 such studies also involved a nuclear technique that confirmed increased activity in BAT, and only 2 took into account the thickness of the fat layer when measuring SST by IRT. CONCLUSIONS: More work is needed to understand the involvement of tissues other than BAT in determining IRT-measured SST; at present, IRT cannot determine whether any increase in SST is due to increased BAT activity.},

Animal models serve as critical tools to advance the understanding of the mechanisms of wheat allergenicity to develop preventive and control methods. A comprehensive review on the molecular mechanisms of wheat allergenicity using animal models is unavailable at present. There were two major objectives of this study: To identify the lessons that animal models have taught us regarding the molecular mechanisms of wheat allergenicity and to identify the strengths, challenges, and future prospects of animal models in basic and applied wheat allergy research. Using the PubMed and Google Scholar databases, we retrieved and critically analyzed the relevant articles and excluded celiac disease and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. Our analysis shows that animal models can provide insight into the IgE epitope structure of wheat allergens, effects of detergents and other chemicals on wheat allergenicity, and the role of genetics, microbiome, and food processing in wheat allergy. Although animal models have inherent limitations, they are critical to advance knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of wheat allergenicity. They can also serve as highly useful pre-clinical testing tools to develop safer genetically modified wheat, hypoallergenic wheat products, novel pharmaceuticals, and vaccines.},

METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP, and Chinese Sinomed databases were searched systematically from their initiation date to October 5, 2018. Two researchers independently screened the literatures, which used the bone mineral density (BMD), total bone volume by total tissue volume (BV/TV) (\%), and trabecular thickness/spacing (Tb/Sp) as the outcome measures. RESULTS: Five eligible studies were selected. In the BMSC treatment groups, the BMD values and normalized BV/TV values remarkably increased. In addition, in the BMSCs plus other treatment groups, the BMD and Tb/Sp values significantly increased. CONCLUSION: This study showed that BMSCs could accelerate callus maturity, ossification and restore mechanical properties of bones in osteoporotic fractures.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: This article systematically reviews the current evidence regarding inflammation in Tendinopathy with the aim to increase understanding of a potential common pathophysiology. METHODS: Following the PRISMA statements, the terms: (tendinopathy OR (tendons AND rupture)) AND (inflammation OR (inflammation AND cells) OR immune system OR inflammation mediators OR bacteria) were used. One thousand four hundred thirty-one articles were identified which was screened down to 53. RESULTS: 39/53 studies mentioned inflammatory cells but had contradicting conclusions. Macrophages were the most common cell type and inflammatory markers were detectable in all the articles which measure them. CONCLUSIONS: The included studies show different conclusions, but this heterogeneity is not unexpected since the clinical criteria of 'tendinopathy' encompass a huge clinical spectrum. Different 'tendinopathy' conditions may have different pathophysiology, and even the same clinical condition may be at different disease stages during sampling, which can alter the histological and biochemical picture. Control specimen sampling was suboptimal since the healthy areas of the pathological-tendon may actually be sub-clinically diseased, as could the contralateral tendon in the same subject. Detection of inflammatory cells is most sensitive using immunohistochemistry targeting the cluster of differentiation markers, especially when compared to the conventional haematoxylin and eosin staining methods. The identified inflammatory cell types favour a chronic inflammatory process; which suggests a persistent stimulus. This means NSAID and glucocorticoids may be useful since they suppress inflammation, but it is noted that they may hinder tendon healing and cause long term problems. This systematic review demonstrates a diversity of data and conclusions in regard to inflammation as part of the pathogenesis of Tendinopathy, ranging from ongoing or chronic inflammation to non-inflammatory degeneration and chronic infection. Whilst various inflammatory markers are present in two thirds of the reviewed articles, the heterogenicity of data and lack of comparable studies means we cannot conclude a common pathophysiology from this systematic review.},

These animals were chosen due to their origin of existence (Neo-tropics) and over time these animals became domesticated and were distributed throughout the world. Over eighty (80) references were collected for this review and the papers spanned over eighty (80) years from 1934 to 2018. The gastrointestinal parasites reported for each animal were tabulated and their effects in the animal noted. Parasites reported in domesticated Neo-tropical animals had little to no effect on wild and free ranging animals with a few cases of illness and decreased productivity. The majority of articles viewed these animals as reservoir host which can infect humans and other domesticated livestock. It must also be noted that research done in the past did not focus on the effect these parasites had on these animals but only observed their potential as reservoirs for parasitic diseases.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: As interest in Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAI) grows, there is increasing need to differentiate informal activities from formal and professionally directed therapies, including mental health focussed Canine-Assisted Psychotherapy (CAP). There have been no reviews focusing exclusively on CAP and the distinct developmental period of adolescence. The aims of this study were to identify the characteristics of CAP interventions, their impacts and their acceptability, tolerability and feasibility for adolescents with mental health disorders. METHOD: A systematic review identified studies incorporating canines into mental health treatments for adolescents aged 10-19 years. Studies reporting qualitative or quantitative psychological or psychosocial outcomes were included. RESULTS: Seven studies were scrutinised. Intervention characteristics varied, including a range of formats, settings, locations, doses, and facilitators. Information on the role of the canines in sessions was sparse. CAP had a positive impact on primary diagnoses and symptomatology, conferring additional benefits to standard treatments for internalising disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and equivalent effects for anxiety, anger and externalising disorders. CAP was associated with positive impacts on secondary factors including increased engagement and socialisation behaviours, and reductions in disruptive behaviours within treatment sessions. Global functioning also improved. There was insufficient evidence that CAP improved factors associated with self-esteem, subjective wellbeing, or coping. Good attendance and retention rates indicated high levels of acceptability. Moderate to high tolerability was also indicated. Feasibility may be limited by additional training and logistical requirements. RECOMMENDATIONS: We recommend the development of theoretically informed, standardised (manualised) intervention protocols that may subsequently form the basis of efficacy and effectiveness testing. Such protocols should clearly describe canine-participant-facilitator interactions via a formalised nomenclature; spontaneous (animal-led), adjunctive (facilitator-led), and experiential (participant-led). CONCLUSIONS: There is emerging evidence to suggest that CAP improves the efficacy of mental health treatments in self-selected adolescent populations via reductions in primary symptomatology, and via secondary factors that improve therapeutic processes and quality, such as engagement and retention.},

There is a risk, therefore, that the information needs of poultry producers regarding the costs associated with particular diseases are not being adequately met. A systematic literature review of poultry production diseases was undertaken, first, to scope the availability of studies that estimate the financial impacts of production diseases on poultry systems and, second, on the basis of these studies, estimates were generated of the magnitude of these impacts. Nine production diseases, selected by a panel of stakeholders as being economically important in the EU, were examined. The review found that the poultry disease literature has primarily an epidemiological focus, with very few publications providing estimates of the financial impacts of diseases. However, some publications have quantified the physical impacts of production diseases and control interventions, for example, using measures such as output volumes, mortality rates and bacterial counts. Using these data in standard financial models, partial financial analyses were possible for some poultry production diseases. Coccidiosis and clostridiosis were found to be the most common production diseases in broiler flocks, with salpingoperitonitis being the most common in layers. While the financial impact of untreated diseases varied, most uncontrolled diseases were estimated to make flocks loss-making. However, in all cases, interventions were available that significantly reduced these losses. The review reinforces the concern that the available academic literature is not providing sufficient information for poultry producers to decide on financially optimal disease-prevention and treatment measures.},

	abstract = {During the past decade, African swine fever (ASF) has spread from the Caucasus region to eastern European Union countries affecting domestic pig and wild boar populations. In order to avert ASF spread, mitigation measures targeting both populations have been established. However, despite these efforts, ASF has been reported in thirteen different countries (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia, the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Moldova, Czech Republic, and Romania). In the absence of an effective vaccine or treatment to ASF, introduction and spread of ASF onto domestic pig farms can only be prevented by strict compliance to control measures. This study systematically reviewed available measures to prevent the spread of ASF in the EU domestic pig sector distinguishing between commercial, non-commercial, and outdoor farms. The search was performed in PubMed and using a common browser. A total of 52 documents were selected for the final review process, which included scientific articles, reports, EU documents and official recommendations, among others. From this literature review, 37 measures were identified as preventive measures for the introduction and spread of ASF. Subsequently, these measures were assessed by ASF experts for their relevance in the mitigation of ASF spread on the three mentioned types of farms. All experts agreed that some of the important preventive measures for all three types of farms were: the identification of animals and farm records; strict enforcement of the ban on swill feeding; and containment of pigs, so as to not allow direct or indirect pig-pig and/or pig-wild boar contacts. Other important preventive measures for all farms were education of farmers, workers, and operators; no contact between farmers and farm staff and external pigs; appropriate removal of carcasses, slaughter residues, and food waste; proper disposal of manure and dead animals, and abstaining from hunting activities during the previous 48 h (allowing a 48 h interval between hunting and being in contact with domestic pigs). Finally, all experts identified that the important preventive measures for non-commercial and outdoor farms is to improve access of those farms to veterinarians and health services.},

	abstract = {Dietary iron and zinc deficiencies are a global health concern. Bacteria that colonize the gastrointestinal tract depend on minerals to maintain their activities; thus, recent evidence suggests that biofortified foods can modulate the host's beneficial bacterial taxa. The current review analyzed the research data that linked between iron and zinc biofortified foods and gut microbiota modulation. The data analysis was based on the PRISMA guidelines and the data search was performed at PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Scopus databases for experimental studies published from January 2010 until December 2020. The five selected studies were conducted in an experimental in vivo model (Gallus gallus). The identified and discussed research showed positive effects of biofortified foods on the composition and function of the gut microbiota. Further, an increase in short chain fatty acids producing bacterial populations as Lactobacillus and Ruminococcus, and a decrease in potentially pathogenic bacteria as Streptococcus, Escherichia, and Enterobacter was identified due to the consumption of biofortified foods. In conclusion, biofortified foods may contribute to improved gut health without increasing the colonization of pathogenic bacteria. The dietary inclusion of approximately 50\% of iron/zinc biofortified foods has a significant beneficial effect on the gut microbiota. Additional studies in humans and animal models are warranted to further establish the suggested effects on the intestinal microbiome. PROSPERO (CRD42020184221).},

	abstract = {Myocardial infarction (MI) is a worldwide condition that affects millions of people. This is mainly caused by the adult human heart lacking the ability to regenerate upon injury, whereas zebrafish have the capacity through cardiomyocyte proliferation to fully regenerate the heart following injury such as apex resection (AR). But a systematic overview of the methods used to evidence heart regrowth and regeneration in the zebrafish is lacking. Herein, we conducted a systematical search in Embase and Pubmed for studies on heart regeneration in the zebrafish following injury and identified 47 AR studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Overall, three different methods were used to assess heart regeneration in zebrafish AR hearts. 45 out of 47 studies performed qualitative (37) and quantitative (8) histology, whereas immunohistochemistry for various cell cycle markers combined with cardiomyocyte specific proteins was used in 34 out of 47 studies to determine cardiomyocyte proliferation qualitatively (6 studies) or quantitatively (28 studies). For both methods, analysis was based on selected heart sections and not the whole heart, which may bias interpretations. Likewise, interstudy comparison of reported cardiomyocyte proliferation indexes seems complicated by distinct study designs and reporting manners. Finally, six studies performed functional analysis to determine heart function, a hallmark of human heart injury after MI. In conclusion, our data implies that future studies should consider more quantitative methods eventually taking the 3D of the zebrafish heart into consideration when evidencing myocardial regrowth after AR. Furthermore, standardized guidelines for reporting cardiomyocyte proliferation and sham surgery details may be considered to enable inter study comparisons and robustly determine the effect of given genes on the process of heart regeneration.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimisation of trypanosomosis control programs warrants a good knowledge of the main vector of animal and human trypanosomes in sub-Saharan Africa, the tsetse fly. An important aspect of the tsetse fly population is its trypanosome infection prevalence, as it determines the intensity of the transmission of the parasite by the vector. We therefore conducted a systematic review of published studies documenting trypanosome infection prevalence from field surveys or from laboratory experiments under controlled conditions. Publications were screened in the Web of Science, PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Using the four-stage (identification, screening, eligibility and inclusion) process in the PRISMA statement the initial screened total of 605 studies were reduced to 72 studies. The microscopic examination of dissected flies (dissection method) remains the most used method to detect trypanosomes and thus constituted the main focus of this analysis. Meta-regression was performed to identify factors responsible for high trypanosome prevalence in the vectors and a random effects meta-analysis was used to report the sensitivity of molecular and serological tests using the dissection method as gold standard. RESULTS: The overall pooled prevalence was 10.3\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 8.1\%, 12.4\%) and 31.0\% (95\% CI = 20.0\%, 42.0\%) for the field survey and laboratory experiment data respectively. The country and the year of publication were found to be significantly factors associated with the prevalence of trypanosome infection in tsetse flies. The alternative diagnostic tools applied to dissection positive samples were characterised by low sensitivity, and no information on the specificity was available at all. CONCLUSION: Both temporal and spatial variation in trypanosome infection prevalence of field collected tsetse flies exists, but further investigation on real risk factors is needed how this variation can be explained. Improving the sensitivity and determining the specificity of these alternative diagnostic tools should be a priority and will allow to estimate the prevalence of trypanosome infection in tsetse flies in high-throughput.},

	abstract = {The objective of this project was to evaluate the effects of antimicrobials approved for parenteral metaphylactic use in feeder and stocker calves on morbidity and mortality for bovine respiratory disease with the use of a mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis. An initial literature review was conducted in April 2016 through Pubmed, Agricola, and CAB (Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau) for randomized controlled trials for metaphylaxis antimicrobial administered parentally to incoming feedlot or stocker calves within 48 h of arrival. The final list of publications included 29 studies, with a total of 37 trials. There were 8 different metaphylactic antimicrobials. Final event outcomes were categorized into bovine respiratory disease (BRD) morbidity cumulative incidence d 1 to {\textless}/= 60 of the feeding period, BRD morbidity cumulative incidence d 1 to closeout of the feeding period, BRD mortality cumulative incidence d 1 to closeout of the feeding period, and BRD retreatment cumulative incidence morbidity d 1 to closeout of the feeding period. Network meta-analysis combined direct and indirect evidence for all the event outcomes to determine mean odds ratio (OR) with 95\% credibility intervals (CrIs) for all metaphylactic antimicrobial comparisons. The "upper tier" treatment arms for morbidity d 1 to {\textless}/= 60 included tulathromycin, gamithromycin, and tilmicosin. For BRD mortality cumulative incidence d 1 to closeout and BRD retreatment morbidity d 1 to closeout, classifying the treatment arms into tiers was not possible due to overlapping 95\% CrIs. The results of this project accurately identified differences between metaphylactic antimicrobials, and metaphylactic antimicrobial options appear to offer different outcomes on BRD morbidity and mortality odds in feedlot cattle.},

DESIGN: Meta-analysis. SAMPLE POPULATION: Cattle, horses, goats, and sheep experimentally infected PO with Salmonella enterica subsp enterica. PROCEDURES: Online databases were searched for published reports describing results of experimental infection of cattle, horses, goats, and sheep PO with salmonellae. Time to detection of organisms in feces as well as to onset of diarrhea and pyrexia was noted. Analysis of covariance was used to examine relationships among these variables, host species and age, and Salmonella serovar and magnitude of infecting dose. RESULTS: Forty-three studies met the criteria for inclusion. Time to detection of salmonellae in feces ranged from 0.5 to 4 days. Times to onset of diarrhea and pyrexia ranged from 0.33 to 11 days and from 0.27 to 5 days, respectively. Time to onset of diarrhea was related to host age and Salmonella serovar. No other associations were identified. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Time to detection of salmonellae in feces is unreliable for identifying hospital-acquired infections; a 3-day criterion will misidentify hospital- versus community-acquired infections. Relying on clinical indices such as times to onset of diarrhea and pyrexia to trigger fecal sampling for detection of Salmonella infection will increase the risk of environmental contamination and nosocomial spread because animals may begin shedding organisms in feces several days prior.},

While articles about animal model infectivity have been published for G. duodenalis, the studies have used diverse protocols and parameters to evaluate the infectivity of this protozoan parasite. Hence, the objectives of this study were to (1) conduct a meta-analysis of published literature for cyst shedding and diarrhea outcomes in animal models and (2) develop recommendations to help standardize experimental dose response studies. Results showed that, for the outcome of cyst shedding in faeces, the covariates of infective stage (cyst versus trophozoite), Giardia dose, and the interactions between doses and infective stage, as well as dose and species of experimental host, were all significant (P value {\textless}/= 0.05). This study suggests inoculation of the experimental host with cysts rather than trophozoites and administration of higher doses of Giardia will most likely result in cyst shedding. Based on the results of this meta-analysis, the infective stage (cyst versus trophozoite), parasite dose, and the interactions between dose and infective stage, as well as dose and species of experimental host, should be considered when designing experimental dose response studies that will assist in the study of zoonotic neglected tropical diseases globally.},

The objectives of this study were to (1) conduct a meta-analysis of published literature for oocyst shedding and diarrhoea outcomes, and (2) develop recommendations for standardization of experimental dose-response studies. Results showed that for the outcome of oocyst shedding in faeces, the covariates 'experimental species', 'immunosuppression', 'oocyst dose' and 'oocyst dose' x 'age' were all significant (P 0.05). This study suggests that exposing mice, piglets, or ruminants, and using immunosuppressed experimental hosts, is more likely to result in oocyst shedding. For the outcome of diarrhoea in experimentally infected animal species, the key covariates 'experimental species', 'age' and 'immunosuppression' were significant (P 0.2). Therefore, based on the results of this meta-analysis, these variables should be carefully reported and considered when designing experimental dose-response studies. Additionally, detection of possible publication bias highlights the need to publish additional studies that convey statistically non-significant as well as significant results in the future.},

METHOD AND RESULTS: Relevant data were extracted from 159 research papers and findings were grouped into 14 sources of on-farm contamination and 37 contributing factors. A relevancy score was developed to take into account various measures from each study of applicability to GB broilers and strength of findings. Results indicate that major sources of Campylobacter include a depopulation event, another house on-farm, on-farm staff, and other animals on farm. The depopulation schedule (staggered slaughter) and multiple houses on-farm were identified as contributing factors associated with increasing the risk, and those decreasing the risk were use of a hygiene barrier, parent company and certain seasons of rearing. CONCLUSIONS: Although the review was more resource intensive compared to narrative studies, the system allows an increased level of transparency and the ability to investigate patterns and trends.

In Part One we reviewed the studies that compared these parameters between laying hens housed in aviaries and in conventional cages. In Part Two we investigated the relative impact of strain, beak trimming and rearing condition on productivity and mortality in aviaries. The comparative analysis revealed that aviary hens consumed 3.0\% more food than caged hens, and food conversion was 6.7\% higher in aviaries than in cages. On the other hand, the mortality rate and cannibalism rate did not differ significantly between the two housing systems. The analysis of causes of variation in productivity, mortality rate and cannibalism rate in aviaries revealed a strong effect of strain. Beak trimming was associated with a reduced prevalence of cannibalism rates but had no effect on overall mortality. It also reduced egg weight and food consumption. Early access to litter during the rearing period had a positive effect on egg weight; egg mass, food conversion and mortality rate. In conclusion, we found a slightly reduced productivity of aviaries in relation to cages although the mortality rates and the prevalence of cannibalism did not differ between these housing systems. To further improve productivity and reduce mortality of hens housed in aviaries we recommend the choice of suitable strains and the implementation of improved rearing conditions including early access to litter.},

	abstract = {Avian influenza or bird flu is a highly contagious acute viral disease that can occur in epidemics and cross-border forms in poultry and wild birds. The characteristics of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) allow the emergence of new viral variants, some with zoonotic and pandemic potential. AIVs have been identified in Latin America; however, there is a lack of understanding of these viruses at the regional level. We performed a systematic literature review on serological or molecular evidence of AIVs circulation in Latin America. Methods were designed based on the PRISMA and STROME guidelines. Only peer-reviewed studies published between 2000 to 2015 and data was analysed based on country, viral subtype, avian species, and phylogenetic origins. From 271 studies initially found only twenty-six met our inclusion criteria. Evidence of AIVs infection was found in most Latin American countries, with Mexico as the country with the largest number of conducted studies and reported cases during the period analysed, followed by Chile and Argentina. Most of the AIVs were early reported through surveillance systems and at least 14 different subtypes of influenza viruses were reported in birds, and the presence of both low (92.9\%) and high (7.1\%) pathogenic AIVs was shown in Latin America. Of the reported AIVs in Latin America, 43.7\% belong to migratory birds, 28.1\% to local wild birds, and 28.1\% to poultry. The migratory bird population mainly comprises families belonging to the orders Anseriformes and Charadriformes. We highlight the importance of epidemiological surveillance systems and the possible role of different migratory birds in the transmission of AIVs within the Americas. Our findings demonstrate the limited information on AIVs in Latin America and highlight the need of more studies on AIVs at the regional level, particularly those focused on identifying the endemic subtypes in regional wild birds.},

The objective was to compare the effect of trough or pasture FE on ADG, diet OM digestibility (OMD), various carcass characteristics, and the interaction between FE and complementation modalities. Liveweight was adjusted in order to compare results between species. Results showed that trough-fed animals had higher ADG (+17.89\%, P{\textless}0.001), hot carcass yield (HYield, + 2.47\%, P{\textless}0.001) and carcass fat content (+ 24.87\%, P{\textless}0.001) than pasture-fed animals but lower carcass muscle and bone percentages (-1.60\%, P=0.010 and -7.63\%, P=0.003, respectively). Feeding environment had no effect on diet OMD (P=0.818), but the number of observations was low. After integrating added concentrate (addiCO), FE effect persisted on ADG (P=0.024) and carcass fat content (P=0.027) but not on HYield (P=0.078) or muscle and bone percentages (P=0.119 and P=0.581, respectively). After integrating nature of the concentrate (natCO), FE effect persisted on ADG (P{\textless}0.001) and HYield (P=0.004). Integrating percentage of concentrate (PCO) erased FE effect on ADG (P=0.891) and HYield (P=0.128). In contrast, integrating quantity of concentrate (QCO) erased FE effect on ADG (P=0.084) but not on HYield (P=0.006) or on carcass fat and muscle contents (P=0.040 and P=0.040, respectively), although the FE effect on carcass bone content persisted (P=0.550). Animal species and physiological stage had no effect on any of the variables studied (P{\textgreater}0.05), but experiment did (P{\textless}/=0.001). The increase in ADG was positively correlated to HYield in cattle (P=0.002) and small ruminants (P=0.003) and positively linked to carcass fat content (P=0.007) but not carcass muscle content, which actually decreased (P=0.001). Overall, this meta-analysis confirmed previous reports of FE effects and revealed how the differences generally reported result from a confounding effect of FE and nature of the diet. Indeed, in most of the studies used, trough-fed animals were supplemented with concentrate whereas pasture-fed animals were not. This research also highlighted the fact that pasture-fed animals have the potential to achieve the same performances as trough-fed animals when fed a similar diet.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review was to assess the effects of repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids on lung and brain function and on growth restriction in animals. STUDY DESIGN: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for randomized controlled trials that compared repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids versus a single dose, with or without placebo, in pregnant animals. RESULTS: Nineteen studies were included. The animals that were studied included sheep, monkeys, rabbits, and mice. There were 8 studies that assessed the effects of repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids on lung function. All the studies reported improvement in lung function after repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids. Seven studies investigated the effects of repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids on brain or nervous system function or growth; all the studies found adverse effects with repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids. Eleven studies looked at the effect of repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids on fetal growth. Nine studies found evidence of fetal growth restriction with repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids. One study assessed long-term behavioral outcomes in mice and found no effect. CONCLUSION: Evidence from randomized controlled trials in animals suggests that repeated doses of antenatal corticosteroids may have beneficial effects in terms of lung function but may have adverse effects on brain function and fetal growth. Because of the differences between animals and humans, it is difficult to extrapolate directly the results of these studies to humans. Therefore, randomized controlled trials in humans are needed to assess the effects of repeated courses of antenatal corticosteroids for pregnant women who are at increased risk of preterm birth in terms of important perinatal, neonatal, and maternal outcomes.},

	abstract = {Campylobacter and antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter are frequently isolated from broiler chickens worldwide. In Canada, campylobacteriosis is the third leading cause of enteric disease and the regional emergence of ciprofloxacin-resistant Campylobacter in broiler chickens has raised a public health concern. This study aimed to identify, critically appraise, and synthesize literature on sources of Campylobacter in broilers at the farm level using systematic review methodology. Literature searches were conducted in January 2012 and included electronic searches in four bibliographic databases. Relevant studies in French or English (n = 95) conducted worldwide in any year and all study designs were included. Risk of Bias and GRADE criteria endorsed by the Cochrane collaboration was used to assess the internal validity of the study and overall confidence in the meta-analysis. The categories for on-farm sources were: broiler breeders/vertical transfer (number of studies = 32), animals (n = 57), humans (n = 26), environment (n = 54), and water (n = 63). Only three studies examined the antimicrobial resistance profiles of Campylobacter from these on-farm sources. Subgroups of data by source and outcome were analyzed using random effect meta-analysis. The highest risk for contaminating a new flock appears to be a contaminated barn environment due to insufficient cleaning and disinfection, insufficient downtime, and the presence of an adjacent broiler flock. Effective biosecurity enhancements from physical barriers to restricting human movement on the farm are recommended for consideration to enhance local on-farm food safety programs. Improved sampling procedures and standardized laboratory testing are needed for comparability across studies. Knowledge gaps that should be addressed include farm-level drug use and antimicrobial resistance information, further evaluation of the potential for vertical transfer, and improved genotyping methods to strengthen our understanding of Campylobacter epidemiology in broilers at the farm-level. This systematic review emphasizes the importance of improved industry-level and on-farm risk management strategies to reduce pre-harvest Campylobacter in broilers.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine whether animal studies can reliably be used to determine the usefulness of methylprednisolone (MP) and other treatments for acute spinal cord injury (SCI) in humans. This was achieved by performing a systematic review of animal studies on the effects of MP administration on the functional outcome of acute SCI. Data were extracted from the published articles relating to: outcome; MP dosing regimen; species/strain; number of animals; methodological quality; type of injury induction; use of anaesthesia; functional scale used; and duration of follow-up. Subgroup analyses were performed, based on species or strain, injury method, MP dosing regimen, functional outcome measured, and methodological quality. Sixty-two studies were included, which involved a wide variety of animal species and strains. Overall, beneficial effects of MP administration were obtained in 34\% of the studies, no effects in 58\%, and mixed results in 8\%. The results were inconsistent both among and within species, even when attempts were made to detect any patterns in the results through subgroup analyses. The results of this study demonstrate the barriers to the accurate prediction from animal studies of the effectiveness of MP in the treatment of acute SCI in humans. This underscores the need for the development and implementation of validated testing methods.},

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of parity on the rates of dystocia and stillbirth. A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the impact of first parity (primiparous) and later parities (multiparous) on dystocia and stillbirth in Holstein cattle. A total of 30 and 19 papers were analyzed for evaluation of two traits. Results revealed that primiparous cattle are more susceptible to dystocia [Odds Ratio (OR)=2.68, 95\% Confidence interval (CI) 2.51 to 2.85], stillbirth (OR=2.18, 95\% CI 1.84 to 2.58) as compared with multiparous. These results supported the opinion about the importance of considering primiparous and multiparous as different traits in genetic evaluation and shed light on the importance of improving genetics and environment of heifers to minimize the effect of dystocia and stillbirth in Holstein cattle.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Leptospirosis is an important but neglected bacterial zoonosis that has been largely overlooked in Africa. In this systematic review, we aimed to summarise and compare current knowledge of: (1) the geographic distribution, prevalence, incidence and diversity of acute human leptospirosis in Africa; and (2) the geographic distribution, host range, prevalence and diversity of Leptospira spp. infection in animal hosts in Africa. METHODS: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched for studies that described (1) acute human leptospirosis and (2) pathogenic Leptospira spp. infection in animals. We performed a literature search using eight international and regional databases for English and non-English articles published between January 1930 to October 2014 that met out pre-defined inclusion criteria and strict case definitions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: We identified 97 studies that described acute human leptospirosis (n = 46) or animal Leptospira infection (n = 51) in 26 African countries. The prevalence of acute human leptospirosis ranged from 2 3\% to 19 8\% (n = 11) in hospital patients with febrile illness. Incidence estimates were largely restricted to the Indian Ocean islands (3 to 101 cases per 100,000 per year (n = 6)). Data from Tanzania indicate that human disease incidence is also high in mainland Africa (75 to 102 cases per 100,000 per year). Three major species (Leptospira borgpetersenii, L. interrogans and L. kirschneri) are predominant in reports from Africa and isolates from a diverse range of serogroups have been reported in human and animal infections. Cattle appear to be important hosts of a large number of Leptospira serogroups in Africa, but few data are available to allow comparison of Leptospira infection in linked human and animal populations. We advocate a 'One Health' approach to promote multidisciplinary research efforts to improve understanding of the animal to human transmission of leptospirosis on the African continent.},

	abstract = {There are numerous treatments for correction of dorsal displacement of the soft palate (DDSP). However, the efficacy of these treatments is controversial and there is little consensus on how best to treat this condition. The aims of this study were to systematically review the literature and to assess the evidence on the clinical effects of interventions for dynamic intermittent DDSP. A secondary objective was to assess whether factors relating to study quality affected reported success rates. Twenty-three studies were included, covering a wide number of interventions but also differing widely is terms of study design, sample size, method of diagnosis, outcome measure and the number lost to follow-up. The assessment of adverse effects was severely limited because of lack of reporting. The way in which success is measured appears to have a great effect on the reported results. Research synthesis has been severely limited because of the heterogeneity in the included studies. The low level of evidence makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions as to the efficacy of procedures for DDSP. Hence it is currently not possible to determine which procedure is the most appropriate. This systematic review highlights the difficulties of studying palatal dysfunction and suggests areas where improvements can be made in future studies.},

A total of 85 articles published between 1968 and 2010 were used, totaling 1012 treatments and 13 196 animals. The meta-analysis followed three sequential analyses: graphical, correlation and variance-covariance. The presence of mycotoxins in diets was seen to reduce the feed intake by 18\% and the weight gain in 21\% compared with the control group. Deoxynivalenol and aflatoxins were the mycotoxins with the greatest impact on the feed intake and growth of pigs, reducing by 26\% and 16\% in the feed intake and by 26\% and 22\% in the weight gain. The mycotoxin concentration in diets and the animal age at challenge were the variables that more improved the coefficient of determination in equations for estimating the effect of mycotoxins on weight gain. The mycotoxin effect on growth proved to be greater in younger animals. In addition, the residual analysis showed that the greater part of the variation in weight gain was explained by the variation in feed intake (87\%). The protein and methionine levels in diets could influence the feed intake and the weight gain in challenged animals. The weight gain in challenged pigs showed a positive correlation with the methionine level in diets (0.68). The mycotoxin effect on growth was greater in males compared with the effect on females. The reduction in weight gain was of 15\% in the female group and 19\% in the male group. Mycotoxin presence in pig diets has interfered in the relative weight of the liver, the kidneys and the heart. Mycotoxins have an influence on performance and organ weight in pigs. However, the magnitude of the effects varies with the type and concentration of mycotoxin, sex and the animal age, as well as nutritional factors.},

	abstract = {Monensin is a widely used feed additive with the potential to minimize methane (CH4) emissions from cattle. Several studies have investigated the effects of monensin on CH4, but findings have been inconsistent. The objective of the present study was to conduct meta-analyses to quantitatively summarize the effect of monensin on CH4 production (g/d) and the percentage of dietary gross energy lost as CH4 (Ym) in dairy cows and beef steers. Data from 22 controlled studies were used. Heterogeneity of the monensin effects were estimated using random effect models. Due to significant heterogeneity ({\textgreater}68\%) in both dairy and beef studies, the random effect models were then extended to mixed effect models by including fixed effects of DMI, dietary nutrient contents, monensin dose, and length of monensin treatment period. Monensin reduced Ym from 5.97 to 5.43\% and diets with greater neutral detergent fiber contents (g/kg of dry matter) tended to enhance the monensin effect on CH4 in beef steers. When adjusted for the neutral detergent fiber effect, monensin supplementation [average 32 mg/kg of dry matter intake (DMI)] reduced CH4 emissions from beef steers by 19 +/- 4 g/d. Dietary ether extract content and DMI had a positive and a negative effect on monensin in dairy cows, respectively. When adjusted for these 2 effects in the final mixed-effect model, monensin feeding (average 21 mg/kg of DMI) was associated with a 6 +/- 3 g/d reduction in CH4 emissions in dairy cows. When analyzed across dairy and beef cattle studies, DMI or monensin dose (mg/kg of DMI) tended to decrease or increase the effect of monensin in reducing methane emissions, respectively. Methane mitigation effects of monensin in dairy cows (-12 +/- 6 g/d) and beef steers (-14 +/- 6 g/d) became similar when adjusted for the monensin dose differences between dairy cow and beef steer studies. When adjusted for DMI differences, monensin reduced Ym in dairy cows (-0.23 +/- 0.14) and beef steers (-0.33 +/- 0.16). Monensin treatment period length did not significantly modify the monensin effects in dairy cow or beef steer studies. Overall, monensin had stronger antimethanogenic effects in beef steers than dairy cows, but the effects in dairy cows could potentially be improved by dietary composition modifications and increasing the monensin dose.},

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review. METHODS: An on-line bibliographic search through Medline, PubMed, Veterinary Information Network, and Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau Abstracts was performed during August 2004. Two hundred and forty resources of information were identified. Studies were compared and evaluated with regard to study design (retrospective, prospective, randomization), surgical technique, short- and long-term follow-up, and evidence classification. RESULTS: Twenty-eight resources qualified to assist with evidence classification. No class I or class II studies were present, 5 studies were categorized as a class III and 23 studies were categorized as a class IV. Seventeen studies were retrospectively designed and 11 studies were prospectively designed. Proposed results ranged from a wide variety of subjective findings including clinical impression, radiographic analysis, synovial fluid analysis, gross pathology, and histopathology. Objective results, although infrequent, included force plate analysis and cadaveric biomechanical testing. CONCLUSIONS: At this time, the application of evidence-based medicine in analyzing the current available evidence suggests that there is not a single surgical procedure that has enough data to recommend that it can consistently return dogs to normal function after CCL injury. The requirement for assessing and categorizing the available evidence becomes increasingly important as more data becomes available and the quality of research improves. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: An evidence-based medicine paradigm did not provide sufficient evidence favoring 1 surgical technique for management of canine CCL injury.},

The analysis consisted of the following: study design rating, quality factor rating, quantity rating, consistency rating, relevance to disease risk reduction rating, and cumulative strength of evidence ranking. RESULTS: 4 trials evaluating meloxicam were rated as type I. Three trials evaluating carprofen were rated as type I, and 2 trials were rated as type III. One trial evaluating each of the following agents was rated as type 1: etodolac; P54FP; polysulfated glycosaminoglycan; and a combination of chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, and manganese ascorbate. Two trials evaluating pentosan polysulphate and 2 trails evaluating green-lipped mussels were rated as type I. One trial evaluating hyaluronan was rated as type III. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A high level of comfort exists for meloxicam that the claimed relationship is scientifically valid and that its use is clinically efficacious for the treatment of osteoarthritis in dogs. A moderate level of comfort exists for carprofen; etodolac; pentosan polysulphate; green-lipped mussels; P54FP; polysulfated glycosaminoglycans; and a combination of chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, and manganese ascorbate. An extremely low level of comfort exists for hyaluronan.},

	abstract = {The study was carried out to elaborate response surface models through broiler performance data recovered from literature in order to predict performance and develop economic analysis. Three hundred and twenty eight studies published between 2005 and 2009 were retrieved using the systematic review of literature method. Average weight gain and feed intake data were collected from twelve studies that fulfilled the preestablished inclusion criteria, and response surface models were adjusted with metabolizable energy, environmental temperature, and slaughter age as independent variables. The models for weight gain (R²=0.88) and feed conversion (R²=0.87) were accurate, precise, and not biased. There was no interaction between metabolizable energy and environmental temperature on weight gain and feed intake. The independent variables age and temperature showed interaction for weight gain and feed conversion, whereas the interaction between age and metabolizable energy was detected only for weight gain. It was possible to elaborate economic analysis to determine maximum profit, as a function of the variables included in the model, in different market situations determined by changes in broiler and feed prices. Response surface models are effective to predict broiler chickens performance and allow the development of economic analysis to optimize profitability according to market prices.},

	abstract = {The honey bee Apis mellifera, the test species used in the current environmental risk assessment procedure, is generally considered as extremely sensitive to pesticides when compared to other bee species, although a quantitative approach for comparing the difference in sensitivity among bees has not yet been reported. A systematic review of the relevant literature on the topic followed by a meta-analysis has been performed. Both the contact and oral acute LD50 and the chronic LC50 reported in laboratory studies for as many substances as possible have been extracted from the papers in order to compare the sensitivity to pesticides of honey bees and other bee species (Apiformes). The sensitivity ratio R between the endpoint for the species a (A. mellifera) and the species s (bees other than A. mellifera) was calculated for a total of 150 case studies including 19 bee species. A ratio higher than 1 indicated that the species s was more sensitive to pesticides than honey bees. The meta-analysis showed a high variability of sensitivity among bee species (R from 0.001 to 2085.7), however, in approximately 95 \% of the cases the sensitivity ratio was below 10. The effect of pesticides in domestic and wild bees is dependent on the intrinsic sensitivity of single bee species as well as their specific life cycle, nesting activity and foraging behaviour. Current data indicates a need for more comparative information between honey bees and non-Apis bees as well as separate pesticide risk assessment procedures for non-Apis bees.},

	abstract = {The collective treatment (CT) of an affected herd is commonly advised to control bovine digital dermatitis (DD). Several CT are commercialized, frequently without major evidence supporting their effectiveness. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the published evidence that supports CT in the treatment and prevention of DD lesions in dairy herds. Across the evidence, the main limitations in the studies design were identified and the possible sources of inconsistency were investigated. An extensive literature search of publications through electronic databases and gray literature was conducted between July 2015 and January 2016. Studies that did not include an untreated or placebo control group were excluded from the review. The literature search and screening process identified 13 publications with 24 treatment trial comparisons and 18 prevention trial comparisons. The published evidence included studies mostly considered to have a low or unclear risk of bias. Descriptive analyses were performed according to the prevention and treatment outcomes, and case and success definitions were identified for each study and summarized in odds ratios (OR). Pairwise meta-analyses were conducted according to the prevention and treatment outcomes, comparing directly the intervention used in each study, and ignoring any other differences in the intervention characteristics. The results of the meta-analyses indicated a low degree of heterogeneity across the evidence for the prevention outcome [I2 = 0\%, 95\% CI: 0 to 37.2\%, 95\% prediction interval (PI): 0.72 to 1.74)] and a moderate degree for the treatment outcome (I2 = 25.3\%, 95\% CI: 0 to 63\%, 95\% PI: 0.39 to 3.73). Similarly, appraisal of the graphical L'Abbe plot suggested a considerable degree of heterogeneity across the evidence for the treatment outcome. For both outcomes, the frequent small sample sizes of the trials indicate imprecision across the included studies. Additionally, for the treatment and prevention outcomes, an asymmetric funnel plot suggested possible publication bias. The overall quality of the evidence, for both outcomes (prevention and treatment), was therefore considered to be low, indicating that the true effect of CT may be substantially different from that estimated across the included studies. Consequently, this review and meta-analysis does not support an association between the CT considered in the review and a beneficial effect in the prevention and treatment of DD lesions. The effectiveness of CT therefore remains uncertain, and the epidemiological circumstances in which it can be useful must be investigated. These findings highlight the importance of developing high quality, controlled trials to evaluate the effectiveness of CT for DD control.},

	abstract = {The prenatal period is of critical importance in defining how individuals respond to their environment throughout life. Stress experienced by pregnant females has been shown to have detrimental effects on offspring biology in humans and a variety of other species. It also is becoming increasingly apparent that prenatal events can have important consequences for the behavior, health, and productivity of offspring in farmed species. Pregnant cattle may experience many potentially important stressors, for instance, relating to their social environment, housing system and physical environment, interactions with humans and husbandry procedures, and their state of health. We examined the available literature to provide a review of the implications of prenatal stress for offspring welfare in cattle. The long-term effects of dystocia on cattle offspring also are reviewed. To ensure a transparent and repeatable selection process, a systematic review approach was adopted. The research literature clearly demonstrates that prenatal stress and difficult births in beef and dairy cattle both have implications for offspring welfare and performance. Common husbandry practices, such as transport, were shown to influence offspring biology and the importance of environmental variables, including thermal stress and drought, also were highlighted. Maternal disease during pregnancy was shown to negatively impact offspring welfare. Moreover, dystocia-affected calves suffer increased mortality and morbidity, decreased transfer of passive immunity, and important physiological and behavioral changes. This review also identified considerable gaps in our knowledge and understanding of the effects of prenatal stress in cattle.},

	abstract = {Over time, much knowledge has been accumulated about the active role of the urothelium, principally in rodents and human. Far from being a mere passive barrier, this specialized epithelium can alter the ion and protein composition of the urine, is able to sense and respond to mechanical stimuli such as pressure, and react to mechanical stimuli by epithelial cell communication with the nervous system. Most of the specialized functions of the urothelium are linked to a number of morpho-physiologic properties exhibited by the superficial umbrella cells, including specialized membrane lipids, asymmetric unit membrane particles and a plasmalemma with stiff plaques which function as a barrier to most substances found in urine, thus protecting the underlying tissues. Moreover, the entire mucosa lining the low urinary tract, composed of urothelium and sub-urothelium, forms a functional transduction unit, able to respond to eso- and endogenous physical and chemical stimuli in a manner assuring an adequate functional response. This review will summarize the available information on each area of inquiry from a morpho-functional point of view. Possible considerations pertaining to species of veterinary interest are reviewed as well. The review was prepared consulting the electronic databases PubMed and Cab Abstracts and retrieving all pertinent reports and the relative reference lists, in order to identify any potential additional studies that could be included. Full-length research articles and thematic reviews were considered. Information on the urothelium of some domestic animal species was also included.},

Two independent reviewers completed relevancy screening, data extraction, and synthesis of results using Kirkpatrick and Kirkpatrick's framework. The search retrieved 1,583 articles, and 10 met the final inclusion criteria. We identified no published articles on Web-based communication platforms in veterinary medicine; however, publications summarized from human medicine demonstrated that WBL provides a potentially reliable and valid approach for teaching and assessing communication skills. Student feedback on the use of virtual patients for teaching clinical communication skills has been positive, though evidence has suggested that practice with virtual patients prompted lower relation-building responses. Empirical outcomes indicate that WBL is a viable method for expanding the approach to teaching history taking and possibly to additional tasks of the veterinary medical interview.},

The effect of maternal nutrition can be exerted at all stages of fetal development, from conception until birth. A meta-analysis of maternal nutrition effects on the growth and reproductive development of male sheep offspring was undertaken using sixteen sheep studies. Eleven studies were included for prediction of the growth curves using a logistic growth model, and eleven studies were included for reproductive development and analysed using a mixed model. The meta-analysis suggested that, male sheep offspring undernourished during gestation had a significantly slower growth and lower testosterone levels while there were no statistically significant effects on testis weight, seminiferous tubule diameter or Sertoli cell count. The lack of a statistical effect on seminiferous tubule diameter and Sertoli cell count may be due to the limited number of studies examining the effects of maternal nutrition during pregnancy on male sheep offspring reproductive development. The meta-analysis reported here suggests that additional studies are warranted to more conclusively determine whether maternal nutrition during pregnancy effects male sheep growth and reproductive development.},

	abstract = {Vector-borne diseases are among major health constraints of small ruminant in Ethiopia. While various studies on single vector-borne diseases or presence of vectors have been conducted, no summarized evidence is available on the occurrence of these diseases and the related vectors. This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive summary on major vectors and vector-borne diseases in small ruminants in Ethiopia. Search for published and unpublished literature was conducted between 8th of January and 25th of June 2015. The search was both manual and electronic. The databases used in electronic search were PubMed, Web of Science, CAB Direct and AJOL. For most of the vector-borne diseases, the summary was limited to narrative synthesis due to lack of sufficient data. Meta-analysis was computed for trypanosomosis and dermatophilosis while meta-regression and sensitivity analysis was done only for trypanososmosis due to lack of sufficient reports on dermatophilosis. Owing emphasis to their vector role, ticks and flies were summarized narratively at genera/species level. In line with inclusion criteria, out of 106 initially identified research reports 43 peer-reviewed articles passed the quality assessment. Data on 7 vector-borne diseases were extracted at species and region level from each source. Accordingly, the pooled prevalence estimate of trypanosomosis was 3.7\% with 95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.8, 4.9), while that of dermatophilosis was 3.1\% (95\% CI: 1.6, 6.0). The in-between study variance noted for trypanosomosis was statistically significant (p{\textless}0.05). Among the three covariates considered for meta-regression, only one (species) fitted the final model significantly (p{\textless}0.05) and explained 65.44\% of the between studies variance (R2). The prevalence in sheep (5.5\%) increased nearly by 34\% compared to goats (2.9\%). The parasitic presence in blood was documented for babesiosis (3.7\% in goats); and anaplasmosis (3.9\% in sheep). Serological evidence was retrieved for bluetongue ranging from 34.1\% to 46.67\% in sheep, and coxiellosis was 10.4\% in goats. There was also molecular evidence on the presence of theileriosis in sheep (93\%, n=160) and goats (1.9\%, n=265). Regarding vectors of veterinary importance, 14 species of ticks in five genera, four species of Glossina and 4 genera of biting flies were reported. Despite the evidence on presence of various vectors including ticks, flies, mosquitoes and midges, studies on vector-borne diseases in Ethiopia are surprisingly rare, especially considering risks related to climate change, which is likely to affect distribution of vectors. Thus better evidence on the current situation is urgently needed in order to prevent spread and to model future distribution scenarios.},

	abstract = {Mange mites are economically important ectoparasites of sheep and goats responsible for rejection or downgrading of skins in tanneries or leather industries in Ethiopia. The objective of this systematic review was to compute the pooled prevalence estimate and identify factors influencing mange mite prevalence in sheep and goats at national level based on the available research evidence. Articles on mange mite infestation of small ruminants in Ethiopia were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, Google scholar and African journals on-line. The review was based on 18 cross-sectional studies carried out between 2003 and 2015 in four administrative states of Ethiopia. Accordingly, the pooled prevalence estimate in a random effects meta-analysis was estimated to be 4.4\% (95\% CI 3.0, 6.3) although there were evidence of a substantial amount of between-study variance (I(2)=98.4\%). In subgroup and multivariable meta-regression analyses, animal species, agro-ecology and administrative state were found to have significant effect on the prevalence estimate (P{\textless}0.05) and explained 32.87\% of the explainable proportion of the heterogeneity noted between studies The prevalence was found to be higher in goats in lowland agro-ecology. Region wise the highest estimate was calculated for Amhara (6.4\%) followed by Oromia (4.7\%), Tigray (3.6\%) and Southern Nations, Nationalities and People Region (SNNPR) (3.1\%). Significant difference was noted between Amhara and SNNPR. The study further revealed that mites of the genus Sarcoptes, Demodex and Psoroptes are the most prevalent mites infesting small ruminants in Ethiopia. Valid studies were lacking from five regional states. As some of these regions are known for their large small ruminant population, further studies are warranted to produce better picture of the infestation at a national level. Meanwhile, the need for monitoring the ongoing control intervention is suggested.},

It also attempts to identify study-level variables that could explain the variation in apparent seroprevalence. The literature search was restricted to studies published in English language from January 2000 to December 2013. A template was designed to retrieve the most biologically plausible and consistent variables from the articles. A total of 29 published papers containing 40 animal-level studies were used in the analyses. The single-group summary of Brucella seroprevalence in cattle was estimated to reach 3.3 \% with 95 \% confidence interval (CI) (2.6-4.2 \%). Of all the variables considered, region was the only specific factor identified to explain about 20 \% of between-study variation. Accordingly, the region-based meta-analysis forest plot revealed the highest prevalence in central Ethiopia followed by southern part. The lowest prevalence estimate was observed in the western part of the country. The visual inspection of the funnel plot demonstrated the presence of possible publication bias which might dictate shortage of studies with higher prevalences or variance inflation due to infectiousness of Brucella. In conclusion, the quantitative review showed the seroprevalence to be low but widely distributed. More importantly, the review underscores the need for isolation and characterization of the circulating Brucella spp. to capture the type of Brucella spp. involved and its distribution in cattle in Ethiopia.},

The reported GI nematodes represented eleven genera affecting sheep and goats including: Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus, Teladorsagia/Ostertagia, Strongyloides, Bunostomum, Nematodirus, Chabertia, Trichuris, Cooperia, Skrjabinema and Oesophagostomum. The GI nematodes pooled prevalence estimate in the random effect model was 75.8\% (95\% CI: 69.6, 80.8). The subgroup analysis revealed significant (p{\textless}0.05) differences in the prevalence between different regions and type of diagnostic methods used. 'Postmortem technique' and 'eastern part of the country' were associated with higher GI nematode prevalence and accounted for 68.1\% of the between studies heterogeneity. In light of the high parasitic prevalence in all agro-ecologies, the need for strategic intervention is recommended. Meanwhile, data need to be generated for some of the regions where dependable survey reports are lacking.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis, using information from 45 experiments on growing-finishing pigs published in 39 manuscripts, was carried out to determine the simultaneous effects of the physical environment (space allowance, group size, flooring conditions, temperature, presence of enrichment), pig traits (initial body weight (BW) for each studied time interval, sex, genetics), feeder characteristics (water provision within the feeder, feeder design (individual/collective), feeder places/pig, presence of feeder protection) and feed characteristics (feed allowance (ad libitum/restricted), net energy content, crude protein (CP) content), as well as their potential interactions, on the feeding behaviour and performance of growing-finishing pigs. The detrimental effect of low temperature on performance was particularly evident for restricted-fed pigs (P {\textless} 0.05). At reduced feeder space allowance, a reduction in the percentage of time spent eating was predicted when increasing initial BW, whereas the opposite was predicted for larger feeder space allowances (P {\textless} 0.001). The reduction in visit duration to the feeder in higher BW groups became gradually more important with increasing feeder space allowance (P {\textless} 0.01), whereas the increase in the ingestion rate and average daily feed intake (ADFI) with increasing initial BW became smaller with increasing feeder space (P {\textless} 0.05). The model predicted a reduction in feed conversion ratio (FCR) with increasing group size (P {\textless} 0.05) and floor space allowance (P {\textless} 0.01) and on solid floors with or without bedding (P {\textless} 0.05). In comparison with other feeders, wet/dry feeders were associated with more frequent but shorter feeder visits (P {\textless} 0.05), higher ingestion rates (P {\textless} 0.001) and higher ADFI (P {\textless} 0.10). The use of protection within individual feeders increased the time spent feeding (P {\textless} 0.001), reduced the number of visits per day (P {\textless} 0.01), the ingestion rate (P {\textless} 0.001) and FCR (P {\textless} 0.01) in comparison with other feeder types. Sex modulated the effect of the number of feeder places/pig on FCR (P {\textless} 0.05), with a gradual reduction of FCR in entire males and females when increasing feeder space allowance. Genetics tended to modulate the effect of diets' CP content on FCR (P {\textless} 0.10). Overall, these results may contribute to the improvement of the welfare and performance of growing-finishing pigs by a better knowledge of the influence of the rearing environment and may help optimize the feeding strategies in current production systems.},

Data from 22 experiments reported in 21 scientific publications were collected. The space allowance, expressed on an allometric basis by means of a \_k\_-value (m²/BW⁰[super:.]⁶⁶⁷), the group size (\_n\_) and the floor characteristics (fully and partly slatted \_v.\_ non-slatted floor), as well as their significant two-way interactions were used as fixed effects, and the experiment was used as a random factor to take into account the interexperiment effect. Further regression analyses were performed on the predicted values of observations in order to improve the adjustment of data. A significant quadratic relationship was established between space allowance (\_k\_-value, \_P\_{\textless}0.05; squared \_k\_-value, \_P\_{\textless}0.01) and the percentage of time spent lying. A significant interaction between the \_k\_-value and the floor type was also found (\_P\_{\textless}0.05), showing that the relationship between space allowance and lying behaviour is affected by the presence or absence of slats. Threshold \_k\_-values were obtained using broken-line analyses, being about 0.039 for slatted floors and almost double for non-slatted floors. Compared to other studies, these values suggest that the ability to rest as space availability decreases may be compromised before a reduced performance becomes apparent. Group size did not show a significant effect. Additional information should be added to the model, as further data become available, to adjust the proposed parameters as well as to try to include the effect of other important aspects such as that of ambient temperature.},

	abstract = {To quantify the combined effect of housing conditions and environmental enrichment on the behaviour and performance of pigs, a meta-analysis was performed using information from 45 experiments in 42 published manuscripts. Multiple regression models were applied to evaluate the effects of space allowance per pig (\_k\_-value; m²/BW⁰[super:.]⁶⁶⁷), group size (\_n\_), floor characteristics (solid, partly, or totally slatted floor), bedding (presence or absence), and the number and presentation sequence of point-source objects (no object, one object, two simultaneous objects, two alternated objects, three or more simultaneous objects or three or more alternated objects) on the general activity, enrichment and object-directed exploratory behaviour, social behaviour, and productive performance. A non-linear relationship between space allowance per pig and time spent sitting and lying was found (\_P\_{\textless}0.10 and \_P\_{\textless}0.01 for the \_k\_-value and its quadratic term respectively). Total time spent in exploration increased with space allowance per pig when bedding was present (\_P\_{\textless}0.01), and time spent exploring other pen items decreased with increasing space allowance per pig if no bedding was provided (\_P\_{\textless}0.001). Total time spent in exploration increased with group size (\_P\_{\textless}0.001). The lowest predicted total exploration time (least squares mean+or-standard error) was found in the absence of bedding and point-source objects (13+or-3\%; \_P\_{\textless}0.05), and the highest when bedding (18+or-3\%) or point-source objects (19+or-3\%) were present. Time exploring point-source objects was higher when different objects were provided (\_P\_{\textless}0.001). Suspended (\_P\_{\textless}0.05) and deformable (\_P\_{\textless}0.05) enrichment items increased the time spent manipulating them. Time spent exploring point-source objects was predicted to be higher in the absence of slats and bedding (32+or-6\%; \_P\_{\textless}0.05), and lower when bedding (8+or-9\%) or slats (12+or-4\%) were present. Time engaged in negative social behaviours decreased in the presence of point-source objects (\_P\_{\textless}0.01), and increased with group size in the absence of bedding (\_P\_{\textless}0.001). Time engaged in positive social behaviours tended to decrease in the presence of point-source objects (\_P\_{\textless}0.10), and when space allowance per pig increased in the absence of bedding (\_P\_{\textless}0.10). Slight trends towards lower FCR were predicted when point-source objects (\_P\_{\textless}0.10) and bedding (\_P\_=0.10) were present.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in calves and piglets lead to significant economic losses in livestock husbandry. A high morbidity has been reported for diarrhea (calves {\textless}/= 35\%; piglets {\textless}/= 50\%) and for respiratory diseases (calves {\textless}/= 80\%; piglets {\textless}/= 40\%). Despite a highly diverse etiology and pathophysiology of these diseases, treatment with antimicrobials is often the first-line therapy. Multi-antimicrobial resistance in pathogens results in international accordance to strengthen the research in novel treatment options. Medicinal plants bear a potential as alternative or additional treatment. Based on the versatile effects of their plant specific multi-component-compositions, medicinal plants can potentially act as 'multi-target drugs'. Regarding the plurality of medicinal plants, the aim of this systematic review was to identify potential medicinal plant species for prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases and for modulation of the immune system and inflammation in calves and piglets. RESULTS: Based on nine initial sources including standard textbooks and European ethnoveterinary studies, a total of 223 medicinal plant species related to the treatment of gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases was identified. A defined search strategy was established using the PRISMA statement to evaluate 30 medicinal plant species starting from 20'000 peer-reviewed articles published in the last 20 years (1994-2014). This strategy led to 418 references (257 in vitro, 84 in vivo and 77 clinical trials, thereof 48 clinical trials in veterinary medicine) to evaluate effects of medicinal plants and their efficacy in detail. The findings indicate that the most promising candidates for gastrointestinal diseases are Allium sativum L., Mentha x piperita L. and Salvia officinalis L.; for diseases of the respiratory tract Echinacea purpurea (L.) MOENCH, Thymus vulgaris L. and Althea officinalis L. were found most promising, and Echinacea purpurea (L.) MOENCH, Camellia sinensis (L.) KUNTZE, Glycyrrhiza glabra L. and Origanum vulgare L. were identified as best candidates for modulation of the immune system and inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Several medicinal plants bear a potential for novel treatment strategies for young livestock. There is a need for further research focused on gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases in calves and piglets, and the findings of this review provide a basis on plant selection for future studies.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Foodborne diseases caused by non-typhoid Salmonella and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance remain as a public health challenge, especially in developing countries. The current study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence and the antimicrobial resistance patterns of non-typhoid Salmonella in Ethiopia. METHODS: Literature search was conducted from major electronic databases and indexing services. Both published and unpublished studies addressing the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance profiles of Salmonella in Ethiopia from 2010 to 2020 and those studies reported sample size and the numbers of isolates/number of positive samples were included in the study. Data were extracted using format prepared in Microsoft Excel. The identified data were exported to EndNote to remove duplicated studies, then after the remained articles were screened using title, abstract, and full text to identify studies that meet the inclusion criteria and finally appraised for methodological validity using JBI guideline. The pooled prevalence of Salmonella and its drug resistance pattern was computed by a random-effects model. I(2) test statistic was used to test heterogeneity across studies. The presence of publication bias was evaluated using the Begg's and Egger's tests. RESULTS: A total of 49 eligible articles, 33 of them on human stools, 15 of them on animal origin foods, and one both on human stools and animal origin foods, were included in the study. The pooled prevalence of Salmonella among human stools and animal origin foods in Ethiopia was 4.8\% (95\% CI: 3.9, 5.9) and 7.7\% (95\% CI: 5.6, 10.4), respectively. The subgroup analysis detected high pooled prevalence, 7.6\% (95\% CI: 5.3, 10.7) among outpatients and low, 3.7\% (95\% CI: 2.6, 5.1) in food handlers. The pooled resistant level of Salmonella was 80.6\% (95\% CI 72.6, 86.7) for ampicillin and 63.5\% (95\% CI 53.7, 72.4) for tetracycline. Low pooled resistance pattern was reported in ciprofloxacin, 8.7\% (95\% CI 5.6, 13.3) and ceftriaxone 12.2\% (95\% CI 7.9, 18.3). There was some sort of publication bias. CONCLUSION: High pooled prevalence of Salmonella among human stools and animal origin foods which were 4.8\% and 7.7\% respectively, and high Salmonella resistance, {\textgreater}72\% to ampicillin and tetracycline were detected in Ethiopia.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Robopets are small animal-like robots which have the appearance and behavioural characteristics of pets. OBJECTIVE: To bring together the evidence of the experiences of staff, residents and family members of interacting with robopets and the effects of robopets on the health and well-being of older people living in care homes. DESIGN: Systematic review of qualitative and quantitative research. DATA SOURCES: We searched 13 electronic databases from inception to July 2018 and undertook forward and backward citation chasing. METHODS: Eligible studies reported the views and experiences of robopets from residents, family members and staff (qualitative studies using recognised methods of qualitative data collection and analysis) and the effects of robopets on the health and well-being of care home residents (randomised controlled trials, randomised crossover trials and cluster randomised trials). Study selection was undertaken independently by two reviewers. We used the Wallace criteria and the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool to assess the quality of the evidence. We developed a logic model with stakeholders and used this as a framework to guide data extraction and synthesis. Where appropriate, we used meta-analysis to combine effect estimates from quantitative studies. RESULTS: Nineteen studies (10 qualitative, 2 mixed methods and 7 randomised trials) met the inclusion criteria. Interactions with robopets were described as having a positive impact on aspects of well-being including loneliness, depression and quality of life by residents and staff, although there was no corresponding statistically significant evidence from meta-analysis for these outcomes. Meta-analysis showed evidence of a reduction in agitation with the robopet "Paro" compared to control (-0.32 [95\% CI -0.61 to -0.04, p = 0.03]). Not everyone had a positive experience of robopets. CONCLUSIONS: Engagement with robopets appears to have beneficial effects on the health and well-being of older adults living in care homes, but not all chose to engage. Whether the benefits can be sustained are yet to be investigated. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Robopets have the potential to benefit people living in care homes, through increasing engagement and interaction. With the robopet acting as a catalyst, this engagement and interaction may afford comfort and help reduce agitation and loneliness.},

This study investigated the pooled prevalence pattern and risk factors of WNV infection among humans and animals in Nigeria. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of eligible studies published in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science from January 1, 1950 to August 30, 2020. Peer-reviewed cross-sectional studies describing WNV infections in humans and animals were systematically reviewed. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane Q statistic. RESULTS: Eighteen out of 432 available search output were eligible and included for this study. Of which 13 and 5 were WNV studies on humans and animals, respectively. Although 61.5\% of the human studies had a low risk of bias, they all had high heterogeneity. The South West geopolitical zone of Nigeria had the highest pooled prevalence of anti-WNV immunoglobulin M (IgM; 7.8\% in humans). The pooled seroprevalence of anti-WNV IgM and immunoglobulin G (IgG) was 7.1\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 5.9 to 8.3) and 76.5\% (95\% CI, 74.0 to 78.8), respectively. The WNV RNA prevalence was 1.9\% (95\% CI, 1.4 to 2.9), while 14.3\% (95\% CI, 12.9 to 15.8) had WNV-neutralizing antibodies. In animals, the pooled seroprevalence of anti-WNV IgM and IgG was 90.3\% (95\% CI, 84.3 to 94.6) and 3.5\% (95\% CI, 1.9 to 5.8), respectively, while 20.0\% (95\% CI, 12.9 to 21.4) had WNV-neutralizing antibodies.

	abstract = {Brucellosis, known as Malta fever or Mediterranean fever, is one of the most common bacterial zoonotic diseases caused by Brucella spp. which can result in serious health issues. The objective of the present study was to systematically review and summarize the studies regarding the prevalence of Brucella spp. in milk and milk products in the Middle East region. Some international databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, and Google Scholar) were searched to retrieve relevant reports published between 1 January 2008 and 30th October 2018. After assessing for eligibility, 30 articles containing 9281 samples, were included in the current study. The highest number of publications were found in Iran and Turkey (n = 12 and 7, respectively), while Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Syria had the lowest number of publications (n = 1). Besides, the highest and lowest prevalence was observed in Kuwait (62\%) and Egypt (15\%), respectively. The highest and lowest overall prevalence of Brucella spp. in milk was found in raw cow milk 36\% (95\%CI: 28-54\%) and raw buffalo milk 13\% (95\%CI: -22-48\%), respectively. The overall prevalence in cheese estimated to be 9\% (95\%CI: -16-35\%). The overall prevalence of Brucella spp. in dairy products in the Middle East was estimated to be 29\% (95\%CI: 23-35\%). The results indicate that more risk management plans are needed to reduce the incidence of Brucella spp. in dairy products in the Middle East, especially in cow milk.},

	abstract = {The aim of the current research was to systematically review and summarize the studies that evaluated the concentration of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) in cow milk in different regions of Iran and to perform a meta-analysis of the findings. Moreover, the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks of Pb and Cd through milk consumption in adult and child consumers were assessed. As a result of a systematic search in the international and national databases between January 2008 and October 2018, 17 reports involving 1874 samples were incorporated in our study for meta-analysis. The pooled concentrations of Pb and Cd were estimated to be 13.95 μg mL(-1) (95\% CI 9.72-18.11 μg mL(-1)) and 3.55 μg mL(-1) (95\% CI - 2.38-9.48 μg mL(-1)), respectively, which were lower than the WHO/FAO and national standard limits. The estimated weekly intake (EWI) of Pb and Cd through consuming milk was 16.65 and 7 μg day(-1) for adults of 70 kg and 45 and 34 μg day(-1) for children of 26 kg, respectively, which was well below the risk values set by Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA). The maximum target hazard quotient values (THQs) of Pb and Cd were 5.55E-5 and 5.55E-5 for adults and 5.55E-5 and 5.55E-5 for children, respectively, which were lower than 1 value, suggesting that Iranian consumers are not exposed to non-carcinogenic risk through consuming milk. Moreover, the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) of Pb estimated to be 2.96E-04 in adults and 1.0E-03 in children, indicating that consumers in Iran are at threshold carcinogenic risk of Pb through consuming milk (ILCR {\textgreater} 10(-4)). Therefore, planning and policy making for the sustainable reduction of these toxic metals in milk, particularly in industrial regions of Iran, are crucial.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rabies is a fatal disease that still kills 2-6 people a year in Iran. A meta-analysis was conducted in order to generate accurate data on animal bite exposure, and to estimate the incidence of animal bite across the country. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Major national and international electronic databases were searched using the keywords "animal bite," rabies, prevalence, incidence, and Iran. Web of Knowledge, PubMed, Scopus, Ovid, and ScienceDirect were used as international databases, and the national databases included Science Information Database, MagIran, and IranDoc. Descriptive cross-sectional studies addressing the incidence of animal bite were selected and screened by two authors, and pre-specified data were extracted. The population of provinces or cities of studies was extracted from the Statistical Centre of Iran. The overall incidence of animal bite in Iran was estimated using a random-effects model with 95\% confidence interval (CI). Study quality was assessed using the STROBE recommended checklist. RESULTS: A total of 34 studies were selected for the meta-analysis out of 1215 retrieved studies. The number of animal bites in the studies during 1993-2013 was 230,019 cases. The overall estimated incidence rate of animal bite in Iran was 13.20/1000 (95\%, CI 12.10, 14.30) and the mean age of people was 26.23 (SD = 5.02) year. The incidence rate of animal bite among males (14.90/1000) was much higher than females (4.55/1000), and was higher in rural areas (17.45/1000) compared with urban areas (4.35/1000). The incident rate was highest among students compared with other reported occupations. The incidence rate of dogs was 10.40/1000 followed by cats, cows, wolves, jackals, and foxes. Domestic animals had a higher incidence rate than stray and wild animals. The incidence rate of animal bite during spring was 4.90/1000; however, the incidence rate in other seasons had no significant difference. In the retrieved studies, the highest incidence rate of animal bite was found in the West Azerbaijan Province (146.83/1000). CONCLUSION: The current study is the first comprehensive analysis of the published animal bite studies in Iran. Accurate data on animal bite incidence may lead to more effective policy-decisions towards more efficient resource allocation to primary health care for reducing rabies case. Such information is a primary and major necessity for rabies control program in the country. Animal bite reduction can significantly minimize the risk of rabies infection, thereby reducing public health costs for the expensive post-exposure treatment.},

	abstract = {Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by the intracellular bacterium, Coxiella burnetii. Its primary mode of transmission is by inhalation of aerosols originating from infected animals and contaminated environments. The organism has a very low infective dose, can persist in the environment for long periods of time and large outbreaks fuelled by windborne spread have been previously reported. Detection of C. burnetii in the environment is therefore important during human and animal outbreak investigations and for the control and prevention of Q fever. This study aimed to systematically review and critically appraise the published literature on sampling methods used to detect C. burnetii from different environmental samples. A search of four electronic databases with subsequent hand searching identified 47 eligible articles published since 1935. These articles described sampling of dust, air, soil and liquids in attempts to detect C. burnetii during 19 Q fever outbreaks and in 28 endemic settings. Environmental positivity was most commonly associated with ruminant livestock populations. Evidence describing spatio-temporal characteristics and associated geographical dispersion gradients was limited. The most commonly tested sample type was dust which also yielded the highest bacterial loads of {\textgreater}10(8) bacteria/cloth. The MD8 (Sartorius) air sampler was used widely for air sampling. Soil was the only sample type for which a validated laboratory protocol was established specifically for C. burnetii. Each environmental sample type has its advantages and limitations which are discussed in detail and a simplified framework to guide decisions around environmental sampling for C. burnetii is provided. In any type of environmental sampling, it is recommended to use standardized and validated methods and to match the most ideal sampling strategy and timing with the research context. These conditions are essential to be considered when designing future Q fever management plans that involve environmental sampling for C. burnetii.},

	abstract = {The rise of anthelmintic resistance worldwide has led to the development of alternative control strategies for gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) infections, which are one of the main constraints on the health of grazing small ruminants. Presently, breeding schemes rely mainly on fecal egg count (FEC) measurements on infected animals which are time-consuming and requires expertise in parasitology. Identifying and understanding the role of immunoglobulins in the mechanisms of resistance could provide a more efficient and sustainable method of identifying nematode-resistant animals for selection. In this study we review the findings on immunoglobulin response to GIN in the literature published to date (june 2019) and discuss the potential to use immunoglobulins as biomarkers. The literature review revealed 41 studies which measured at least one immunoglobulin: 35 focused on lamb immune response (18 used non-naïve lambs) and 7 on yearlings. In this review we propose a conceptual model summarizing the role of immunoglobulins in resistance to GIN. We highlight the need for more carefully designed and documented studies to allow comparisons across different populations on the immunoglobulin response to GIN infection.},

	abstract = {The global burden of neurodegenerative disorders has increased substantially over the past 2 decades due to rising rates of population aging. Although neurodegenerative disorders differ in their clinical presentation, the underlying pathobiological processes are largely shared. Oxidative stress, among other mechanisms, is strongly implicated in neurodegenerative disorders and aging, and can potentially be targeted by antioxidative agents. Curcumin, a component of turmeric, is a compound that has received considerable attention for its therapeutic properties, and it is considered to be a powerful antioxidant. In this review, we analyzed the evidence for curcumin as an antioxidant in models of neurodegenerative disorders as well as oxido-nitrosative stress. A total of 1451 articles were found from 3 scientific literature databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science). After all exclusions, a final total of 64 articles were included in this review. The majority of the studies showed that curcumin, or derivatives thereof, were protective against oxidative and/or nitrosative stress in various cellular and animal models. Overall, curcumin protected against lipid and protein oxidation with a reduction in levels of malondialdehyde, and protein carbonyls, thiols and nitrotyrosines. Furthermore, it stimulated the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. In conclusion, curcumin appears to be a promising compound for phytomedicine. However, due to some concerns about its efficacy, further targeted experiments are needed to identify its exact molecular targets and pathways responsible for its antioxidant effects.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify which classification systems have been used for tumor margin reporting and to determine whether factors (publication year, tumor type, and specialty of the contributing authors) influenced trends in margin reporting within literature describing canine soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and cutaneous mast cell tumors (MCT). STUDY DESIGN: Systematic literature review. METHODS: Eligible articles were identified through electronic database searches performed for STS and MCT. Data abstracted from relevant studies included publication year, author list, specialty of contributing authors, criteria used to report the planned surgical margins, and the status of histologic margins. Categorization of papers was based on the classification systems used to report surgical and histologic tumor margins. RESULTS: Fifty-three articles were included, 11 on STS, 37 on MCT, and five that included both tumor types. Criteria for classifying the planned surgical margins were described in only 50.9\% of studies. Articles that listed a veterinary surgeon as a contributing author (P = .01) and STS articles compared to MCT papers (P = .01) were more likely to report surgical margins. Most (56.6\%) studies reported the status of histologic margins dichotomously as "complete" or "incomplete." Although a previously published consensus statement recommended that quantitative criteria be used to report histologic margins, only 7.5\% of articles used quantitative methods. CONCLUSION: Classification systems used for reporting tumor margins were highly variable among studies. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The findings of this review provide evidence that a standardized classification system for reporting surgical and histologic tumor margins is required in veterinary medicine. A universal system may support more consistent reporting of neoplastic biopsy specimens and allow for more meaningful comparisons across research studies.},

	abstract = {The virulence-transmission trade-off hypothesis proposed more than 30 years ago is the cornerstone in the study of host-parasite co-evolution. This hypothesis rests on the premise that virulence is an unavoidable and increasing cost because the parasite uses host resources to replicate. This cost associated with replication ultimately results in a deceleration in transmission rate because increasing within-host replication increases host mortality. Empirical tests of predictions of the hypothesis have found mixed support, which cast doubt about its overall generalizability. To quantitatively address this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis of 29 empirical studies, after reviewing over 6000 published papers, addressing the four core relationships between (1) virulence and recovery rate, (2) within-host replication rate and virulence, (3) within-host replication and transmission rate, and (4) virulence and transmission rate. We found strong support for an increasing relationship between replication and virulence, and replication and transmission. Yet, it is still uncertain if these relationships generally decelerate due to high within-study variability. There was insufficient data to quantitatively test the other two core relationships predicted by the theory. Overall, the results suggest that the current empirical evidence provides partial support for the trade-off hypothesis, but more work remains to be done.},

Using paired samples of females' blood (n = 564) and their eggs (n = 1814) from 26 bird species in 6 taxonomic orders, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate whether maternal transfer of MeHg to eggs differed among species and caused differential toxicity risk to embryos. Total mercury (THg) concentrations in eggs increased with maternal blood THg concentrations; however, the proportion of THg transferred from females to their eggs differed among bird taxa and with maternal THg exposure. Specifically, a smaller proportion of maternal THg was transferred to eggs with increasing female THg concentrations. Additionally, the proportion of THg that was transferred to eggs at the same maternal blood THg concentration differed among taxonomic orders, with waterfowl (Anseriformes) transferring up to 382\% more THg into their eggs than songbirds (Passeriformes). We provide equations to predict THg concentrations in eggs using female blood THg concentrations, and vice versa, which may help translate toxicity benchmarks across tissues and life stages. Our results indicate that toxicity risk of MeHg can vary among bird taxa due to differences in maternal transfer of MeHg to offspring.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Climate change plays an important role in the geographic spread of zoonotic diseases. Knowing which populations are at risk of contracting these diseases is critical to informing public health policies and practices. In Québec, 14 zoonoses have been identified as important for public health to guide the climate change adaptation efforts of decision-makers and researchers. A great deal has been learned about these diseases in recent years, but information on at-risk workplaces remains incomplete. The objective of this study is to paint a portrait of the occupations and sectors of economic activity at risk for the acquisition of these zoonoses. METHODS: A rapid review of the scientific literature was conducted. Databases on the Ovid and EBSCO research platforms were searched for articles published between 1995 and 2018, in English and French, on 14 zoonoses (campylobacteriosis, cryptosporidiosis, verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli, giardiasis, listeriosis, salmonellosis, Eastern equine encephalitis, Lyme disease, West Nile virus, food botulism, Q fever, avian and swine influenza, rabies, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) and occupational health. The literature search retrieved 12,558 articles and, after elimination of duplicates, 6,838 articles were evaluated based on the title and the abstract. Eligible articles had to address both concepts of the research issue (prioritized zoonoses and worker health). Of the 621 articles deemed eligible, 110 were selected following their full reading. RESULTS: Of the diseases under study, enteric zoonoses were the most frequently reported. Agriculture, including veterinary services, public administration services and medical and social services were the sectors most frequently identified in the literature. CONCLUSION: The results of our study will support public health authorities and decision-makers in targeting those sectors and occupations that are particularly at risk for the acquisition of zoonoses. Doing so will ultimately optimize the public health practices of those responsible for the health of workers.},

Databases used: Pertinent literature was searched with PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Universitatsbibliothek Basel (swissbib Basel Bern) and Google Scholar. The search was then refined manually based first on article titles and abstracts, and subsequently on full texts. Conclusions: Of the four classical acute nociceptive models used for NTT, thermal and mechanical are most commonly used in cats. Thermal stimulation is applicable in experimental settings and has been used in pharmacodynamics studies assessing feline antinociception. Although mechanical stimulation is currently less used in cats, in the future it might play a role in the evaluation of clinical feline pain. However, the low response reliability after stimulus repetition within a narrow time interval represents a major limitation for the clinical use of mechanical thresholds in this species. Challenges remain when thermal thresholds are used to investigate analgesics that have the potential to affect skin temperature, such as opioids and a2-adrenergic agonists, and when a model of inflammatory pain is reproduced in experimental cats with the purpose of evaluating non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as analgesics.},

	abstract = {Ticks are a large group of parasitic arthropods which transmit pathogens to animals and humans, causing great economic losses. Chemical-based antitick measures include the use of pyrethroids, carbamates, organophosphates, formamidines and macrocyclic lactones, which all have associated costs, resistance-development and environmental hazards. Some plant-based alternatives may have good efficacy, low toxicity and reduced environmental impacts. A review of published scientific articles was conducted for medicinal plants with in vitro tick repellent or acaricidal activities against immature and adult stages of ticks. Veterinary databases (All Databases, CAB Abstracts and Global Health, PubMed, Web of Science, BIOSIS Citation Index, Science Direct, Current Content Connect and Google Scholar) were used. The search words were "acaricidal", "tick repellent", "medicinal plants", "phytochemical constituents" and "antitick assays". To investigate correlations, meta-analysis was conducted using the Fixed-effect model in an Excel programme. The different plant parts, extractants used and their efficacies, where available are listed. Extracts of some species including Azadirachta indica, Gynandropsis gynandra, Lavandula angustifolia, Pelargonium roseum and Cymbopogon species have good acaricidal and larvicidal effects with 90-100\% efficacy, comparable to those of currently used synthetic acaricides. Bioassays used in the determination of repellent, acaricidal, larvicidal, inhibition of oviposition and hatchability include tick climbing repellency, Petri dish, larval packet and immersion tests amongst others. Using a total of 1 428, 1 924, 574, 281 and 68 events, the median efficiency value for acaricidal, larvicidal, egg hatching inhibition, inhibition of oviposition, repellency, acaricidal effects of the Lamiaceae and Asteraceae families were 80.12 (CI$_{\textrm{95\%}}$: 79.20-81.04), 86.05 (CI$_{\textrm{95\%}}$: 85.13-86.97), 83.39 (CI$_{\textrm{95\%}}$: 82.47-84.31), 53.01 (CI$_{\textrm{95\%}}$: 52.08-53.93), 92.00 (CI$_{\textrm{95\%}}$: 91.08-92.93), 80.79 (CI$_{\textrm{95\%}}$: 79.87-81.71) and 48.34\% (CI$_{\textrm{95\%}}$: 47.42-49.26) respectively. Among the 26 isolated active compounds identified, some such as azadirachtin, carvacrol, linalool, geraniol and citronellal and their potential uses are discussed. While plant species used in ethnoveterinary medicine hold vast potential as parasiticides, the variations in testing methodologies and assay conditions make comparison among studies very problematic. The standardization of components, extraction techniques and experimental design is urgently required to fully explore their potential.},

Therefore, we conducted a systematic review of studies on personality and attitude as risk factors for dairy cattle health, welfare, productivity, and farm management. Database searches captured 1,144 records, and 38 were finally included in the review. Thirty-three manuscripts assessed farmers' attitudes, 1 assessed their personalities, and 4 assessed both as risk factors. These potential risk factors were checked for relationships with more than 50 different outcome variables regarding farm management (17 manuscripts), animal health (13 manuscripts), animal productivity (11 manuscripts), and animal welfare (4 manuscripts). The approaches to assessing risk factors and processing and interpreting data varied greatly; thus, drawing conclusions regarding the effects of attitude and personality as risk factors is impeded because manuscripts are difficult to compare. Our findings highlight the need for harmonization of attitudes and personality assessments in future research. Furthermore, researchers should carefully consider which depth of detail to apply when planning and evaluating related research. Nevertheless, results highlight the importance of the effect of personality and attitude on outcomes. Farmers' personality and attitudes are associated with dairy cattle health, welfare, productivity, and management. In general, attitudes indicating higher degrees of technical knowledge, affection with problems, perceived responsibility, perception of control of a situation, a better human-animal relationship, or a positive evaluation of the benefits of management decisions tended to affect outcomes in a beneficial way. "Agreeableness" and "conscientiousness" were shown to promote better farm performance, whereas "neuroticism" had a negative effect. Therefore, further research on attitude and personality and their consideration by professionals and decision-makers within the dairy sector and politics is strongly recommended. This might provide the chance to better understand the needs of dairy farmers and therefore develop tailored advice and support strategies to improve both satisfactory and constructive cooperation.},

A literature search and systematic review was conducted to identify EO water intervention studies to reduce Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes on poultry, eggs, meat, fish and produce. Pathogen reduction data from the included studies were utilized in the estimation of effect sizes (mean log reductions) and heterogeneity assessment between studies (I$^{\textrm{2}}$). Twenty-seven studies (294 observations) were obtained and the sanitizers identified as controls were water and sodium hypochlorite. Summary effects of 0.66, 1.12, 1.15, 2.41, 4.45 and 5.34 log reductions were estimated for EO water treatments on poultry, fish, meats, lettuce, eggs and tomatoes, respectively. Highest reductions were estimated for smooth-surfaced foods (eggs, tomatoes) while pathogen reductions were lower on muscle foods. I$^{\textrm{2}}$ ranged between 60 and 99\%, indicating high heterogeneity and necessitating the use of meta-regressions to assess the variations. Free chlorine concentration (FCC), time and temperature were significant variables (p{\textless}0.05) in estimating EO water effectiveness, although no single variable was significant for all the products. The developed meta-regression models were applied to a selected treatment condition (30 mg/L FCC, 20 degrees C, 3 min) to attain 2.09, 5.27, 0.87 and 4.91 predicted log reductions on lettuce, tomatoes, meats and eggs, respectively.

	abstract = {Lameness is a serious concern in the dairy sector, reflecting its high incidence and impact on animal welfare and productivity. Research has provided figures on its frequency using different methodologies, making it difficult to compare results and hindering farm-level decision-making. The study's objectives were to determine the frequency levels of lameness in British dairy cattle through a meta-analysis approach, and to understand the chronological patterns of how lameness cases are detected and classified in scientific research. A systematic review was conducted using PRISMA-P guidelines for article selection. Random-effects models estimated the pooled frequency measure of lameness with heterogeneity managed through subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Sixty-eight papers were identified, 50 included prevalence and 36 incidence data. The pooled prevalence of lameness in British dairy cattle was estimated at 29.5\% (95\% CI 26.7-32.4\%) whilst all-cause lameness incidence rate indicated 30.9 cases of lameness per 100 cow-years (95\% CI 24.5-37.9). The pooled cause-specific lameness incidence rate per 100 cow-years was 66.1 (95\% CI 24.1-128.8) for white line disease, 53.2 (95\% CI 20.5-101.2) for sole ulcer, 53.6 (95\% CI 19.2-105.34) for digital dermatitis, with 51.9 (95\% CI 9.3-129.2) attributable to other lameness-related lesions. Heterogeneity levels remained high. Sixty-nine papers contributed to a chronological overview of lameness data source. Although the AHDB Dairy mobility scoring system (MSS) was launched in the UK in 2008 and adopted shortly after by the British Dairy sector as the standard tool for assessing lameness, other methods are used depending on the investigator. Automated lameness detection systems may offer a solution for the subjective nature of MSSs, yet it was utilized in one study only. Despite the recognition of under-reporting of lameness from farm records 22 (31.9\%) studies used this data source. The diversity of lameness data collection methods and sources was a key finding. It limits the understanding of lameness burden and the refinement of policy making for lameness. Standardizing case definition and research methods would improve knowledge of and ability to manage lameness. Regardless of the measurement method lameness in British dairy cattle is high.},

	abstract = {Optimal vaccine dosing is important to ensure the greatest protection and safety. Analysis of dose-response data, from previous studies, may inform future studies to determine the optimal dose. Implementing more quantitative modelling approaches in vaccine dose finding have been recently suggested to accelerate vaccine development. Adenoviral vectored vaccines are in advanced stage of development for a variety of prophylactic and therapeutic indications, however dose-response has not yet been systematically determined. To further inform adenoviral vectored vaccines dose identification, historical dose-response data should be systematically reviewed. A systematic literature review was conducted to collate and describe the available dose-response studies for adenovirus vectored vaccines. Of 2787 papers identified by Medline search strategy, 35 were found to conform to pre-defined criteria. The majority of studies were in mice or humans and studied adenovirus serotype 5. Dose-response data were available for 12 different immunological responses. The majority of papers evaluated three dose levels, only two evaluated more than five dose levels. The most common dosing range was 10(7)-10(10) viral particles in mouse studies and 10(8)-10(11) viral particles in human studies. Data were available on adenovirus vaccine dose-response, primarily on adenovirus serotype 5 backbones and in mice and humans. These data could be used for quantitative adenoviral vectored vaccine dose optimisation analysis.},

	abstract = {Asthma is one of the most common chronic respiratory disease worldwide, with a negative impact on quality of life and socio-economic status of patients. There are some evidences to suggest that Toxocara infection is a neglected risk factor for childhood asthma. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to further understanding of this relationship. Five databases include PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science (ISI), and Google scholar were searched (up to October 2017) to identify the relevant studies. We used random-effects meta-analysis model to estimate the pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity was assessed with the Q-test and I(2) statistic. A total of 17 studies including 11 studies with case-control design (1139 patients and 1023 controls) and six studies with cross-sectional design (a total of 5469 participants, 872 asthmatics, and 4597 non-asthmatics children) met the eligibility criteria. An increased risk for asthma was observed in children with Toxocara infection seropositivity (OR, 1.91; 95\% CI, 1.47-2.47). In sub-group analysis, the pooled ORs were (OR, 2.13; 95\% CI, 1.43-3.15) and (OR, 1.73; 95\% CI, 1.23-2.44) for case-control and cross-sectional studies, respectively. Moreover, considering to specific IgE seropositivity, a pooled OR of 2.36 (95\% CI, 0.93-5.98) was observed. In conclusion, this meta-analysis revealed that children infected with Toxocara spp. are more likely to have asthma compared to non-infected children. More studies (especially longitudinal studies) are needed to further investigate the impact of Toxocara spp. infection on the onset or development of asthma.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12910-021-00580-z},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of great apes (GA) in invasive biomedical research is one of the most debated topics in animal ethics. GA are, thus far, the only animal group that has frequently been banned from invasive research; yet some believe that these bans could inaugurate a broader trend towards greater restrictions on the use of primates and other animals in research. Despite ongoing academic and policy debate on this issue, there is no comprehensive overview of the reasons advanced for or against restricting invasive research with GA. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review of the reasons reported in the academic literature on this topic. METHODS: Seven databases were searched for articles published in English. Two authors screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts of all articles. Two journals specialized in animal ethics, and the reference lists of included articles were subsequently also reviewed. RESULTS: We included 60 articles, most of which were published between 2006 and 2016. Twenty-five articles argued for a total ban of GA research, 21 articles defended partial restrictions, and 14 articles argued against restrictions. Overall, we identified 110 reason types, 74 for, and 36 against, restricting GA research. Reasons were grouped into nine domains: moral standing, science, welfare, public and expert attitudes, retirement and conservation, respect and rights, financial costs, law and legal status, and longer-term consequences. CONCLUSION: Our review generated five main findings. First, there is a trend in the academic debate in favor of restricting GA research that parallels worldwide policy changes in the same direction. Second, in several domains (e.g., moral standing, and respect and rights), the reasons were rather one-sided in favor of restrictions. Third, some prominent domains (e.g., science and welfare) featured considerable engagement between opposing positions. Fourth, there is low diversity and independence among authors, including frequent potential conflicts of interests in articles defending a strong position (i.e., favoring a total ban or arguing against restrictions). Fifth, scholarly discussion was not the norm, as reflected in a high proportion of non-peer-reviewed articles and authors affiliated to non-academic institutions.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oestrosis, caused by the larvae of Oestrus ovis, commonly known as sheep nose bot, is an obligatory cavitary myiasis of sheep and goats. Oestrus ovis is a widespread parasite, but little is known about the prevalence of oestrosis at the global and broad geographical levels. The present study aimed to explore the epidemiology of oestrosis at the global and regional level to estimate prevalences and their associated factors using a systematic approach. This is, to the author's knowledge, the first meta-analysis of oestrosis in sheep and goats. METHODS: Published articles were obtained from nine electronic databases (PubMed, CAB Abstracts, Web of Science, Scopus, UCB library, Medline, Biosis Citation Index, Indian journals and Google Scholar) reporting the prevalence of O. ovis in sheep and goats from 1970 to 2018. Pooled prevalences were estimated using a random effect meta-analysis model. RESULTS: Sixty-six studies were eligible, and data from 40,870 sheep and 18,216 goats were used for quantitative analysis. The random effect estimated prevalence of oestrosis at the global level in sheep was 51.15\% (95\% CI: 42.80-59.51\%) and in goats was 42.19\% (95\% CI: 33.43-50.95\%). The pooled prevalence estimates for Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas were 47.85\% (95\% CI: 36.04-59.66\%), 44.48\% (95\% CI: 33.09-55.87\%), 56.83\% (95\% CI: 48.92-64.74\%) and 34.46\% (95\% CI: 19.90-49.01\%), respectively. Heterogeneity (I(2) {\textgreater} 80\%) was detected in most pooled estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Oestrosis is highly prevalent in many geographical regions of the world, especially in Europe and Africa. Factors that contribute to the pooled prevalence estimate of oestrosis need to be emphasised in any survey to estimate the true prevalence of oestrosis. Furthermore, there is a need for immunisation or implementation of other preventive measures to reduce the burden of oestrosis in sheep and goats and to improve the health and welfare status.},

Despite the substantial economic consequences related to PPR, little is known about the prevalence of this disease at the broad geographical levels. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to use a systematic approach to assess the regional prevalence of PPR in sheep and goats, and the associated factors that contribute to prevalence estimates. METHODS: Published articles on PPR in sheep and goats were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar and the reference lists of articles reporting the prevalence from 1 January 1969 to 31 December 2018. Articles were selected using inclusion and exclusion criteria. Since the heterogeneity among the studies was significant, pooled prevalences were estimated by a random effect meta-analysis model. RESULTS: Data on the prevalence of PPR were obtained from Africa and Asia, where the pooled prevalence estimates were 40.99\% (95\% CI: 37.20\%-44.79\%) and 38.43\% (95\% CI: 35.64\%-41.22\%) respectively. Overall, the estimated pooled prevalence at Africa-Asia level in sheep was 39.31\% (95\% CI: 35.75\%-42.88\%) and in goats was 39.57\% (95\% CI: 36.66\%-42.48\%). Significant heterogeneity (I(2)  {\textgreater} 80\%) was noted in most pooled estimates. CONCLUSION: The results on the regional prevalence estimates of PPR presented here will be useful in raising awareness and advocating for Governments to engage in initiatives to eradicate PPR and prevent it from spreading to other continents.},

Sheep and goats are two of the species of small ruminants most at risk of CCPP. Outbreaks of CCPP cause significant economic and trade disturbances in several parts of the world. However, the extent and magnitude of CCPP in a particular geographical region is still not well known due to lack of comprehensive data on its occurrence. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of CCPP in sheep and goats raised in different geographical regions as well as the factors contributing to the spread of the disease. Searches were done in five online repositories: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CAB Direct and Google Scholar using pre-selected key terms. Data were retrieved from the 41 articles that met the study's inclusion criteria. The pooled prevalences were determined using a random effect meta-analysis model. Prevalence of CCPP was 23.19\% (95\% CI: 11.90-34.47\%) in sheep and 24.91\% (95\% CI: 20.99-28.84\%) in goats. Overall, the regional level pooled prevalence estimates ranged from 8.0\% (95\% CI: 6.91-9.09\%) to 28.70\% (22.02-35.38\%), depending on species and world region. Substantial heterogeneity (I(2)  {\textgreater} 75\%) was observed in most pooled prevalence estimates. The results indicate high prevalences of CCPP in sheep and goats across the regions, particularly in Africa and Asia, and highlights the need to institute appropriate control measures.

Over the last two decades, stem cells have generated great hopes for the treatment of numerous conditions including burns. The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate the role of stem cell therapy as a means to promote burn wound healing. METHODS: Comprehensive searches in major databases were carried out in March 2017 for articles on stem cell therapy in burn wound healing. In total 2103 articles were identified and screened on the basis of pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. RESULTS: Fifteen experimental and two clinical studies were included in the review. The majority of studies reported significant improvement in macroscopic burn wound appearance as well as a trend toward improved microscopic appearance, after stem cell therapy. Other parameters evaluated, such as re-vascularization, collagen formation, level of pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, apoptosis and cellular infiltrates, yielded heterogeneous results across studies. CONCLUSION: Stem cell therapy appears to exert a positive effect in burn wound healing. There is, therefore, justification for continued efforts to evaluate the use of stem cells as an adjunct to first-line therapies in burns.},

The aim of this study is to systematically review and meta-analyze the prevalence of Cryptosporidium in these patients. PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Cochrane and Ovid databases were searched for relevant studies dating from the period of 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2017. Data extraction for the included studies was performed independently by two authors. The overall pooled prevalence was calculated and subgroup analysis was performed on diagnostic methods, geographical distribution and study population. Meta-regression was performed on the year of publication, proportion of patients with diarrhea, and proportion of patients with CD4 {\textless} 200 cells/mL. One hundred and sixty-one studies and 51,123 HIV-positive participants were included. The overall pooled prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection in HIV-positive patients was 11.2\% (CI95\%: 9.4\%-13.0\%). The pooled prevalence was estimated to be 10.0\% (CI95\%: 8.4\%-11.8\%) using staining methods, 13.5\% (CI95\%: 8.9\%-19.8\%) using molecular methods, and 26.3\% (CI95\%: 15.0\%-42.0\%) using antigen detection methods. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium in HIV patients was significantly associated with the country of study. Also, there were statistical differences between the diarrhea, CD4 {\textless} 200 cells/mL, and antiretroviral therapy risk factors with Cryptosporidiosis. Thus, Cryptosporidium is a common infection in HIV-positive patients, and safe water and hand-hygiene should be implemented to prevent cryptosporidiosis occurrence in these patients.},

RESULTS: We identified 276 publications; of these publications, 18 met our inclusion criteria. In animal studies, stem cell therapy was applied more frequently for acute pancreatitis than for chronic pancreatitis. No clinical trials were identified. MSC therapy ameliorated pancreatic inflammation in acute pancreatitis and pancreatic fibrosis in chronic pancreatitis. Bone marrow and umbilical cord MSCs were the most frequently administered cell types. Due to the substantial heterogeneity among the studies regarding the type, source, and dose of MSCs used, conducting a meta-analysis was not feasible to determine the best type of MSCs. CONCLUSION: The available data were insufficient for determining the best type of MSCs for the treatment of acute or chronic pancreatitis; therefore, clinical trials investigating the use of MSCs as therapy for pancreatitis are not warranted.},

	abstract = {We investigated the effect of probiotic supplementation on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) by meta-analysis. We included 30 studies to assess the effect of probiotic administration. We estimated the effect size using standardized mean difference, and we evaluated the statistical heterogeneity of the effect size using Cochran's Q test, followed by meta-ANOVA and meta-regression analysis to explain the heterogeneity of the effect size using a mixed-effects model. We conducted Egger's linear regression test to evaluate publication bias. Among the factors evaluated, colon length and myeloperoxidase showed the greatest Q statistic and I(2) index, respectively. Colon length, transforming growth factor-β, IL-10, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione showed positive effect sizes in the fixed- and random-effects models. The others (spleen weight, tumor necrosis factor α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, IFN-γ, disease activity index, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, nitric oxide, myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde, histological score, and macroscopic inflammatory score) showed negative effect sizes in the fixed- and random-effects models. Probiotics showed a significant effect on all investigated factors, except IL-10. In meta-ANOVA and meta-regression analysis, Lactobacillus paracasei was the most effective probiotic for colon length. Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus fermentum, and a mixture of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Saccharomyces boulardii (LC + SB) were effective for colon length, tumor necrosis factor α, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, and disease activity index. Lactobacillus rhamnosus was most effective for IL-10 and IFN-γ. Dietary probiotics are effective in improving the symptoms of IBD. Although the results of this meta-analysis had some limitations due to a lack of animal experiments, they will be meaningful to people with IBD.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that the amount of protein in the diet affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-testis axis and sub-optimal quantity reduces male fertility potential in both animals and humans. However, individual research reports on the factors associated with male infertility are collectively uncharacterized. AIM: We systematically reviewed, and meta-analysed animal (rats) studies on the effect of low protein diet on factors associated with male infertility. METHODS: PubMed Central, EMBASE and Scopus databases were searched from inception to 30 March 2019 for the study concepts and related keywords in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol. Data on the outcome measures were extracted and pooled across trials using random-effects model and expressed as mean differences (MD) at a 95\% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: Twelve trials identified from 3327 studies, met our inclusion criteria in the comparison of a low protein diet (2-10\% protein) vs control protein diet (17-23\% protein). The results showed that a low protein diet caused a significant reduction in the body weight (P = 0.0001) testis weight (P = 0.0001), seminal vesicle weight (P = 0.0003), epididymis weight P = 0.02), serum testosterone (P = 0.001) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations (P = 0.04) compared with the control treatments. No effect on luteinizing hormone (LH) plasma concentration (P = 0.13) was observed. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that low protein diet caused significant reductions in body weight, testis, epididymis and seminal vesicle weights, serum testosterone and FSH concentration in rats. We infer that sub-optimal protein consumption reduces the gonadal and endocrine function, and consequently male infertility.},

	abstract = {Research indicates that some adult diseases including reproductive pathologies are programmed in utero during foetal development. In particular, maternal low dietary protein, during the most critical developmental periods of male foetal development, may have a detrimental impact on male fertility through direct and epigenetic mechanisms. The aim of our study was to evaluate the impact of a gestational low protein diet on fertility markers in male offspring in rats through a systematic review and meta-analysis. A systematic search using PubMed, and EMBASE databases was performed and two investigators independently screened the 1,703 prospective articles. Eleven articles met the eligibility criteria. Outcome measures were pooled using random-effects models and expressed as mean differences (MDs) at 95\% CIs for each study. The results reveal significant reduction in testis weight (MD (mean difference) -0.08 g; -0.12, -0.42; p = .0001), epididymal sperm count (MD -35.34 × 10(6) cells; -52.15, -18.53; p = .0001), number of Sertoli cells (MD -7.27 × 10(6) (-13.92, -0.62; p = .03), testosterone (T) concentration (MD -0.29 ng/ml; -0.48, -0.09; p = .004) and luteinising hormone (LH) concentration (MD of -0.24 ng/ml; -0.45, 0.04; p = .02) in comparison with controls. In contrast, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentration (MD of 0.07 ng/ml; -0.16, 0.29; p = .56) was not significantly different from controls. We conclude that low gestational dietary protein maternal intake potentially negatively impacts fertility in male progeny later in life. The mechanisms of action responsible for these phenomena remain unclear.},

However, the effects of gestational dietary protein modification on reproductive outcomes at birth are less clear. We, therefore, conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials to determine whether high- or low-protein diets are associated with altered reproductive outcomes in a commonly studied species, the rat. Included studies were identified through a systematic search using electronic databases and manual literature review to identify randomized studies published between June 1972 and March 2019. Thirty-two studies were identified and used to analyze the effects of low- and high-protein gestational diets on litter size, litter weight, gestational weight gain, and gestational feed intake. The results indicate that low-protein diets significantly reduced litter weight (P {\textless} 0.00001) and gestational weight gain (P {\textless} 0.0006), but did not influence litter size (P = 0.62) or gestational feed intake (P = 0.25). In contrast, high-protein diets were found to reduce gestational feed intake (P = 0.004) but did not influence litter size (P = 0.56), litter weight (P = 0.22), or gestational weight gain (P = 0.35).

METHODS: A literature search was conducted on PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, and Google databases in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, using keywords to identify articles related to parietal complications of HD in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. The following keywords were used: HD, hydatid cyst, cystic echinococcosis, alveolar echinococcosis, abdominal HD, thoracic HD, parietal complication, cutaneous fistulization, cystocutaneous fistulization, cutaneous involvement, external rupture, external fistulization, subcutaneous involvement, and subcutaneous abscess. The language of publication, journal, or country was not included as limitation criteria, and publications dated before August 1, 2016, were considered. Articles or abstracts containing adequate information, such as age, sex, cyst size, cyst location, clinical presentation, fistula opening location, and management were included in the study, whereas articles with insufficient clinical and demographic data were excluded. RESULTS: The literature review included 52 articles involving 55 patients with parietal complications of HD. Thirty-two articles were written in English, 15 in French, 2 in Spanish, 1 in Italian, 1 in German and 1 in Russian. All 55 patients (women, 30; men, 23; unknown, 2) involved in the study were aged 7 to 93 (mean ± standard deviation, 54.5 ± 20.2) years. A total of 24 patients had cysto-cutaneous fistula (Echinococcus granulosus), 12 had subcutaneous rupture, 10 had cutaneous fistula (E multilocularis), 3 had cystosubcutaneous abscess, 3 had cysto-cutaneo-bronchial fistula, 2 had cysto-cutaneo-bronchio-biliary fistula, and 1 had cutaneo-bronchial fistula. E granulosus were detected in 43 and E multilocularis in 12 patients through clinical, radiological, or histopathological examinations. CONCLUSION: Parietal complications such as cysto-cutaneous fistulization are a rare complication of HD. Complicated HD should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with cutaneous involvement, especially in HD endemic regions.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.wasman.2019.03.054},
	abstract = {The animal production industry in the United States is currently undergoing a phase of growth; however, such growth brings certain challenges. One of the most prominent concerns in this regard is the increasing amounts of animal waste produced as a natural consequence of stock population growth. For decades, composting, including that of manure and animal mortalities, has been utilized to manage animal waste. Recently, in an effort to enhance the composting process, biochar has been proposed for use as a compost amendment, and over the last few years, an increasing number of papers on composting with biochar have been published. However, although there have been a few review papers that have summarized the literature regarding biochar use in composting, none of these has focused on animal waste composting. Accordingly, the purpose of this review is to critically analyze the role of biochar in livestock and poultry waste composting, identify gaps in our current knowledge, and propose future research directions. On the basis of the studies analyzed, biochar has the potential to improve animal waste composting processes at application rates of 5-10\%. Biochar can extend the thermophilic phase of the composting process, lower the pH of compost material, prevent leachate formation, and reduce ammonia, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions. Given that the feedstock used to produce biochar and the pyrolysis conditions employed in its production affect the performance of biochar, it is important to report the physicochemical properties of the biochars used to enable comparison of the results of different studies. Moreover, there is a need for further research to gain a better understanding of the impact of biochar regarding the elimination of antibiotic-resistant genes and animal mortality composting.},

We quantified the overall regional and country-specific Salmonella prevalence in different human populations and identified the most common serotypes. Published literature of Salmonella prevalence was systematically reviewed and reported following the Preferred Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Pooled Salmonella prevalence measures were estimated using a random-effects model. We identified 46 research reports that reported 84 Salmonella prevalence measures in 15 out of 24 countries in MENA. There were 252,831 tested humans with 6,356 Salmonella-positive cases. The pooled Salmonella prevalence in MENA was estimated at 6.6\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 5.4\%-7.9\%). The highest pooled Salmonella prevalence measures were in Morocco (17.9\%, 95\% CI: 5.7\%-34.8\%, 1997-2012), Tunisia (10.2\%, 95\% CI: 4.3\%-18.0\%, 1988-2009) and Sudan (9.2\%, 95\% CI: 6.5\%-12.2\%, 2006-2008), while the lowest were in Jordan (1.1\%, 95\% CI: 0.1\%-3.0\%, 1993-2010), Oman (1.2\%, 95\% CI: 1.2\%-1.3\%, 1998-2002) and Palestine (1.2\%, 95\% CI: 0.4\%-2.1\%, 1999-2011). In MENA, Salmonella pooled prevalence in gastrointestinal symptomatic, gastrointestinal asymptomatic and food handlers population groups was 13.0\% (95\% CI: 7.6\%-19.6\%), 11.4\% (95\% CI: 2.2\%-25.7\%) and 3.8\% (95\% CI: 1.0\%-8.0\%), respectively.

Salmonella Enteritidis (29.8\%) and Typhimurium (23.6\%) were the most common serotypes. Salmonella was a common foodborne pathogen in MENA countries, particularly in North African countries. Findings inform the scientific community, the public and the decision-makers with Salmonella prevalence and gaps in evidence in MENA to support control and prevention strategies and could leverage more research studies.},

Previous work by our group examined the association of snakebite and acute myocardial infarction. In this systematic review we aim to assess the clinical characteristics and outcomes of acute cerebrovascular accidents that are reported to be extremely rare complications of snake envenomation. METHODS: We performed a literature search for reports on stroke associated with snake envenomation between Jan 1995 to Oct 2018, and summarized their characteristics. RESULTS: Eighty-three published cases were reviewed. 66.3\% of the cases were younger than 50 years of age. The mean time for the onset of the symptoms is 23.8±10.9 hours after exposure. 77.1\% of the cases found to have ischemic stroke, 20.5\% with intra-cranial hemorrhage and both infarction and hemorrhage in 2.4\%. Mortality was reported in 16.9\% with mean time between onset of the symptoms and death is 4.2 days. CONCLUSION: Stroke secondary to snake envenomation is a rare but serious complication. Once stroke is suspected, initiating appropriate management is crucial in reducing morbidity and mortality associated with this potentially fatal complication of snake envenomation.},

The search of the literature yielded 67 studies that fit the primary screening criteria. Included studies were assessed for bias and confounding using a predefined risk assessment tool adapted from the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials and GRADE guidelines. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager and R. Random sequence generation was low in more than 59 \% of studies. Risk of allocation concealment and performance bias were largely unclear in over 68 \% of studies. Calves fed probiotics had increased average daily live weight gains (ADG) from birth to weaning (mean difference [MD] = 83.14 g/d 95 \% CI = 58.36-107.91, P {\textless} 0.001) compared with calves on a control diet. Calf age reduced the level of heterogeneity of the effect of probiotics on ADG for calves between one to three weeks of age (τ(2) = 73.15; I(2) = 4\%; P = 0.40) but not for calves older than three weeks of age (τ(2) = 2892.91; I(2) = 73 \%; P {\textless} 0.001). Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was lower for calves on probiotics (MD = -0.13 kg of dry matter intake (DMI) to kg of live weight (LW) gain, 95 \% CI = -0.17 to -0.09, P {\textless} 0.001), and the heterogeneity of effect was large in younger aged calves (τ(2) = 0.05; I(2) = 78 \%; P = 0.03). The risk of bias regarding the methodology in the included studies was high. The quality of evidence for each outcome was categorised as moderate. There is sufficient data to support the effectiveness of probiotic use in some applications such as for the improvement of performance and productivity parameters of calves. However, the evidence is weak for other potential probiotic uses in calves such as improved health and reduced risk of disease. Therefore, the existing data are inconclusive and do not support the use of probiotics as an alternative to antimicrobials to improve calf health and productivity.},

Literature was collated via retrieved information from online databases, viz, PubMed, MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Besides improved immunomodulation and nutrient digestibility, in-feed probiotics have shown drastic reductions in gastrointestinal tract-invading pathogens. However, every novel probiotic strain cannot be assumed to share historical safety with conventional strains. Any strain not belonging to the wild-type distributions of relevant antimicrobials, or found to be harbouring virulence determinants, should not be developed further. Modes of identification and the transmigration potential of the strains across the gastrointestinal barrier must be scrutinized. Other potential risk factors include the possibility of promoting deleterious metabolic effects, excessive immune stimulation and genetic stability of the strains over time. Adverse effects of probiotics could be strain specific, depending on the prevailing immunological and physiological condition of the host. The most crucial concern is the stability of the strain. Probiotics stand a good chance of replacing antibiotics in animal husbandry. The possibility of the probiotics used in animal feed cross-contaminating the human food chain cannot be downplayed. Thus, the established safety measures in probiotic development must be adhered to for a successful global campaign on food safety and security.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The study aimed to evaluate the effect of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) as adjunctive therapy to scaling and root planing in experimental periodontitis in rats, with or without systemic involvement, by means of histometric analysis of the furcation region. METHODS: Systematic search was done using PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE and ProQuest databases. Quantitative analysis of alveolar bone loss, with subcategories for the experimental periods studied, was performed. The analysis was performed through the mean difference (MD), with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) and according to SYRCLE guidelines. RESULTS: Nine studies were considered eligible. A statistically favorable difference was observed for the use of aPDT in all periods studied in systemically healthy animals at 7 (P {\textless} 0.00001; MD: -0.71; 95\% CI: [-0.85, -0.58]; I2: 90\%), 15 (P {\textless} 0.00001; MD: -0.49; 95\% CI: [-0.62, -0.37]; I2: 88\%), and 30 (P {\textless} 0.00001; MD: -0.53; 95\% CI: [-0.65, -0.41]; I2: 80\%) days postoperatively.

In this review, 108 studies from 2013 to 2018 were considered to determine the quality of adherence to the ARRIVE guidelines in the reports of the methodologies. The majority of the studies lacked the details recommended in the ARRIVE guidelines regarding data directly related to the welfare of animals undergoing surgery and those about anesthetic protocols and analgesics.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis and intestinal parasites are mostly affecting poor people. They are in a vicious since one is the risk factor for the other. However, the comprehensive report on the burden and co-incidence of intestinal parasites and tuberculosis in Ethiopia is scant. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to provide abridge conclusive evidence on the intestinal parasite-tuberculosis co-infection in Ethiopia. METHODS: A total of 414 articles published in English were searched from both electronic databases (CINAHL, DOAJ, Embase, Emcare, Medline, ProQuest, and PubMed, Science Direct, and Web of Science) and other sources. The qualities of the included studies were assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools and the publication bias was measured using the funnel plot and Eggers regression test. Comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) Version 3.3.07 and Review Manager software were used to estimate pooled prevalence and associations of intestinal parasites and tuberculosis infection. RESULTS: Eleven articles with a total of 3158 tuberculosis patients included in the analysis based on the eligibility criteria. The estimated pooled prevalence of intestinal parasites co-infection was 33\% (95\% CI: 23.3, 44.3) using the random-effects model. The most common intestinal parasites were Ascaris lumbricoides 10.5\% (95\% CI: 6.0, 17.5), Hookworm 9.5\% (95\% CI: 6.10, 14.4), Giardia lamblia 5.7\% (95\% CI: 2.90, 10.9) and Strongyloides sterocoralis 5.6\% (95\% CI: 3.3, 9.5). The odds of intestinal parasites infection was higher among tuberculosis patients compared to tuberculosis free individuals (OR = 1.76; 95\% CI: 1.17, 2.63). A significant difference was observed among TB patients for infection with intestinal helminths (OR = 2.01; 95\% CI: 1.07, 3.80) but not for intestinal protozoans when compared with their counterparts. The odds of multiple parasitic infections was higher among tuberculosis patients (OR = 2.59, 95\% CI: 1.90, 3.55) compared to tuberculosis free individuals. However, intestinal parasites co-infection was not associated with HIV status among tuberculosis patients (OR = 0.97; 95\% CI: 0.71, 1.32). CONCLUSION: One-third of tuberculosis patients are co-infected with one or more intestinal parasites, and they are more likely to be infected with intestinal helminths and multiple intestinal parasitic infections compared to TB free individuals. We recommend routine screening of tuberculosis patients for intestinal parasites. The effect of mass deworming on tuberculosis incidence would be important to be considered in future researches.

	abstract = {Cancer is an increasingly frequent malignancy worldwide, and despite the advances in drug development, it is still necessary to develop new plant-derived medicines. Euterpe oleracea (acai) is abundant in South and Central America and has health benefits due to its high levels of phytochemicals, including lignans and polyphenols. The aim of this review was to systematically describe the safety and antitumor effects of acai in preclinical models using rodents to provide a more comprehensive assessment of acai for both therapeutic uses and the development of future clinical studies in cancer. Eligible studies were identified using four international databases (PubMed, Medline, Lilacs and SciELO) from their inception date through December 2017. The included studies were analyzed with methodological rigor (QATRS) to enable better quality control for these experimental studies. Sixty publications were identified in the databases, but only 9 articles were eligible: 6 evaluated the pharmacological effects of acai in animal models of cancer (1 model each of esophageal cancer, urothelial cancer, melanoma and Walker-256 tumor and 2 models of colon cancer), and 3 were toxicological assays using preclinical models with rodents. Overall, 747 animals were analyzed. On a QATRS score scale of 0-20, the quality of the studies ranged from 16 to 20 points. Pulp was the main fraction of acai administered, and an oral administration route was most common. The acai dosage administered by gavage ranged from 30 mg/kg to 40,000 mg/kg, and acai fed in the diet accounted for 2.5\% to 5\% of the diet. The anticarcinogenic and chemopreventive activities of acai were observed in all experimental models of cancer and reduced the incidence, tumor cell proliferation, multiplicity and size of the tumors due to the antiinflammatory, antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties of acai. No genotoxic effects were observed after acai administration. The results of this review suggest that acai is safe and can be used as a chemoprotective agent against cancer development. Acai therapy may be a novel strategy for treating cancer.},

The data were obtained from studies published between January 2000 and December 2015, and were evaluated by variance analysis. Lactating dairy cow diets with a single source of roughage other than corn silage resulted in lower voluntary intake, milk yield, and differences in milk composition, compared to diets based on corn silage or the combination of two roughages, probably due to reduced nutrient digestibility. Diets based on corn silage are distinguished by feed efficiency, milk yield, and composition. Diets based on the combination of two roughage sources are similar with respect to milk yield and composition, compared to diets based on corn silage; whereas, diets with a single source of roughage (other than corn silage), even when containing a higher proportion of concentrate, led to reduced voluntary intake, milk yield, and food efficiency due to the lower utilization of the nutrients. Diets based on corn silage in general allow a higher proportion of roughage in the diet due to energy density.},

Using a meta-analysis, we evaluated the effects of dietary roughage sources on the composition, voluntary intake, and digestibility of diets fed to crossbred Holstein x Zebu cows under experimental feeding conditions in Brazil. Finally, we assessed the effects of dietary roughage sources on milk yield and composition. The database was composed of 43 experiments with 183 treatments, including 943 lactating cows. The data were obtained from studies published between January 2000 and December 2015. The data were evaluated by analysis of variance, considering the distribution of variables. The diets differed in dry matter and crude protein (CP) contents according to the roughage sources. Diets based on corn silage demonstrated higher intakes of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), CP, and total digestible nutrients, which improved the digestibility of NDF and CP, and resulted in a higher milk yield compared to the diets with one roughage source or those with a combination of two roughage sources. The present study demonstrated that feeding crossbred Holstein x Zebu lactating cows alternative roughage sources compromised milk production and that lactating cows produced higher milk yields when fed corn silage.},

	abstract = {It is well-known that positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) can prevent ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and improve pulmonary physiology in animals with injured lungs. It's uncertain whether PEEP has similar effects in animals with uninjured lungs. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different PEEP levels in animals with uninjured lungs was performed. Trials in animals with injured lungs were excluded, as were trials that compared ventilation strategies that also differed with respect to other ventilation settings, e.g., tidal volume size. The search identified ten eligible trials in 284 animals, including rodents and small as well as large mammals. Duration of ventilation was highly variable, from 1 to 6 hours and tidal volume size varied from 7 to 60 mL/kg. PEEP ranged from 3 to 20 cmH(2)O, and from 0 to 5 cmH(2)O, in the 'high PEEP' or 'PEEP' arms, and in the 'low PEEP' or 'no PEEP' arms, respectively. Definitions used for lung injury were quite diverse, as were other outcome measures. The effects of PEEP, at any level, on lung injury was not straightforward, with some trials showing less injury with 'high PEEP' or 'PEEP' and other trials showing no benefit. In most trials, 'high PEEP' or 'PEEP' was associated with improved respiratory system compliance, and better oxygen parameters. However, 'high PEEP' or 'PEEP' was also associated with occurrence of hypotension, a reduction in cardiac output, or development of hyperlactatemia. There were no differences in mortality. The number of trials comparing 'high PEEP' or 'PEEP' with 'low PEEP' or 'no PEEP' in animals with uninjured lungs is limited, and results are difficult to compare. Based on findings of this systematic review it's uncertain whether PEEP, at any level, truly prevents lung injury, while most trials suggest potential harmful effects on the systemic circulation.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.aanat.2019.04.003},
	abstract = {PURPOSE: To provide a systematic review of the literature on the disorders and management of the lacrimal drainage system (LDS) in few of the species of the animal kingdom. METHODS: The authors performed a PubMed search of all articles that were published in English with specific reference to lacrimal drainage disorders in animals. Data captured include demographics, presentations, investigation, diagnoses and management modalities. Emphasis was also on anatomical differences, evolutionary perspectives and addressing the lacunae and potential directions for future research. RESULTS: The lacrimal drainage system is a terrestrial adaptation in vertebrates. Evolutionary development of the LDS is closely linked to the Harderian gland and the vomeronasal organ. Variable differences in the clinical presentations and management of lacrimal drainage disorders (LDD) are noted in comparison to humans. These are secondary to unique structural and pathophysiological differences. Uniformity in usage and reporting of disease terminologies is required. Diagnostic challenges in clinical examination can be met with the development of customized lacrimal instruments. Contrast dacryocystorhinography is a very useful investigation in the diagnosis of LDD. Multiple bypass procedures like conjunctivorhinostomy, conjunctivobuccostomy and conjunctivomaxillosinosotomy have been described for nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO). Advances of endoscopy and radiological techniques are paralleled by minimally invasive lacrimal interventions. The search for an ideal animal model for human LDS is far from over and the choice of the animal needs to be customized based on the research objectives. CONCLUSION: The lacrimal drainage system is an ancestral feature in tetrapod vertebrates and it is present, in some form or another, in most descendant species. The lacrimal drainage system has evolved considerably, adapting to the needs of the species. It is essential to understand the lacrimal drainage disorders of domestic animals so that the animal and human lacrimal sciences contribute more meaningfully to each other.},

Synthetic anthelmintics are most commonly used to control CE, however, prolonged use of these drugs may result in many adverse effects. This study aims to discuss the in vitro/in vivo scolicidal efficacy of different medicinal plants and their components used against Echinococcus granulosus. Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, PubMed and Scopus were used to retrieve the published literature from 2000-2020. A total of 62 published articles met the eligibility criteria and were reviewed. A total of 52 plant species belonging to 22 families have been reported to be evaluated as scolicidal agents against E. granulosus worldwide. Most extensively used medicinal plants against E. granulosus belong to the family Lamiaceae (25.0\%) followed by Apiaceae (11.3\%). Among various plant parts, leaves (36.0\%) were most commonly used. Essential oils of Zataria multiflora and Ferula asafetida at a concentration of 0.02, and 0.06 mg/ml showed 100\% in vitro scolicidal activity after 10 min post application, respectively. Z. multiflora also depicted high in vivo efficacy by decreasing weight and size while also causing extensive damage to the germinal layer of the cysts. Plant-based compounds like berberine, thymol, and thymoquinone have shown high efficacy against E. granulosus. These plant species and compounds could be potentially used for the development of an effective drug against E. granulosus, if further investigated for in vivo efficacy, toxicity, and mechanism of drug action in future research.},

	abstract = {Addition of uric acid (UA) to thrombolytic therapy, although safe, showed limited efficacy in improving patients' stroke outcome, despite alleged neuroprotective effects of UA in preclinical research. This systematic review assessed the effects of UA on brain structural and functional outcomes in animal models of ischemic stroke. We searched Medline, Embase and Web of Science to identify 16 and 14 eligible rodent studies for qualitative and quantitative synthesis, respectively. Range of evidence met 10 of a possible 13 STAIR criteria. Median (Q1, Q3) quality score was 7.5 (6, 10) on the CAMARADES 15-item checklist. For each outcome, we used standardised mean difference (SMD) as effect size and random-effects modelling. Meta-analysis showed that UA significantly reduced infarct size (SMD: -1.18; 95\% CI [-1.47, -0.88]; p {\textless} 0.001), blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment/oedema (SMD: -0.72; 95\% CI [-0.97, -0.48]; p {\textless} 0.001) and neurofunctional deficit (SMD: -0.98; 95\% CI [-1.32, -0.63]; p {\textless} 0.001). Overall, there was low to moderate between-study heterogeneity and sizeable publication bias. In conclusion, published rodent data suggest that UA improves outcome following ischemic stroke by reducing infarct size, improving BBB integrity and ameliorating neurofunctional condition. Specific recommendations are given for further high-quality preclinical research required to better inform clinical research.},

The purpose of this systematic review is to synthesize and evaluate the current literature on adult-perpetrated animal abuse and to identify the etiological factors related to this type of offending. Twenty-three studies met the specific inclusion criteria but most importantly, they examined the characteristics of adult perpetrators of animal abuse. The findings from this review were demarcated by sample type: (1) Participants were the perpetrators of the animal abuse or held offense-supportive attitudes and (2) participants were victims of intimate partner violence reporting incidents of animal abuse perpetrated by their partner. From the perpetrator perspective, there were key developmental (i.e., maladaptive parenting strategies), behavioral (such as varied offending behaviors), and psychological (e.g., callousness, empathy deficits) factors highlighted in the literature. Finally, in the context of intimate partner violence, findings indicated that perpetrators abuse animals to control, coerce, intimidate, and/or manipulate their victims (this effect is moderated by the victims' emotional attachment to their pet). This review inherently underlines treatment targets that could achieve greater clinical gains, but we also conclude that more empirical and theoretical work is needed in order to set an agenda that prioritizes future research and effective practice.},

	abstract = {Cholesterol is a lipophilic component essential for the body due to its diverse functionalities, such as participation in vitamin D synthesis, metabolism of steroids and sex hormones, help in the absorption of fat soluble vitamins, besides participating in the maintenance of the fluidity and permeability of plasma membrane. This function is extremely important to regularize the action potential and the consequent synaptic plasticity. However, high cholesterol levels due to a hyperlipidemic diet or genetic dysfunction are related to various cardiovascular and metabolic pathologies, such as diabetes. In addition, elevated cholesterol levels participate in the pathophysiology of neuropathies, such as Alzheimer and Parkinson. Considering that some neuropathies have hippocampal alterations as one of the events, this study aimed to investigate the possible relationship between hypercholesterolemia, hippocampus and the pathophysiology of neurological disorders through a review of the literature using preclinical studies. During the month of February 2018, we searched the databases Pubmed and Lilacs, using "hypercholesterolemia" and "hippocampus". Inclusion criteria: Preclinical studies published between 2013 and 2017 were selected. Exclusion criteria: review articles, articles that did not correlate hypercholesterolemia with neurological disorders and hippocampus. Increased serum cholesterol was associated with biochemical changes, especially oxidative stress, inflammation and metabolism of the amyloid protein, as well as neurodegenerative processes at the hippocampus level. In addition, drugs that modulate serum cholesterol levels have also been found to influence cognition and hippocampal integrity. Preclinical studies indicate that the hippocampus was susceptible to hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, hypercholesterolemia may contribute to neurological disorders with hippocampal disorders.},

METHODS: A systematic review of literature of cases of congenital brucellosis was performed on October 10, 2017 (registered as PROSPERO CRD42017072061). RESULTS: A case seen by the authors was added to the review, yielding 44 reported cases of which 22 (50\%) were from Turkey, Saudi Arabia, or Kuwait. For cases with the gestational age reported, 23 of 37 (62\%) were preterm. The species was Brucella melitensis in 35 cases, Brucella abortus in 3 cases and not documented in 6 cases. The diagnosis was based on a positive blood culture from the first day of life in 20 cases (45\%). Presentation was usually typical for a bacteremic infant of that GA, but two infants were asymptomatic at diagnosis. There were two recurrences and seven deaths (six in preterm infants), but the role of Brucella infection in the deaths was not clear. CONCLUSION: Brucellosis remains a concern in endemic countries, adversely affecting pregnancy and very rarely causing neonatal infection. Prematurity appeared to be the prime cause of death in neonates with congenital brucellosis.},

	abstract = {Aliskiren is an oral antihypertensive medication that acts by directly inhibiting renin. High levels of circulating renin and prorenin activate the pathological signaling pathway of fibrosis. This drug also reduces oxidative stress. Thus, the aim of this systematic review is to analyze experimental studies that show the actions of aliskiren on fibrosis. PubMed and LILACS databases were consulted using the keywords aliskiren and fibrosis within the period between 2005 and 2017. Fifty-three articles were analyzed. In the heart, aliskiren attenuated remodeling, hypertrophy, inflammatory cytokines, collagen deposition, and oxidative stress. In the kidneys, there was a reduction in interstitial fibrosis, the infiltration of inflammatory cells, apoptosis, proteinuria, and in the recruitment of macrophages. In diabetic models, an improvement in the albumin/creatinine relationship and in the insulin pathway in skeletal muscles was observed; aliskiren was beneficial to pancreatic function and glucose tolerance. In the liver, aliskiren reduced fibrosis, steatosis, inflammatory cytokines, and collagen deposition. In the lung and peritoneal tissues, there was a reduction in fibrosis. Many studies have reported on the beneficial effects of aliskiren on endothelial function and arterial rigidity. A reduction in fibrosis in different organs is cited by many authors, which complies with the results found in this review. However, studies diverge on the use of the drug in diabetic patients. Aliskiren has antifibrotic potential in several experimental models, interfering with the levels of fibrogenic cytokines and oxidative stress. Therefore, its use in diseases in which fibrosis plays an important pathophysiological role is suggested.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The presence of infections is one of the main factors that leads to delays in healing or non-closure of cutaneous wounds. Although the goal of antibiotic use is to treat or prevent infection, there is currently no agreement on the effectiveness of these products. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of antibiotic use during the healing process of skin wounds in animal models not intentionally infected, as well as to analyze the advances and limitations of the studies carried out in this field. MAIN METHODS: This systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines, using a structured search on the MedLine (PubMed) and Scopus platforms to retrieve studies published until August 29, 2018, 13:35p.m. The studies included were limited to those that used excision or incision wound models and that were not intentionally infected. The data for the animal models, antibiotic used, and the main results of the studies were extracted, and compared where possible. Bias analysis and methodological quality assessments were examined through the SYRCLE's Risk of Bias tool. KEY FINDINGS: Twenty-seven studies were selected. Overall, the effects of the antibiotic on the wound decreased inflammatory cell infiltration and promoted an increased number of fibroblasts, extracellular matrix constituents, re-epithelialization and tissue strength. A great deal of important information about the methodology was not presented, such as: the statistical analysis used, the animal model (sex and age), antibiotic dosage, blinding and randomization of the animals chosen. SIGNIFICANCE: Based on the results found, we believe that antibiotic therapy can be considered a viable alternative for the treatment of cutaneous wounds. However, current evidence obtained from the methodological quality analysis points towards a high risk of bias. This is due to the incomplete characterization of the experimental design and treatment protocol, which compromises the reproducibility of the studies.},

	abstract = {Dairy product consumption has been related to type 2 diabetes (T2D) incidence, although data from epidemiological studies have shown mixed results regarding the association of dairy products and T2D risk. This overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses aimed to examine the scientific literature available on the association between dairy product consumption and T2D risk. A literature search was conducted in the MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, Cochrane Central Database of Systematic Reviews, and Web of Science databases from their inception to April, 2018. Forest plots summarized the risk ratios (RRs) reported by meta-analyses on high compared with low and dose-response dairy product consumption. The risk of bias was assessed using the AMSTAR2 tool. We included 12 meta-analyses, reporting data from 4-22 cohort studies and from 4-23 populations. The participants' ages ranged from 20 to 88 y, and participants were followed up for from 4 to 30 y. Studies included 64,227-566,875 participants and reported 4810-44,474 cases of T2D. Most studies reported an inverse association between T2D incidence and dairy product consumption, especially for 1) total dairy products (range: 0.86-0.91), 2) low-fat dairy products (range: 0.81-0.83), 3) low-fat milk (RR: 0.82), and 4) yogurt (range: 0.74-0.86). Dose-response analyses showed a decreased T2D risk for 1) 200-400 g/d of total dairy products (range: 0.93-0.97) and 2) 200 g/d of low-fat dairy products (range: 0.88-0.91). Total dairy product consumption is associated with a lower risk of T2D, especially for yogurt and low-fat dairy consumption. The association with cheese is moderate. Moreover, dose-response analyses showed that the risk of T2D decreased by each unit increase in consumption of total dairy products and low-fat dairy products.},

Most of the related literature focuses on MS impact on offspring, however, it should ideally also consider the impact of altered maternal behaviour caused by MS itself. This systematic review aimed at providing a comprehensive compilation of the effects of MS on key maternal behaviour aspects. We performed a keyword literature search using Boolean operators. Databases were searched between 2000-2018. Additional studies were included from manual search. Twenty-nine articles addressing the impact of MS on maternal behaviour and/or mothers' anxiety, depression-like behaviour, memory and consequences on underlying mechanisms. The methodological aspects and main conclusions were extracted from each study. This review shows that MS induces changes in dams. Results are particularly robust for increased anxiety and depressive-like symptoms, and altered maternal behaviours, predominantly for longer periods of MS. Finally, research in the field could strongly benefit from the establishment of guidelines to reduce the methodological inconsistencies here identified.},

Due to the need of more efficient healing drugs, animal peptides are emerging as new molecular platforms to accelerate skin wound closure and to prevent and control bacterial infection. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the preclinical evidence on the impact of animal peptides on skin wound healing. In addition, we carried out a critical analysis of the studies' methodological quality. Main Methods. This systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines, using a structured search on the PubMed-Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science platforms to retrieve studies published until August 25, 2020 at 3 : 00 pm. The studies included were limited to those that used animal models, investigated the effect of animal peptides with no association with other compounds on wound healing, and that were published in English. Bias analysis and methodological quality assessments were examined through the SYRCLE's RoB tool. RESULTS: Thirty studies were identified using the PRISMA workflow. In general, animal peptides were effective in accelerating skin wound healing, especially by increasing cellular proliferation, neoangiogenesis, colagenogenesis, and reepithelialization. Considering standardized methodological quality indicators, we identified a marked heterogeneity in research protocols and a high risk of bias associated with limited characterization of the experimental designs. CONCLUSION: Animal peptides show a remarkable healing potential with biotechnological relevance for regenerative medicine. However, rigorous experimental approaches are still required to clearly delimit the mechanisms underlying the healing effects and the risk-benefit ratio attributed to peptide-based treatments.},

From the PRISMA methodology, an initial search process was carried out on the OVIDR, SciELO Citation IndexR and RedalycRsearch platforms. Based on a research question, a search for relevant titles was carried out, considering only original articles and case reports published in indexed journals and under peer review processes. Subsequently, the reference lists of the definitive articles were searched for additional information (snowballing). Four articles were considered for the presentation of final results and discussion, all published in English, between 2002 and 2015. From the information collected from the four studies, it can be inferred that there are immunological variations in patients undergoing general anesthesia, finding differences in immune responses between total intravenous and inhaled anesthesia. Additionally, it is noteworthy the absence of experimental research that allows not only to analyze the differences between the types of anesthesia, but also between the different anesthetic protocols and patients with concomitant diseases.},

Recently, several animals' models' studies have been performed to investigate the therapeutic impact of irisin in several disorders. Several interventional trials used different doses. However, optimum dose was not determined. This systematic review aims to identify the optimal dose of interventional irisin in mice and rat animal models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Online databases PubMed, Google Scholar, and Springer were systematically searched from 2012 to 2019. The words searched were irisin, irisin and animal model, physical activity, and irisin and irisin dosage. Non-irisin doses, in vitro studies, and factors influencing irisin levels were excluded. RESULTS: Eleven of the total 391 qualifying studies were included. A daily injection of 500 μg/kg irisin may be the optimum dose of effect in mice and rats. CONCLUSION: More studies are required to determine the optimum dose of irisin to be used as a therapeutic intervention based on animal model.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Sri Lanka is endemic to cutaneous leishmaniasis and reported as the latest focus of leishmaniasis in the Asian subcontinent. Annually, the number of leishmaniasis cases is increasing; therefore, more efficient diagnostic tools, treatment methods and effective prevention measures are indispensable. For this reason, many studies were conducted regarding leishmaniasis infections in Sri Lanka; however, some areas need more attention. Thus, in this review, we comprehensively discussed the studies on leishmaniasis carried out in Sri Lanka. METHODS: Published articles on leishmaniasis in Sri Lanka were searched on PubMed, Google Scholar and ResearchGate databases. Inclusion criteria for the articles were based on keyword searches including 'Leishmaniasis in Sri Lanka', 'Leishmaniasis vector in Sri Lanka', 'Sandfly species in Sri Lanka', 'Leishmaniasis epidemiology in Sri Lanka' which are publicly accessible as of 15th July 2019. RESULTS: In this study, we evaluated and summarized the leishmaniasis reports in Sri Lanka and mainly focused on clinical presentation of leishmaniasis infection, genetic characteristics of Leishmania donovani Sri Lankan strain, geographical distribution and associated environmental factors, immunological aspects of the infection, vector, reservoir host, risk factors, diagnosis and treatment, and prevention and control. Furthermore, we identified the areas where further research is needed to fill the essential knowledge gaps. CONCLUSIONS: Leishmaniasis has become a critically important parasitic infection in Sri Lanka, whereas the significant clinical form is cutaneous leishmaniasis. Prevalence of the leishmaniasis infections is reported from all the districts of the country. Therefore, more studies are essential to be carried out to fill the existing knowledge gaps emphasized in this review.},

Consequently, back pain management is commonly limited to symptomatic treatment therapies. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review is to evaluate major progress and to unravel the biology and pathology of ID discogenic pain. METHODS: The design of this study is a systematic review. A literature search was conducted using Medline, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases, with no time constraints to locate relevant literature. Significant articles (literature reviews, therapeutic essays, clinical-human-research studies, animal research, and laboratory research) on the intervertebral disc were identified and reviewed. The exclusion criteria were the following: case reports and clinical studies with {\textless}10 patients. RESULTS: Through a dense review of the literature, the ID is deciphered and described as a fragile anatomic entity. For this systematic review, 132 studies were identified and 79 were retained. The main deterioration and alteration mechanisms that lead to the programmed death of the ID are summarized. In addition, the large variety of biological therapies that override surgical treatment are determined. CONCLUSIONS: The degeneration mechanisms of the ID are well defined and decrypted. Although therapies have progressed, none has been effective. The regeneration of the ID remains highly challenging because of the complexity of its natural composition, microstructure, and mechanical properties.},

Using Cochrane Neonatal and SYRCLE methodologies we included random or quasi-random studies that allocated non-human mammals to macronutrient supplements or no supplements between birth and weaning and assessed post-weaning outcomes. We used random-effects models to calculate standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Six studies provided low to very-low-quality evidence that macronutrient supplementation increased weight in juvenile rats (SMD; 95\% CI: 2.13; 1.00, 3.25; 1 study, n = 24), increased leptin concentrations in older adults (1.31; 0.12, 2.51; 1 study, n = 14 male rats), but decreased leptin concentrations in young adults (-1.13; -2.21, -0.05; 1 study, n = 16 female rats) and improved spatial learning and memory (qualitative data; 1 study). There was no evidence of sex-specific effects and no overall effect on length, serum lipids, body composition, HOMA-IR, or blood pressure. Macronutrient supplements may affect later growth, metabolism, and neurodevelopment of preterm and SGA animals, but evidence is limited and low quality.},

	abstract = {The World Health Organization has reported an annual global suicide rate of 14.5 per 100,000 people. On the other hand, it is estimated that approximately one-third of the global population are infected with Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) parasite. It is widely assumed that microbial pathogens, such as T. gondii, are probably associated with affective and behavioural modulation. The present article aimed to assess the proposed role of toxoplasmosis in raising the risk of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA) using the available epidemiological data. Seven major electronic databases and the Internet search engine Google were searched for all the studies published between the 1st of January 1950 and 31st of October 2019. The heterogeneity and the risk of bias within and across studies were assessed. Following data extraction, pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% confidence interval (CI) across studies were calculated using the random-effects models. A total number of 9,696 articles were screened and 27 studies were regarded as eligible in our systematic review (SI with five papers and 22 papers on SA). A significant association was detected between antibodies against T. gondii with TA (ORs = 1.57; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-2.00, p = .000). Exploration of the association between T. gondii and SA yielded a positive effect of seropositivity for IgG antibodies but not IgM. Despite the limited number of studies, a statistical association was detected between suicidal behaviours and infection with latent T. gondii.},

	abstract = {Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is well known for its ability to virtually infect all warm-blooded vertebrates. Although felines as the definitive hosts have an important role in the epidemiology of toxoplasmosis, there are few descriptions of genetic diversity in the world. The present review study aimed to describe the population structure of T. gondii in these animal species. For the purpose of the study, five English language databases reporting data on T. gondii genotyping in cats were searched within March-June 2019. This study is registered on the site of CAMARADES-NC3Rs (15-Jan-2018). The searching process resulted in the inclusion of 50 reports published from 1992 to June 2019. The data revealed that 47,390 samples were genotyped into 662 T. gondii DNA/isolates. Globally, atypical genotypes were predominant (47.7\%, n = 316); in addition, Type II clonal strains were the second most common genotype (37\%, n = 244). These results suggested an epidemic population structure in America and Asia, and a clonal population structure in Europe and Africa. Genotype \#3 was found to be dominant in Africa, Europe and Oceania continents. Furthermore, genotypes \#9 and \#5 were prevalent in Asia and America, respectively. Additionally, genotypes \#2, \#3, \#5 and \#20 were common genotypes in domestic and sylvatic cycles from family Felidae. Collectively, this systematic review indicated a large degree of genetic diversity and circulation of mouse-virulent T. gondii strains in this family. However, further studies are necessary to better understand the population structure of T. gondii in these animal species and determine the significance of their features.},

	abstract = {Osteoarthritis is a common clinical and pathological end-point from a range of joint disorders, that ultimately lead to structural and functional decline of the joint with associated lameness and pain. Increasing understanding of the risk factors associated with osteoarthritis will assist in addressing the significant threat it poses to the welfare of the dog population and implementing preventive measures. Presented here, is the first comprehensive systematic review and evaluation of the literature reporting risk factors for canine osteoarthritis. This paper aimed to systematically collate, review and critically evaluate the published literature on risk factors for canine osteoarthritis and its predisposing conditions such as developmental joint dysplasias, cruciate ligament degeneration, and patellar luxation. Peer-reviewed publications were systematically searched for both osteoarthritis and predisposing arthropathies on Web of Science and PubMed following PRISMA (2009) guidelines, using pre-specified combinations of keywords. Sixty-two papers met the inclusion criteria and were evaluated and graded on reporting quality. Identified risk factors included both modifiable factors (neuter status and body weight) for which intervention can potentially affect the risk of occurrence of osteoarthritis, and unmodifiable factors (sex, breed, and age) which can be used to identify individuals most "at risk." Osteoarthritis in dogs frequently develops from predisposing arthropathies, and therefore risk factors for these are also important to consider. Papers evaluated in this study were rated as medium to high-quality; gap analysis of the literature suggests there would be significant benefit from additional research into the interactions between and relative weighting of risk factors. There are a number of examples where research outcomes are conflicting such as age and sex; and further investigation into these factors would be beneficial to attain greater understanding of the nature of these risks. Comprehensively collating the published risk factors for osteoarthritis and its predisposing conditions offers opportunities to identify possible means for control and reduction within the population through preventative methods and control strategies. These factors are highlighted here, as well as current literature gaps where further research is warranted, to aid future research direction.},

Periodontal disease (PD) is associated to other systemic diseases, and inflammation may be responsible for the association. Consequently, controlling inflammation not only may benefit oral health but also may assist with the management of other chronic inflammatory conditions. We aimed to investigate the effects of resveratrol administration on PD control in preclinical studies. A systematic search was performed for scientific articles using both electronic databases and a manual search using combinations of the following search terms: "resveratrol" OR "3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene" AND "periodontal disease" OR "periodontitis" OR "gingivitis". Only in vivo original studies investigating resveratrol treatment on experimental animal models of PD were selected. A quality assessment of the studies was performed using the Animal Research Reporting In Vivo Experiment (ARRIVE) guidelines, and the risk of bias was assessed using the Syrcle tool. The search returned 570 articles, and 11 matched the inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis showed that resveratrol treatment attenuated alveolar bone loss (T$^{\textrm{2}}$=0.0041; 95\% CI: -0.14; -0.04). The ARRIVE criteria reported a good quality of studies in general (mean score 28.5+or-2.5). However, five Syrcle domains indicated a high risk of bias or did not present information clearly.

	abstract = {Mathematical modelling is nowadays a pivotal tool for infectious diseases studies, completing regular biological investigations. The rapid growth of computer technology allowed for development of computational tools to address biological issues that could not be unravelled in the past. The global understanding of viral disease dynamics requires to account for all interactions at all levels, from within-host to between-herd, to have all the keys for development of control measures. A literature review was performed to disentangle modelling frameworks according to their major objectives and methodologies. One hundred and seventeen articles published between 1994 and 2020 were found to meet our inclusion criteria, which were defined to target papers representative of studies dealing with models of viral infection dynamics in pigs. A first descriptive analysis, using bibliometric indexes, permitted to identify keywords strongly related to the study scopes. Modelling studies were focused on particular infectious agents, with a shared objective: to better understand the viral dynamics for appropriate control measure adaptation. In a second step, selected papers were analysed to disentangle the modelling structures according to the objectives of the studies. The system representation was highly dependent on the nature of the pathogens. Enzootic viruses, such as swine influenza or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome, were generally investigated at the herd scale to analyse the impact of husbandry practices and prophylactic measures on infection dynamics. Epizootic agents (classical swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease or African swine fever viruses) were mostly studied using spatio-temporal simulation tools, to investigate the efficiency of surveillance and control protocols, which are predetermined for regulated diseases. A huge effort was made on model parameterization through the development of specific studies and methodologies insuring the robustness of parameter values to feed simulation tools. Integrative modelling frameworks, from within-host to spatio-temporal models, is clearly on the way. This would allow to capture the complexity of individual biological variabilities and to assess their consequences on the whole system at the population level. This would offer the opportunity to test and evaluate in silico the efficiency of possible control measures targeting specific epidemiological units, from hosts to herds, either individually or through their contact networks. Such decision support tools represent a strength for stakeholders to help mitigating infectious diseases dynamics and limiting economic consequences.},

	abstract = {Background: Due to their antimicrobial properties and safety, essential oils are currently proposed as a sustainable option for antibiotic alternatives in the livestock sector. This current systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the effects of dietary essential oil supplements on dry matter intake (DMI), average daily gain (ADG), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of small ruminants. Methods: A total of 12 studies (338 small ruminants) were included in this meta-analysis. The overall effect size was quantified using Hedges' g with 95\% confidence interval (CI) using a fixed-effect model. Publication bias was inspected using Begg's and Egger's tests, followed by trim and fill method to detect the number of potential missing studies. Results: Insignificant heterogeneity among studies was detected both on DMI ( P of Q = 0.810; I-square = 0.00\%), ADG ( P of Q = 0.286; I-square = 17.61\%), and FCR ( P of Q = 0.650; I-square = 0.00\%). The overall effect size showed that essential oils supplementation had no significant impact on DMI (Hedges' g = -0.12; 95\% CI = -0.50 to 0.26; P = 0.429) and FCR (Hedges' g = -0.17; 95\% CI = -0.55 to 0.22; P = 0.284), but had a significant positive impact on ADG (Hedges' g = 0.44; 95\% CI = 0.12 to 0.76; P = 0.002). The result of publication bias analysis showed that DMI, ADG, and FCR did not present any significant biases ( P {\textgreater} 0.10), and no potential missing studies detected. Conclusions: Dietary essential oil could improve ADG of small ruminants, without any alteration on DMI and FCR. Further research in this topic is still required to provide stronger evidence of the potency of essential oil as a growth promoter for small ruminants.},

	abstract = {Rabies is one of the most feared infectious diseases worldwide, predominantly occurring in Asia and Africa where rabies is endemic in domestic dog populations. Whereas previous studies have demonstrated mass dog vaccination and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) as the most effective control strategies, successful rabies elimination has yet to be realized as these recognized effective interventions continue to face challenges of limited accessibility. In the light of new evidence towards improving programmatic feasibility and clinical practice in rabies control especially among endemic countries, a systematic review was undertaken to identify cost-effectiveness modelling studies of rabies preventive measures and to provide a critical review of published evidence through comparative evaluation and model quality assessment, and a synthesis of key findings based thereon. Our search through MEDLINE and SCOPUS identified a total of 17 studies which mostly focused on estimating the impact of increasing PEP and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) access, human rabies elimination scenarios using mass dog vaccinations only or complemented with PEP strategy. While no significant methodological inconsistency across studies was identified and the extent of reporting is generally high, we note several points for quality and internal validity improvement. Assessment of modelling approach showed that decision tree models had similar pathways. The results of the studies suggest that interventions would be cost-effective at the cost-effectiveness threshold of 1 to 3 times per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as recommended by the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health's GDP based thresholds, compared with no intervention in rabies endemic countries. When compared across studies which reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) as cost per QALY gained or DALY averted in international dollars adjusted by purchasing power parity conversion rate, PEP vaccination yields less cost per DALY averted or QALY gained due to one year-horizon assessment compared to canine vaccination at 4- or 10-year-time horizon.},

	abstract = {Neospora caninum is an apicomplexan parasite with worldwide distribution, which primarily causes disease in dogs and cattle. It has been recognized as an important cause of epidemic and endemic abortion in cattle around the world. There is no study to demonstrate the country level picture of the disease in Iran and estimate the extent of the problem, quantitatively. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to systematically review the observational studies on bovine neosporosis in Iran and estimate an overall serologic prevalence of the infection in the cattle population. Search for all published reports on N. caninum in Iran was conducted from inception until September 2018. Major English (PubMed, Scopus and Science Direct) and Persian (IranDoc, SID, Iranmedex, and Magiran) electronic database sources were used for this study. After removing duplicated articles, 128 documents remained. Unrelated articles (89) were excluded after primary screening and 39 articles were evaluated for eligibility. Finally, 37 studies from 33 articles were recognized as eligible and were included in the present work. The author screened the studies and extracted the data twice, carefully. Based on the meta-analysis, the overall serologic prevalence of N. caninum in 10,967 cattle with 2619 positive ones was 23.6 \% with 95 \% CI: 19.8-27.9 \%. The random effect model was used for meta-analysis because the Cochran Q value (795.10, df = 36, P {\textless} 0.001) and Higgins index (I(2) = 95.47 \%) showed statistically significant heterogeneity. In subgroup meta-analysis, abortion status of the animal and geographical location of the study showed significant association with serologic prevalence, while age and breed did not have significant associations. No publication bias was detected, and sensitivity analysis showed stability of the overall estimate after excluding any individual study. It could be concluded that N. caninum is widespread in cattle population in Iran and the time is right to implement national level educational and control programs for it.},

While an upper limit of alpha-lipoic acid intake in humans has not been conclusively determined, the levels for oral intake of a-LA have been better defined in animals, and distinct differences based on species have been described. The maximum tolerated oral dose of a-LA in dogs has been reported as 126 mg/kg body weight and the LD(50) as 400 to 500 mg/kg body weight. The antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuro-protective benefits of alpha-lipoic acid in dogs were observed at concentrations much lower than the maximum tolerated dose or proposed LD(50). At concentrations of 2.7-4.94 mg/kg body weight/day, alpha-lipoic acid is well tolerated and posed no health risks to dogs while providing improved antioxidant capacity. This review thereby supports the utility of alpha-lipoic acid as an effective nutritive additive in dog food.},

	abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance is a major public health concern, and food systems are a crucial point in the epidemiology of these resistances. Among antimicrobials, critically important ones are therapeutic drugs that should be primarily safeguarded to allow successful outcomes against important bacterial infections in humans. The most important source of antimicrobial resistance has been recognized in the inappropriate use of antimicrobials in human and animal medicine, with farming being a critical stage. Products of animal origin are the link between animal and humans and can contribute to the spread of antimicrobial resistance, in particular through bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae, commonly present in both animals' gut and food. Salmonella is an important member of this bacterial family due to its pathogenicity, its noteworthy prevalence and the frequent detection of resistance genes in different isolates. In the present systematic review, the distribution of antimicrobial resistance determinants among Salmonella enterica serovars in pigs, cattle and poultry production was investigated in the European context. A comprehensive literature search was carried out in three different databases, and 7955 papers were identified as relevant. After the different steps of the review process, 31 papers were considered eligible for data extraction to gain insight about sources and reservoirs for such genes. Results suggest that despite the increasing attention directed toward antimicrobial resistance in animal production, a wide plethora of genes still exist and further actions should be undertaken to face this challenge.},

Four English language databases (ISI Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed and Science Direct) containing data on D. immitis prevalence in dogs were thoroughly searched resulting in the inclusion of 193 studies. The findings revealed that the pooled and weighted prevalence of D. immitis infection in dog population based on published papers throughout the world was 10.91\% (95\% CI=10.18-11.65). In addition, subgroup analysis based on meta-regression revealed that a significant difference between the pooled and weighted prevalence of D. immitis in dogs and country (β =0.14, P=0.049).

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the prevalence rate and status of Sarcocystis spp. in ruminants as important food sources in Iran. METHODS: Data were collected from papers indexed in five English language electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar) and four Persian electronic databases (IranMedex, SID, IranDoc, and Magiran) from January to April 2019. Papers were selected based on inclusion criteria. Data analysis was performed in StatsDirect statistical software, version 2.7.2. RESULTS: The searching process resulted in the identification of 73 studies. Data analyses revealed that the total prevalence (95\% confidence intervals) of Sarcocystis spp. in Iranian ruminants was 74.40\% (64.01-83.56). In addition, a significant association was also observed between sarcocystosis infection in Iranian ruminants and year, host, location, and diagnostic technique (P {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: According to our data, the prevalence of Sarcocystis infection in ruminants is relatively high. High pathogenicity of some Sarcocystis spp. and the negative impact that the spread of some parasites among ruminants can have on human and animal health necessitate the direction of more attention toward monitoring, controlling, and preventing sarcocystosis.},

The current review was conducted to investigate the genotypic status and prevalence of hydatid disease in camels across the world. For the purpose of the study, the articles addressing the worldwide prevalence of hydatidosis in camels were searched in several English language databases. The search process resulted in the inclusion of 122 papers. Based on the data presented in the reviewed articles, the pooled prevalence of hydatid disease in camels across the world was measured at 23.75\% (95\% CI 20.15-27.55). Moreover, the subgroup analysis demonstrated significant differences in the overall prevalence of hydatidosis among camels based on year, geographic area, climate parameters, camel population, gender, infected organ, fertility rate of the cyst and laboratory diagnostic technique. Furthermore, the Echinococcus granulosus genotypes identified in camels with hydatidosis included G1, G2, G3, G1-G3, G5, G6, G7, G6-G7 and G6-G10, with G6 being the most common genotype throughout the world. The data obtained from the current study are central to the better conceptualization of the biological and epidemiological characteristics of E. granulosus s.l. genotypes around the world, which can be helpful in the planning and adoption of more comprehensive control strategies.},

During the last decades, many studies have characterized the protective antigens of Echinococcus granulosus and their role in immunization of various animal host species. Herein, we aimed to systematically evaluate and represent the best antigens as possible vaccine candidates for cystic echinococcosis. Data were systematically searched from five databases including ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect and Web of Science, up to 1 February 2020. Two reviewers independently screened and assessed data extraction and quality assessment. A total of 47 articles were eligible for inclusion criteria in the current study. The most common antigens used for vaccination against E. granulosus were EG95 and antigen B. Freund's adjuvant and Quil A have been predominantly utilized. In addition, regarding the antigen delivery, animal models, measurement of immune responses and reduction in hydatid cyst have been discussed in the text. The data demonstrated that DNA vaccines with antigen B and recombinant protein vaccines based on EG95 antigen have the best results and elicited protective immune responses.},

Recurrent disease is attributed to tumor adaptation to survive, despite lower circulating androgen concentrations, making the blockage of downstream androgen signaling a chemotherapeutic goal for PCa. Dietary intake of tomato and its predominant carotenoid, lycopene, reduce the risk for PCa, and preclinical studies have shown promising results that tomato and lycopene can inhibit androgen signaling in normal prostate tissue. The goal of this systematic review was to evaluate whether mechanistic evidence exists to support the hypothesis that tomato or lycopene interact with the androgen axis in PCa. Eighteen studies (n = 5 in vivo; n = 13 in vitro) were included in the final review. A formal meta-analysis was not feasible due to variability of the data; however, the overall estimated directions of effect for the compared studies were visually represented by albatross plots. All studies demonstrated either null or, more commonly, inhibitory effects of tomato or lycopene treatment on androgen-related outcomes. Strong mechanistic evidence was unable to be ascertained, but tomato and lycopene treatment appears to down-regulate androgen metabolism and signaling in PCa.},

We herein report a general improvement in technical standards throughout the temporal span examined; however, significant methodological limitations are also identified. We propose easily actionable avenues for ameliorating these shortcomings and enhancing the reach of this field. Text mining and pathway analysis corroborate the relevance of proteins and metabolites related to the triad oxidative stress-inflammation-disease on reproductive function. We envisage a breakthrough in cattle reproductive molecular research within the next few years as in vivo sample techniques are improved, omics analysis equipment becomes more affordable and widespread, and software tools for single- and multi-omics data processing are further developed.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Anaesthetic neuroprotection in the setting of traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains unproved and is based upon the results in preclinical experiments. Here, we sought to synthesise the results in rodent models of TBI, and to evaluate the effects of publication bias, experimental manipulation, and poor study quality on the effect estimates. METHODS: After a systematic review, we used pairwise meta-analysis to estimate the effect of anaesthetics, opioids, and sedative-hypnotics on neurological outcome, and network meta-analysis to compare their relative efficacy. We sought evidence of bias related to selective publication, experimental manipulation, and study quality. RESULTS: Sixteen studies, involving 32 comparisons, were included (546 animals). The treatment improved the neurological outcomes by 35\%; 95\% confidence interval: 26-44\%; P{\textless}0.001. The statistical heterogeneity was small (12\%), but the 95\% prediction interval for the estimate was wide (15-56\%). The statistical power was low: 61\% (90\% confidence interval: 22-86\%). The small sample size in the studies was a serious shortcoming reducing the statistical heterogeneity and obscuring differences in outcome between drugs and between experimental conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Anaesthetics do provide neuroprotection in rodent models of TBI. The effect-size estimates do not appear to be exaggerated by selective publication, experimental manipulation, or study design. The main shortcoming of the included studies were small sample sizes leading to low power and imprecision, which precluded the network meta-analysis from providing a meaningful ranking for efficacy amongst the drugs. Reliable preclinical investigations of neuroprotection by anaesthetics will require larger sample sizes.},

Compared to tsetse-transmitted animal trypanosomoses, little attention is given to the epidemiology and control of surra. Understanding its epidemiology is a first step in local and global efforts to control the disease. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies on distribution, host ranges and prevalence of T. evansi infection. METHODS: Four electronic databases were searched for publications on T. evansi that met our inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Subsets of publications were subjected to meta-analysis for the pooled prevalence of T. evansi in various hosts as determined by multiple detection methods. RESULTS: A total of 272 references published between 1906-2017 were included. Trypanosoma evansi was reported from 48 countries; largely confined to Africa and Asia with publications on natural T. evansi infections from 77\% (n = 48) of countries, contrasting with seven countries in South America, and four in Europe where T. evansi is not endemic but was imported with infected animals. Although surra is a notifiable disease, many countries do not report surra cases to OIE. Trypanosoma evansi was mainly reported from dromedary camels in Africa and the Middle East, water buffaloes, cattle, dogs and horses in East and Southeast Asia. In South America, the acute form of the disease was reported in horses and dogs. Surra was also reported in a wide range of wild animals. Some rare human cases occurred in India and Vietnam. Meta-analysis on a subset of 165 publications indicated pooled prevalence of T. evansi in domestic animals ranging from 14-31\%, 6-28\% and 2-9\% using respectively antibody detection, molecular and parasitological tests, with camels as the most affected, followed by buffalo and cattle. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates that T. evansi affects a wide range of domestic and wild animals in Africa, Asia and South America with highest prevalence observed in dromedary camels. For successful control of T. evansi, both locally and globally, the role of wild animals in the epidemiology of surra needs further investigation.},

	abstract = {AIMS: To better understand the genesis and consequences of urinary bladder hypertrophy in animal models of diabetes. This part of a three-article series will analyze urinary bladder hypertrophy in the diabetes mellitus type 1 model of rats injected with streptozotocin (STZ). METHODS: A systematic search for the key word combination "diabetes," "bladder" and "hypertrophy" was performed in PubMed; additional references were identified from reference lists of those publications. All papers were systematically extracted for relevant information. RESULTS: A total of 39 studies were identified that quantitatively reported on bladder hypertrophy in rats upon injection of STZ; of which several reported on multiple time points yielding a total of 83 group comparisons. Bladder hypertrophy was found consistently, being fully developed as early as 1 week after STZ injection (bladder weight 188 ± 59\% of matched control). Hypertrophy was similar across sexes and STZ doses (35-40 vs 50-65 mg/kg) but appeared greater with Wistar rats than other rat strains. The extent of bladder hypertrophy was not correlated to blood glucose concentrations, but normalization of blood glucose concentration by insulin treatment starting early after STZ injection prevented hypertrophy; insulin treatment starting after hypertrophy had established largely reversed it. CONCLUSIONS: Bladder size approximately doubles after STZ injection in rats; the extent of hypertrophy is not linked to the severity of hyperglycemia but largely reversible by restoration of euglycemia.},

The most frequently identified constraint in Ethiopia and Tanzania was disease (n = 28 and n = 3, respectively), and in Uganda, it was the lack of access to veterinary services (n = 4). Additionally, access to good breeding stock, lack of animal records, and an established marketing chain were also mentioned in all the three countries. Ectoparasites, gastrointestinal parasites, orf, and sheep/goat pox were the most frequently mentioned disease challenges causing productivity losses. Many articles provided potential solutions as suggested by farmers, including improved access to veterinary services and medicines, improved record keeping, and access to good breeding stock. Farmers highlighted the value of community-based participatory development plans to increase education on disease control, land management, and husbandry. This review also highlighted knowledge gaps, the need for further research, particularly in Tanzania and Uganda, and the importance of addressing multiple challenges holistically due to the links between constraints.},

The goal of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate the effect of conventional targeted temperature management (TTM) between 32-36 °C in animal cardiac arrest models, and to estimate the influence of effect modifiers on the pooled effect of TTM. DATA SOURCES: We searched Medline and Scopus from inception to May 2020 for randomised controlled animal trials assessing the effect of conventional TTM versus normothermia on neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest. We extracted data on study characteristics, study quality data, neurologic outcome, mortality, and potential effect modifiers. RESULTS: We retrieved 1635 studies, 45 studies comprising data of 981 animals met the inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was high in 17 studies and moderate in 28 studies. We undertook random-effects meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses to calculate the pooled effect and the influence of effect modifiers. There was a strong beneficial effect of TTM as compared to normothermia on neurologic outcome (standardised mean difference of 1.4 [95\% CI -1.7 to -1.1; I(2) = 75\%]). Faster cooling rates, lower target temperature of TTM within the range of 32-36 °C, and shorter duration of cooling were independently associated with an increasing effect size of TTM. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review of animal cardiac arrest studies showed a consistent favourable effect of postresuscitation TTM as compared to normothermia on neurologic outcome that increased with lower target temperatures.},

The objectives of this review were to summarize the available literature on swine depopulation methods and to highlight critical gaps in knowledge. Peer-reviewed articles were identified through a systematic search in electronic databases including Web of Science, MEDLINE, and PubMed. A total of 68 publications were assessed. Gaseous carbon dioxide inhalation was the most commonly reported depopulation method for both small- and large-scale trials. Measurements of consciousness state, which serves to assess suffering and humaneness, appeared to be lacking in a high proportion of the studies. None of the published studies demonstrated an ideally reliable and safe way to induce rapid unconsciousness in large groups of pigs. Development of rapid mass depopulation methods applicable to large groups of pigs is necessary to provide industry partners with suitable and low-cost emergency preparedness procedures while adhering to personnel safety and animal welfare standards.

	abstract = {The objectives were to use meta-analytic methods to determine the effects of amount of supplemental choline ion as rumen-protected choline (RPC) starting prepartum on production and health of dairy cows. The literature was systematically reviewed and 21 experiments, with up to 66 treatment means and 1,313 prepartum parous cows, were included. All experiments had a treatment with no supplemental choline (0 g/d; n = 30 treatment means), and the amount of choline ion supplemented to treated cows ranged from 5.6 to 25.2 g/d (n = 36 treatment means). Duration of pre- and postpartum feeding of RPC averaged (±standard deviation) 22.0 ± 6.0 and 57.5 ± 42.2 d, respectively. Data collected included the ingredient composition and chemical analyses of pre- and postpartum diets, amount of choline ion supplemented, number of cows per treatment, frequency of health events, and the least squares means and respective standard error of the means for production responses, liver composition, and blood parameters. The concentrations of net energy for lactation and metabolizable amino acids and protein (MP) in pre- and postpartum diets were predicted for each treatment mean using National Research Council (2001). Mixed model meta-analysis was conducted including the random effect of experiment and weighting by the inverse of the standard error of the means squared. Increasing supplementation of choline ion during transition linearly increased pre- (β = 0.0184 ± 0.00425) and postpartum dry matter intake (β = 0.0378 ± 0.00974), and yields of milk (β = 0.436 ± 0.112), energy-corrected milk (ECM; β = 0.422 ± 0.0992), fat (β = 0.00555 ± 0.000793), and protein (β = 0.0138 ± 0.00378). Nevertheless, an interaction between choline and postpartum metabolizable methionine as a percent of MP (METMPPo) was observed for yields of milk, ECM, and protein because as METMPPo increased, the positive response to choline on yields of milk, ECM, and protein decreased. Supplementing choline during transition tended to reduce the risks of retained placenta and mastitis, but it had no effect on metritis, milk fever, displaced abomasum and ketosis, or the concentration of triacylglycerol in the hepatic tissue postpartum. The median amount of choline ion supplemented was 12.9 g/d and responses in postpartum dry matter intake and yields of milk, ECM, fat, and protein to that amount of supplementation were 0.5, 1.6, 1.7, 0.07, and 0.05 kg/d, respectively. No interactions were observed between supplemental choline and prepartum dietary net energy for lactation or metabolizable methionine as a percent of MP. Collectively, feeding RPC during the transition period improves performance in parous cows. Increases in yields of milk and milk components were observed in spite of pre- and postpartum diets, although the increments in milk, ECM, and protein yields with supplementing choline decreased as the concentration of methionine in postpartum diets increased. The optimum dose of choline ion was not detected, but likely it is more than the 12.9 g/d fed in most experiments evaluated in the current meta-analysis. Finally, the meta-analysis identified lack of sufficient data to understand the role of supplemental choline in nulliparous cows.},

The severity of zoonotic diseases is compounded by factors such as poverty, living in close contact with livestock and wildlife, immunosuppression as well as coinfection with other diseases. The interconnections between humans, animals and the environment are essential to understand the spread and subsequent containment of zoonoses. We searched three scientific databases for articles relevant to the epidemiology of bacterial zoonoses/zoonotic bacterial pathogens, including disease prevalence and control measures in humans and multiple animal species, in various African countries within the period from 2008 to 2018. The review identified 1966 articles, of which 58 studies in 29 countries met the quality criteria for data extraction. The prevalence of brucellosis, leptospirosis, Q fever ranged from 0-40\%, 1.1-24\% and 0.9-28.2\%, respectively, depending on geographical location and even higher in suspected outbreak cases. Risk factors for human zoonotic infection included exposure to livestock and animal slaughters. Dietary factors linked with seropositivity were found to include consumption of raw milk and locally fermented milk products. It was found that zoonoses such as leptospirosis, brucellosis, Q fever and rickettsiosis among others are frequently under/misdiagnosed in febrile patients seeking treatment at healthcare centres, leading to overdiagnoses of more familiar febrile conditions such as malaria and typhoid fever. The interactions at the human-animal interface contribute substantially to zoonotic infections. Seroprevalence of the various zoonoses varies by geographic location and species. There is a need to build laboratory capacity and effective surveillance processes for timely and effective detection and control of zoonoses in Africa. A multifaceted 'One Health' approach to tackle zoonoses is critical in the fight against zoonotic diseases. The impacts of zoonoses include.},

However, evidence-based knowledge on FLI has remained unavailable. The main objectives of this study were to investigate the status of felines infected by Leishmania spp. worldwide. Data were extracted from 10 available databases over the period of 1982 to 2017. Overall, 78 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were used for data extraction in this systematic review. The overall FLI prevalence by both serological and molecular methods was estimated at 10\% (95\% CI: 8\%-14\%). In Italy, both the seroprevalence (24 \%) and PCR prevalence (21 \%) were found to be higher than in other countries. The most common diagnostic test used was the indirect fluorescent antibody test (38.5\%). Studies on mixed-breed felines were more common than those on other breeds, while the most common parasite species was L. infantum (63\%). Our findings suggest that cats act as primary and/or secondary reservoir hosts in the transmission of the Leishmania spp. to humans and also to dogs, by sandflies, at least in endemic foci. Moreover, available data confirm the enzootic stability situation of FLI in several countries including some in Europe.},

	abstract = {In Ethiopia, poultry production is an important source of domestic food and nutrition security while providing income for nearly 80\% of Ethiopians. However, several infectious and parasitic diseases hamper poultry production. To date, evidence on the nationwide burden of specific diseases has not been collated to inform targeting of poultry health interventions. The objective of this systematic review is to summarize and analyze the literature on poultry diseases since 2000. A detailed systematic review protocol was designed according to Cochrane collaboration, Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE), and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements. The review revealed that 14 infectious and parasitic diseases of poultry were reported in 110 published studies from 2000 to 2017, and 81.82\% (90/110) of the studies covered 6 diseases: Newcastle disease (ND), infectious bursal disease (IBD), avian coccidiosis, helminth infestation, ecto-parasite infestation, and Salmonella infection. The pooled prevalence estimates of ND and IBD were 44\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 27 to 63) and 41\% (95\% CI: 23 to 60), respectively. Among the parasitic diseases, avian coccidiosis, helminth infestation, and ecto-parasite infestation had estimated pooled prevalences of 37\% (95\% CI: 30 to 44), 62\% (95\% CI: 45 to 78), and 50\% (95\% CI: 33 to 68), respectively. The pooled prevalence estimate of Salmonella infection was found to be 51\% (95\% CI: 32 to 70). Most of the studies were conducted in central Ethiopia, in the State of Oromia, and focused on extensive farming systems. While the number of studies was low, the overall trend of disease reporting in the literature is increasing (Y = 0.99X-3.34). In conclusion, the high-pooled prevalence estimates of diseases and the scarcity of reported data for all of Ethiopia indicate an important data gap on infectious-disease distribution in the country. While the high-pooled prevalence points towards the need for intervention to control poultry diseases, there is also a need to ensure all diseases that result in production losses and public health risks are studied appropriately in all Ethiopian production systems.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: The present systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed to assess the weighted molecular prevalence of Blastocystis sp. in humans along with the comparative molecular prevalence and subtypes distribution of Blastocystis isolated from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in Iran. METHODS: International electronic databases including Medline/PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, Embase, and Google Scholar were explored until 4th October 2020. Heterogeneity index was evaluated among studies using Cochran's Q test and I(2) index. Finally, 23 eligible studies were qualified to be included in this review. RESULTS: The pooled molecular prevalence of Blastocystis sp. in Iran was reported 15.2\% (95\% CI 11.5-19.7). In addition, the molecular prevalence based on PCR-sequencing and STS primers was reported 12.5\% (95\% CI 8.6-17.7) and 19.8\% (95\% CI 13.1-28.8), respectively. Interestingly, there was a considerably higher prevalence among asymptomatic patients [25.1\% (95\% CI 20.8-30.0)] in comparison to symptomatic ones [21.0\% (95\% CI 15.9-27.2)]. In addition, the frequency of Blastocystis ST1, ST2, and ST3 from positive samples in symptomatic patients was 19.7\%, 35.1\%, and 47.4\%, respectively. In addition, the prevalence of Blastocystis ST1, ST2, and ST3 from positive samples in asymptomatic patients was 27.1\%, 26.8\%, and 37.8\%, respectively. The results obtained in Iran showed that Blastocystis is more common in asymptomatic patients compared to patients having clinical symptoms. Of note, ST3, as the most common subtype causing clinical symptoms, was the most prevalent reported subtype among both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in the country. CONCLUSIONS: Hence, the pathogenicity of the Blastocystis parasite is not subtype-specific and appears to be related to a variety of risk factors. Still the Blastocystis epidemiology is open to question and more large-scale studies should be performed on this aspect.},

	abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease of livestock with serious economic and public health impact in Ethiopia. The disease is reported from cattle, small ruminants and dromedary camels in the country. However, there is no organized summary report on the magnitude and distribution pattern of TB in small ruminants and dromedary camels, unlike that of bovine TB. Consequent to this gap, this review was organized to provide pooled prevalence estimates, and examine level of heterogeneity among studies at national level. In addition, it attempts to illustrate the spatial distribution patterns along the three livestock species based on available reports. Tuberculosis articles on the aforesaid livestock species were searched online using PubMed, CAB direct, Web of Science and AJOL databases. Eighteen articles published from January 2000 to May 15, 2020, written in the English language that fulfill the selection quality criteria were considered for the review. Altogether, 50 district based observational studies conducted on 10,371 goats, 6262 dromedary camels, and 1457 sheep were used for analysis. Accordingly, the pooled prevalence estimates of TB, in a random effect model were 2.3 \% (95 \% CI: 1.7, 3.1) for goats, 0.8 \% (95 \% CI: 0.5, 1.4) for sheep and 8.2 \% (95 \% CI: 6.6, 10.2) for dromedary camels. The subgroup analysis revealed presence of statistically significant differences (p {\textless} 0.001) in pooled prevalence estimates among the three species. In multivariable meta-regression model, diagnostic methods used for screening (single intra-dermal comparative cervical tuberculin test (SICCTT){\textgreater} 2mm, SICCTT {\textgreater} 4mm and detailed postmortem inspection) were the only predictors identified to show statistically significant difference (p{\textless}0.001) and explained 68.6 \% of the explainable heterogeneity (R(2) =0.686) in goat TB studies. In general, study reports on small ruminant and dromedary camel TB are limited throughout the country. The most significant data gaps were in Gambella, and Benshangul-Gumuz regional states, where no single report could be retrieved on small ruminant TB. Limitation of study reports and lack of comparable categories constrained further investigation on other predictors in sheep and camel studies. Thus, the authors would like to emphasize the need for more representative studies in the species of concern in all regions of the country. Meanwhile, the relatively higher proportion of TB in dromedary camels demands special attention in arid and semiarid parts of the country, as it is the leading livestock species on which agropastoralist and pastoralists livelihoods depend.},

	abstract = {Lungworms are important parasitic nematodes of small ruminants that colonize the lower respiratory tract and cause high morbidity and economic loss throughout the world. This systematic review was conducted with the aim of estimating the pooled prevalence of lungworm infection in small ruminants in Ethiopia. Besides, it examines the predictors thought to be responsible for heterogeneity noted between the reports. The search databases used were PubMed, CAB direct, AJOL and Web of science. Eligible studies were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Thirty two studies published between 2000 and 2016 were found eligible and data were generated on 14,257 small ruminants (12,310 sheep and 1947 goats). Predictors including the study area, type of small ruminants affected, parasitic species involved, a diagnostic test used, study design, management systems, breed, agroecology, and year article published were used as milestone of data extraction. The statistical tool employed were meta-analysis, univariable and multivariable meta-regression and Egger's and begg's statistics for sensitivity analysis. Accordingly, the estimated pooled prevalence of lung worm infection in small ruminants was 40.8\% (95\% CI: 36.1, 45.6) with a very high heterogeneity between the study reports (I(2) = 96.5\%). However, diagnostic test used and administrative States were the only two predictors identified to explain 15.5\% of the explainable heterogeneity (R(2) = 0.1545, tau(2) unexplained = 0.6032, tau(2) total = 0.7135) noted between studies. The reviewed studies showed that three genera of lungworms, namely Dictyocaulus filaria, Mullerius capillaris and Protostrogylus rufescens were prevalent both in sheep and goats in Ethiopia. Mixed infection with two or three species was reported in 4.4 to 48.6\% of the total infected animals. Indeed this review is informative and provides a better picture on lungworm infection in Ethiopia; however, it is not exhaustively detailed as there was lack of clear data on the role of some important factors like age, flock size, management system and seasonal variation on lungworm infection. Thus, thorough epidemiological studies including all seasons are required for formulation of meaning full control strategies.},

	abstract = {Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by obligate intracellular protozoa of the genus Leishmania. Ethiopia does not have an overall estimation of prevalence of leishmaniasis infection at a country level. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize and pool estimates of studies that report the prevalence of leishmaniasis in Ethiopia. The literature search was conducted to identify all published studies reporting the prevalence of leishmaniasis with clearly designed inclusion and exclusion criteria. From all screened articles, 30 studies were eligible for final meta-analysis and systematic review. Because substantial heterogeneity was expected, random-effects meta-analyses were carried out using the total sample size and number of positives to estimate the prevalence of the disease at a country level. Between-study variability was high (τ(2) = 0.02; heterogeneity I(2) = 99.72\% with Heterogeneity chi-square = 11985.41, a degree of freedom = 33 and P = 0.001). The overall random pooled prevalence of leishmaniasis was 19\% (95\% CI 14\%-24\%). Meta-regression analysis showed that diagnosis method used have contributed to the heterogeneity of studies. Molecular diagnosis has significantly lower prevalence than microscopic examination with a coefficient of -0.32, a p-value of 0.024, and CI (-0.6-0.05). The result of effect estimates against its standard error showed there was no publication bias with a P value of 0.084. This review indicated that there is still a higher prevalence of Leishmaniasis in the country. Reporting on risk factors like sex and age affected, species of Leishmania involved and many more other risk factors reviewing was not possible in this study due to lack of completeness in articles included. However, this report is an indication that the country needs nationally coordinated extensive prevention and control plan to reduce public health and socio-economic impact of the disease.},

A systematic search was performed in December 2017, using Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, PubMed, ProQuest and Medline (via Ebscohost) electronic databases. The search was restricted to refereed journal articles published in English from January 2000 to November 2017. Thirty-one articles met the inclusion criteria. Using a modified quality assessment tool, the median quality score across studies was 14/16. The most popular Bayesian statistical approach to dengue modelling was a generalised linear mixed model with spatial random effects described by a conditional autoregressive prior. A limited number of studies included spatio-temporal random effects. Temperature and precipitation were shown to often influence the risk of dengue. Developing spatio-temporal random-effect models, considering other priors, using a dataset that covers an extended time period, and investigating other covariates would help to better understand and control DF transmission.},

	abstract = {Recently, the beneficial effects of ginger on obesity is taken into consideration. Albeit, it seems that the anti-obesity effect of ginger and its mechanism of action has not yet been reviewed. Therefore, the aim of this study was to systematically review the effect of Zingiber officinale Roscoe on obesity management. Databases including PubMed, Scopus, Google scholar, and Science Direct were searched from 1995 until May 2017 using the definitive keywords. Searching was limited to articles with English language. All of the relevant human and animal studies and also in vitro studies were included. Review articles, abstract in congress, and also other varieties of ginger were excluded. Eligibility of included articles were evaluated by 3 reviewers, which also extracted data. Articles were critically assessed individually for possible risk of bias. Twenty-seven articles (6 in vitro, 17 animal, and 4 human studies) were reviewed. Most of the experimental studies supported the weight lowering effect of ginger extract or powder in obese animal models, whereas the results of the available limited clinical studies showed no changes or slight changes of anthropometric measurements and body composition in subjects with obesity. Ginger could modulate obesity through various potential mechanisms including increasing thermogenesis, increasing lipolysis, suppression of lipogenesis, inhibition of intestinal fat absorption, and controlling appetite. This review article provides some convincing evidence to support the efficacy of ginger in obesity management and demonstrates the importance of future clinical trials.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cognitive impairment is an age-dependent chronic disorder that exponentially worsens with age; however, its treatment is mostly symptomatic. Moxibustion is widely accepted in East Asia as a treatment for cognitive impairment. This systematic review aimed to verify the efficacy and underlying mechanism of moxibustion in treating cognitive impairment. METHODS: Sixteen trials involving 324 animals obtained from MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane library, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wan-Fang, Cqvip, the Korean Studies Information Service System, and the Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System met the inclusion criteria. We extracted the results of behavioral tests and immunohistochemical biomarkers from the included articles and evaluated the risk of bias and reporting quality. RESULTS: The moxibustion group showed significantly decreased escape latency, increased crossing times, and prolonged dwelling times in the Morris water maze test. There was a significantly enhanced latency period and reduced error time in the step-down test and nerve behavior score. The effects of moxibustion were found to be mediated by suppression of oxidative stress and apoptosis, modulation of inflammation and Aβ genesis activation of vascular endothelial growth factor, and adjustment of metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty acid metabolism. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of moxibustion on cognitive impairment and suggested the putative mechanism. However, considering the small number of included studies, high bias risk, low reporting quality, and the limitations of animal experimentation, our results need to be confirmed by more detailed studies.},

Although some studies in invasion ecology demonstrated that native herbivores can preferentially feed on introduced plants and therefore contribute to the biotic resistance of native communities to plant invasions, the role of acridid grasshoppers as native generalist insect herbivores is largely overlooked. This systematic review aimed to identify patterns of grasshopper feeding preferences for native versus introduced plants and, consequently, a potential of grasshoppers to provide biotic resistance of native communities. The analysis of 63 records of feeding preference trials for 28 North-American grasshopper species (retrieved from 2146 studies published during 1967-2017) has demonstrated a preference of grasshoppers for introduced host plants, and identified 12 preferred introduced plants with high or middle invasive ranks. A significant effect of the life stage (p{\textless}0.001), but not the experimental environment, plant material, and measurements, on grasshopper preferences for introduced plants was also detected. Overall, results suggest a potential of acridid grasshoppers to contribute to the biotic resistance of native communities. The review also provides methodological recommendations for future experimental studies on grasshopper-host plant interactions.},

	abstract = {To better understand how relevant intensive systems' characteristics simultaneously affect the performance and welfare of broiler chickens, a meta-analysis of recent literature was carried out. The study determined the effects of gender, genetics, experimental initial age (EIA, d), stocking density (SD; kg/m2), group size (GS; n), bedding material (yes/no), duration of photoperiod (DP; h), divided scotoperiod (yes/no), feeding phases (1/2/3/{\textgreater}3), environmental control (EC; yes/no), environmental enrichment (yes/no), use of vaccines and other medications (yes/no), experimental duration (d), and relevant 2-way interactions on average daily gain (g/d), average daily feed intake (g/d), FCR (g: g), mortality (\%), behavior (\%), and gait score (mean value). Predictive equations for response variables were calculated using multiple regression models including a random experiment effect. Among other results, EIA × SD interaction indicated that relatively high SD may improve FCR at older ages, but parallel increased mortality would pose concerns about the actual productive benefits and welfare. Combining large GS and relatively low SD seem to improve performance and decrease flock disturbance. They would also increase leg problems, and so their actual benefits on welfare remain unclear. A gradual increase in FCR seems to occur with longer DP at older EIA (EIA × DP interaction), highlighting the importance of adapting light programs to flock age to optimize performance. The SD × DP and GS × DP interactions predicted increased FCR for longer DP at low SD or large GS, that is, with more effective space available. Longer DP combined with low SD or large GS would overall promote enhanced leg conditions, and therefore welfare. Predictions would not support scotoperiod division from both performance and welfare perspectives. The SD × EC interaction indicated that EC would benefit chicken performance at low SD, although EC would seem to increase leg problems. Our study highlights the complex, interactive nature of production systems' characteristics on broiler chicken performance and welfare.},

St John's wort (SJW), Hypericum perforatum, is a common remedy for mild depression, a problem prevalent in this population. Although the safety of herbal products must be investigated, ethical issues constrain intervention studies in humans. Hence, animal studies often inform clinical decisions. The objective of this study is to systematically review rodent studies assessing the safety of SJW during the perinatal period. A literature search to November 10, 2017, identified 10 rodent studies that met a priori inclusion criteria. Study quality was evaluated according to both the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory animal Experimentation tool for assessing bias and recommendations for appropriate reporting of herbal medicine research. Significant methodological limitations were found in each of the studies reviewed. These limitations include the lack of botanical verification and omission of extract characterization, inadequate explanation of dosage rationale, and absence of bias limiting protocols. Critical appraisal with contemporary tools indicates that each of the reviewed studies lacks appropriate rigour, rendering the results unreliable. Despite this, these papers are used in the rationale for recommending or contraindicating SJW during pregnancy and lactation.},

The aim of this work therefore, was to review publicly available literature on the pharmacotherapeutic activities of T. occidentalis. Searches were performed on PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar for related studies, with search dates set between 1990 and 2018. A total of 499 articles were retrieved and analyzed, with 38 studies ultimately retained. Studies contained in this review were carried out in Nigeria, across different locations. 13 categories of pharmacological activities for fluted pumpkin were documented after analyzing full texts of the articles retained. T. occidentalis offers myriad of healing properties that can be explored by pharmaceutical industries. As the search for potent drugs from botanical sources continues, there is need for future investigations to isolate and characterize pharmacologically active agents that confer medicinal properties on fluted pumpkin, as well as elucidate the structures of these agents and pathways by which they exert their healing properties.},

The occurrence of Escherichia coli in foods of animal origin in Ethiopia is arguably high due to many reasons like illegal slaughtering of animals in open fields, unhygienic slaughter practices in the abattoirs, and the risk of disease due to this organism is high because of a widespread tradition of raw meat consumption. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to pool estimates of the prevalence of the organism in different foods of animal origin which is the first of its kind in the country. The literature search was conducted to identify all published articles reporting the prevalence of Escherichia coli in foods of animal origin. From all screened articles, nine studies were eligible for final systematic review and meta-analysis. Because substantial heterogeneity was expected, random-effects meta-analyses were carried out to pool the prevalence of the organism from different foods of animal origin. Prevalence of the organism was found to be 4\% (95\% CI = 3\%-5\%) in foods of animal origin. This systematic review and meta-analysis showed the level of contamination of foods of animal origin in Ethiopia is high indicating the need for immediate planning of mitigation strategies and detection methods to reduce its level and impact throughout the country.},

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) was conducted to identify articles from inception until January 2021, utilizing six databases. Controlled trials that compared the effects of different protein types were analyzed using random-effects meta-analysis. Quality assessment and risk of bias of the included articles were assessed by using Cochrane risk of bias instrument and ROBINS-I. Out of the 10 studies that met the criteria, there was a decreasing trend in CRP levels when consuming plant proteins compared to animal proteins among non-dialysis participants. There was a statistically significant decrease when comparing animal proteins to unspecified proteins in CRP levels among dialysis participants [Hedges' g = 2.11; 95\% CI 1.12, 3.11; p ≤ 0.001], favoring unspecified proteins. Furthermore, animal proteins (eggs, red meat) showed increasing trends in CRP levels compared to whey protein isolate. Caution must be considered regarding these results as controlled, non-randomized, trials were included in the analysis, which may have contributed to high risk of bias.

Even though it is easily treatable disease, its prevalence is high and continuous as neglected tropical disease of resource-poor settings, and particularly affects young age groups. Despite of these facts, studies conducted in Ethiopia regarding to the prevalence and associated factors for scabies infestation have been highly variable and didn't well compiled. Due to that, the aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimates the overall prevalence of scabies and associated factors in all age groups in Ethiopia. METHODS: International databases (PubMed/PMC/Midline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Google and Science Direct) were systematically searched from December 1, 2019, to January 18, 2020. All observational studies noted the prevalence of human scabies and associated factors in Ethiopia were included. Two authors (AG and G.T) independently extracted all necessary data using a standardized data extraction format. The data which is extracted each study were analyzed using STATA Version 14.1. Heterogeneity among the included studies was assessed through the Cochrane Q test statistics and I(2) test. Lastly, a random effects meta-analysis model was computed to fix overall prevalence and associated factors of scabies. RESULTS: Twelve studies were included in this meta-analysis after 410 articles retrieved. Of these, eight studies were analyzed for prevalence estimation. The overall prevalence of scabies infestation was 14.5\% (95\%CI: 1.5, 27.6\%) in Ethiopia. Furthermore, the subgroup analysis revealed the highest prevalence was 19.6\% in Amhara region. A person from a large family size (OR: 3.1, 95\% CI: 1.76, 5.67), and sharing a bed (OR: 3.59, 95\%CI: 2.88, 4.47) were significantly associated with scabies. CONCLUSION: This study revealed the prevalence of scabies infestation was 14.5\% in Ethiopia which was high. Persons from high family size and any contact with scabies case were factors associated with scabies.},

	abstract = {Animals kept in zoos face constant threats to their well-being. An animal is in high welfare when it is experiencing complete physical and mental health. Some strategies are used to maintain the well-being of zoo animals at high levels, such as environmental enrichment. Environmental enrichment consists of inserting stimuli into the animals' enclosures so that they have the opportunity to exhibit behaviors that are closer to the natural, improving their physical and psychological health. The present study aimed to evaluate, through a bibliometric analysis, how Brazilian zoos have used the technique of environmental enrichment to improve the welfare of their animals, as well as to list gaps that may guide future studies with this theme by the managers/Zoo technicians and researchers. The data were collected on three databases: The Web of Science copyright , Plataforma CAPES copyright and Google Scholar copyright . The keywords used for searching for articles in these databases were: "environmental enrichment, zoo, Brazil". The survey was performed from 1945 until 2016. Fifty-two studies, which began in 2006, were evaluated; most of them in zoos in the Southeast of Brazil, with carnivores and primates, and using more than one type of environmental enrichment. Most of the studies was behaviorally evaluated and showed positive effects to the animals. We conclude that studies on the effects of environmental enrichment in the country are still incipient, although they are in rapid growth. Environmental enrichment studies should: consider a greater number of animal species; be delineated with quality, especially concerning the sample size; and be performed by more zoos in Brazil. Finally, studies should be disseminated in quality scientific communication media, so that they can be replicated not only in Brazil but also in zoos around the world.},

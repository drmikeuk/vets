	abstract = {Through a systematic review of literature comprising publications between 1973 and 2009, the following databases were consulted: Science Direct, EBSCO, Springer Link and MEDLINE. Key words used included stray dogs, animal-human bond, pet population, overpopulation and population control. The databases of the World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA) and the International Organization of Epizootics (OIE) were also consulted. The objective of the present review was to present a critical position about the pet overpopulation problem, cultural perception and relationships between human and animals, and failures associated with this relationship with the purpose of establishing possible solutions to the problem taking into consideration cultural issues. A total of 16 references were found, which, we applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles that met these criteria are those that constitute the unit of analysis of this review. As the knowledge about responsible ownership of pets is increased, the bond with them is enhanced. Only through health education, it is possible to acquire the necessary knowledge needed to avoid failures with respect to proper keeping. In this respect the veterinarian plays a pivotal role with his community.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the methodology for and utilization of tissue oxygen monitoring by near infrared spectroscopy, and to review the current literature on the use of this monitoring modality in human and veterinary settings. DATA SOURCES: Scientific reviews and original research found using the PubMed and CAB Abstract search engines with the following keywords: "tissue oxygen monitoring," "near-infrared tissue spectroscopy," and "tissue oxygen saturation (StO2 )." HUMAN DATA SYNTHESIS: Tissue oxygen monitors have been evaluated in a wide variety of human clinical applications including trauma and triage, surgery, sepsis, and septic shock, and early goal-directed therapy. StO2 more rapidly identifies occult shock in human patients compared to traditional methods, which can lead to earlier intervention in these patients. VETERINARY DATA SYNTHESIS: Veterinary studies involving tissue oxygen monitoring are limited, but the technology may have utility for identification of hemorrhagic shock earlier than changes in base excess, blood lactate concentration, or other traditional perfusion parameters. CONCLUSION: Tissue oxygen monitoring is most commonly performed utilizing a noninvasive, portable monitor, which provides real-time, continuous, repeatable StO2 measurements. A decline in StO2 is an early indicator of shock in both human and veterinary patients. Low StO2 values in human patients are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and length of hospitalization, as well as the development of multiple organ system dysfunction and surgical site infections.},

	abstract = {Dietary vitamin E supplementation provides a feasible option to extend the shelf life of meat. However, the costs of extra supplementation necessitate an accurate level of feeding to achieve the maximum return in product quality improvement. The current study aimed to quantify the effects of total dietary vitamin E intake on muscle alpha-tocopherol concentration in cattle and pigs, and to relate muscle alpha-tocopherol concentration to lipid oxidation and color of meat. Through computerized and manual searches, 13 studies with cattle and 10 with pigs were identified that have presented data on dietary vitamin E intake and muscle alpha-tocopherol concentration. Treatment means from 12 studies with beef and 14 with pork were used to evaluate the effects of muscle alpha-tocopherol concentration on lipid oxidation, as represented by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in meat stored or retail displayed at chilled temperatures. With CIELAB a* (redness) values as an indicator of color development, the association between muscle alpha-tocopherol concentration and color could be evaluated with treatment means from 8 studies with beef and 5 with pork. Different treatments applied within studies resulted in 20 to 66 values available for the respective regression analyses. Relationships could be described effectively by different forms of the Mitscherlich model, which presented an initial value for y when x = 0, an asymptotic plateau, and the rate of change of y with increasing values of x. With the inclusion of experiment as a random effect, the relationship between total dietary vitamin E intake (x, IU/d for cattle and mg/d for pigs) and muscle alpha-tocopherol concentration (y, microg/g of meat) reached asymptotic plateau values at 5.71 and 4.83 microg/g of meat for cattle and pigs, respectively. The fractional accumulation rate (per total dietary vitamin E intake) of muscle alpha-tocopherol concentration was considerably greater in pigs (0.0130) than in cattle (0.00174). The form of the relationship between muscle alpha-tocopherol concentration and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in pork was influenced by a single value, whereas muscle alpha-tocopherol concentrations could not be related to a* values in beef. This study presented viable models that could be applied in practice to calculate the amounts of supplemental dietary vitamin E needed to obtain the maximum profit from beef and pork.},

	abstract = {Technological meat quality is a significant economic factor in pork production, and numerous publications have shown that it is strongly influenced both by genetic status and by rearing and slaughter conditions. The quality of meat is often described by meat pH at different times postmortem, as well as by color and drip loss, whereas carcass quality is often characterized by lean percentage. A meta-analysis of findings relating to 3,530 pigs reported in 23 publications was carried out to assess the effects of the halothane gene, sex, breed, and slaughter weight of animals on 7 selected variables: pH at 45 min postmortem, ultimate pH, reflectance (L*-value), redness (a*-value), yellowness (b*-value), drip loss, and lean percentage. Two statistical methods were used in the meta-analysis: the method of effect size and the better known random effects model. The method of effect size was associated with Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques for implementing Bayesian hierarchical models to avoid the problems of limited data and publication bias. The results of our meta-analysis showed that the halothane genotype had a significant effect on all analyzed pork quality variables. Between-study variance was evaluated with the Cochran (1954) Q-test of heterogeneity. Meta-regression was used to explain this variance, with covariates such as breed, sex, slaughter weight, and fasting duration being integrated into different regression models. The halothane gene effect was associated with the breed effect only for the following variables: L*-value, b*-value, and drip loss. Slaughter weight contributed significantly only to the explanation of differences in ultimate pH between homozygous genotypes. In response to inconsistencies reported in the literature regarding the difference between the genotypes NN and Nn, results of the meta-analysis showed that the difference between these 2 genotypes was significant for all the analyzed variables except the a*-value.},

A meta-analysis based on a database built from 27 studies corresponding to a total of 6526 animals classified was carried out. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to study the effect of fasting, lairage and transport durations on four main attributes of the technological pork meat quality. A Bayesian hierarchical meta-regression approach was adopted. The results of our meta-analysis showed that fasting time had a significant effect on pH measured 24h post-mortem (pHu) and drip loss (DL) measured in longissimus muscle. While, lairage affected only the pHu in semimembranosus muscle. Interestingly, we found that DL was the lone attribute that was affected by transport time and its interaction with fasting time.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Occupational exposure to bio-aerosols has been linked to various health effects. This review presents an overview of bio-aerosol exposure levels in veterinary practices, and investigates the possibility of health effects associated with bio-aerosol exposure. METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out in PubMed. Publications were included if they provided information on bio-aerosol exposure and related health effects through veterinary practice and other professions with similar exposures, occupationally exposed to animals. RESULTS: Few studies in veterinary settings showed that substantial bio-aerosol exposure levels (e.g. endotoxin and beta(1--{\textgreater}3)-glucan) were likely occur when handling farm animals and horses. Exposure levels are comparable to those levels observed in farming which have been associated with respiratory health effects. Animal specific allergen exposures have hardly been studied, but showed to be measurable in companion animal clinics and dairy barns. The Findings of the few studies available among veterinary populations, particularly those working with farm animals and horses, are indicative of an elevated risk for developing respiratory symptoms. Studies among pig farmers, exposed to similar environments as veterinarians, strongly confirm that veterinary populations are at an increased risk of developing respiratory diseases in relation to bio-aerosol exposure, in particular endotoxin. Exposure to animal allergens during veterinary practice may cause allergic inflammation, characterized by IgE-mediated reactions to animal allergens. Nonetheless, the occurrence of sensitization or allergy against animal allergens is poorly described, apart from laboratory animal allergy, especially known from exposure to rats and mice. CONCLUSION: Veterinary populations are likely exposed to elevated levels of bio-aerosols such as endotoxins, beta(1--{\textgreater}3)-glucans, and some specific animal allergens. Exposures to these agents in animal farmers are associated with allergic and non-allergic respiratory effects, proposing similar health effects in veterinary populations.},

The literature search included peer-reviewed journals (both full articles and abstracts), conference proceedings and theses and included documents written in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese or Italian. The study outcome was defined as the difference in milk production (kg/cow per day) between treated and untreated cows. Random effect meta-analyses were performed on 75 trials published between 1972 and 2002. The combined estimate after controlling for publication bias and/or small-study effect was of 0.35 kg/cow per day. Significant variation among studies was detected and although several variables were associated with the study outcome, they did not significantly reduce the unexplained variability among trials. Trials reporting the use of endectocides had higher milk-production response compared with trials using older anthelmintics. Similarly, whole-herd treatment trials or trials which applied the treatment in mid-lactation or strategically throughout the year had higher response compared with calving or dry-period treatment trials. Trials reporting the results as total 305-day milk production had lower response compared with trials which measured production as daily milk weight. Primiparous cows trials had lower responses compared with multiparous cows trials.},

	abstract = {A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to identify study-level variables that could explain the variation in apparent Salmonella spp. prevalence estimates. Electronic and non-electronic literature searches from 1990 until 2005 were carried out to identify all studies related to the prevalence of subclinical Salmonella infection in swine. The searches were restricted to studies published in English, Spanish, and French. Clinical trials or any other study where an intervention was evaluated were excluded from this analysis. A template was designed to retrieve the most relevant variables and data abstraction was performed in duplicate. A total of 98 papers containing 82 animal-level and 156 farm-level studies were used in the analyses. The median farm-level and animal-level prevalences were 59\% and 17\%, respectively. Meta-regression analyses were carried out on both farm and animal-level data. Diagnostic procedure, sample size, and country where study was conducted were the three most important predictors in explaining the differences in Salmonella prevalences between studies. When compared to a farm with a apparent prevalence of 50\% determined by the blood ELISA, prevalences based on culture of fecal samples were 39\% lower and prevalences based on cecum and tissue cultures were 16\% and 19\% lower, respectively. Similar to farm-level models, animal-level models did not show any difference among serological tests and prevalence values based culture procedures were, on average, 9\% lower than those from serological tests. Sample size was negatively associated with prevalence estimates. In conclusion, the methodology was useful for identifying and quantifying sources of variation in Salmonella apparent prevalence among studies and for establishing prevalence distributions that could be used as input parameters in risk assessment and decision models. The analysis provides some guidelines when interpreting and comparing apparent Salmonella prevalence results from studies using different study designs.},

Therefore, a literature search was conducted in Journal of Dairy Science, Theriogenology, Animal Reproduction Science and The Veterinary Journal utilizing the ScienceDirect database. The search revealed 259 articles addressing APM. After applying exclusion criteria, a total of 48 trials remained. It was determined whether the author gave a clear definition of APM, the time of diagnosis relative to calving, and the person who performed the diagnosis. Studies were checked for the presence of definitions of possible findings, thresholds, and test characteristics of the methods used. Overall 9 different diagnostic methods were employed. On average 2.5 +/- 1.75 diagnostic methods were used in a study. References to support the use of the diagnostic methods were provided in 10 of 48 articles (20.8\%). Vaginal discharge, transrectal palpation and rectal temperature were examined in 39, 22, and 21 of the studies, respectively. Thresholds for diagnostic tests and test characteristics were mentioned in 6 and 3 of the 48 articles, respectively. Based on this systematic review of 48 research papers the evidence supporting the use of the diagnostic methods to identify cows with APM has either been not reported or is weak. In conclusion, the reporting of the diagnostic methods to identify cows with APM needs to be improved and further high-quality research is necessary to improve diagnostic performance of the methods employed.},

The methodology consisted of an extensive search to identify all potentially relevant research, screening of titles and abstracts for relevance to the research question, quality assessment of relevant research, extraction of data from research of sufficient quality, and qualitative summarization of results. The interventions evaluated included probiotics, vaccination, antimicrobials, sodium chlorate, bacteriophages and other feed additives. There was evidence of efficacy for the probiotic combination Lactobacillus acidophilus NP51 (NPC 747) and Propionibacterium freudenreichii and for sodium chlorate in feed or water. The effectiveness of vaccination varied among studies and among vaccine protocols and there was no consistent evidence to suggest that antibiotic use was associated with a decrease in faecal shedding of E. coli O157, or that current industry uses of antimicrobials were associated with increased faecal shedding. There were an insufficient number of studies available to address the effectiveness of bacteriophages and several other feed additives. In general, few of the primary studies evaluated the interventions under commercial housing conditions with a natural disease challenge, there were inconsistencies in the results among study designs and in some cases among studies within study designs, and a relatively large proportion of publications were excluded based on quality assessment criteria. Few studies reported on associations between the proposed intervention and production parameters, such as average daily gain and feed: gain ratio. While the results suggest that some interventions may be efficacious, there are knowledge gaps in our understanding of the efficacy of pre-harvest interventions to increase animal resistance to E. coli O157 that require further targeted research.},

METHODS: In the current study, data collection (published and unpublished papers, abstracts of national scientific congresses and dissertations) using particular terms was carried out systematically on the following electronic databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, Ebsco, Science Direct, Scopus, Magiran, Irandoc, IranMedex and SID (Scientific Information Database). RESULTS: A total of 22 studies since 1983 to 2012 reporting the seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in cattle from different regions of Iran met our eligibility criteria. The pooled proportion of toxoplasmosis, using random effect model, among cattle in Iran from over the 30-year period was estimated 18.1\% (95\% CI: 9.9\% to 28.2\%). CONCLUSIONS: This study firstly establishes a crude seroprevalence rate of Toxoplasma infection in cattle which can lead us to understand the condition of cattle toxoplasmosis, which have to take into accounted for an appropriate and effective prevention and controls. Secondly, it compares and discusses elaborately the role of risk factors including sex, age and breed in the epidemiology of the disease. Thus, it determines gaps and drawbacks in the prior studies which are greatly useful to design more accurate investigations in the future.},

	abstract = {Aim: Parasitic infections, especially of the zoonotic-parasitic type, are the most important health, economic, and social problems in developing countries, including Iran. The aim of this study was to review systematically the available data on gastrointestinal parasites of carnivores in Iran and their ability to infect humans. Materials and Methods: Studies reporting intestinal parasites of carnivores were systematically collected from nine electronic English and Persian databases and Proceedings of Iranian parasitology and veterinary congresses published between 1997 and 2015. A total of 26 studies issued from 1997 to 2015 met the eligibility criteria. Results: The pooled proportion of intestinal parasites of carnivores was estimated as 80.4\% (95\% confidence interval=70.2-88.8\%). The overall prevalence of gastrointestinal parasites in dogs, cats, foxes, and jackals were 57.89\%, 90.62\%, 89.17\%, and 97.32\%, respectively. Dipylidium caninum (20.45\%), Toxocara spp. (18.81\%), Taenia hydatigena (15.28\%), Mesocestoides lineatus (11.83\%), Echinococcus granulosus (10\%), and Toxascaris leonina (8.69\%) were the most frequently observed parasites. Conclusion: High prevalence rates of zoonotic intestinal parasites of carnivores particularly Echinococcus spp. and Toxocara spp. increase the risk of acquiring zoonotic infections such as cystic hydatid, alveolar cysts, and visceral or ocular larva migrants in Iranian people. Therefore, it is essential for public health centers to develop more effective control strategies to decrease infections rates in carnivores' populations.},

More information obtained with non-invasive measurement techniques to assess normal and abnormal gait in cats would provide a greater insight into their locomotion and biomechanics and improve the objective measurement of disease alterations and treatment modalities. In this systematic review, 12 previously performed studies that investigated ground reaction force measurements in cats during locomotion were evaluated. The aims of these studies, the measurement methods and equipment used, and the outcomes of parameters used to assess both sound and diseased cats are summarised and discussed. All reviewed studies used pressure sensitive walkways to gain data and all provided an acclimatisation period as a prerequisite for measurements. In sound cats during walking, the forelimb peak vertical force was greater than in the hindlimb and the peak vertical force in the hindlimb was greater in cats than in dogs. This review confirms that ground reaction forces can be used to evaluate lameness and treatment effects in the cat.},

We conducted a systematic review of English and Chinese language peer-reviewed and grey literature databases to identify zoonotic endoparasite research utilizing an OH approach in community-based settings. Our review identified 32 articles where specimens collected simultaneously from all three OH domains (people, animals, and the environment) were assessed for endoparasite infection or exposure. Study sites spanned 23 countries, and research teams brought together an average of seven authors from two countries. Surveillance of blood-borne and gastrointestinal protozoa were most frequently reported (19 of 32; 59\%), followed by trematodes, nematodes, and cestodes. Laboratory techniques varied greatly between studies, and only 16 identified parasites using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in all three OH domains. Our review identified important gaps in parasitology research operating under an OH framework. We recommend that investigators working in the realm of zoonotic disease strive to evaluate all three OH domains by integrating modern molecular tools as well as techniques provided by economists and social scientists.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The study of occupational stress and compassion fatigue in personnel working in animal-related occupations has gained momentum over the last decade. However, there remains incongruence in understanding what is currently termed compassion fatigue and the associated unique contributory factors. Furthermore, there is minimal established evidence of the likely influence of these conditions on the health and well-being of individuals working in various animal-related occupations. OBJECTIVE: To assess currently available evidence and terminology regarding occupational stress and compassion fatigue in personnel working in animal shelters, veterinary clinics, and biomedical research facilities. DATA SOURCE: Studies were identified by searching the following electronic databases with no publication date restrictions: ProQuest Research Library, ProQuest Social Science Journals, PsycARTICLES, Web of Science, Science Direct, Scopus, PsychINFO databases, and Google Scholar. Search terms included (euthanasia AND animals) OR (compassion fatigue AND animals) OR (occupational stress AND animals). STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS: Only articles published in English in peer-reviewed journals that included use of quantitative or qualitative techniques to investigate the incidence of occupational stress or compassion fatigue in the veterinary profession or animal-related occupations were included. On the basis of predefined criteria, 1 author extracted articles, and the data set was then independently reviewed by the other 2 authors. RESULTS: 12 articles met the selection criteria and included a variety of study designs and methods of data analysis. Seven studies evaluated animal shelter personnel, with the remainder evaluating veterinary nurses and technicians (2), biomedical research technicians (1), and personnel in multiple animal-related occupations (2). There was a lack of consistent terminology and agreed definitions for the articles reviewed. Personnel directly engaged in euthanasia reported significantly higher levels of work stress and lower levels of job satisfaction, which may have resulted in higher employee turnover, psychological distress, and other stress-related conditions. LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Results of this review suggested a high incidence of occupational stress and euthanasia-related strain in animal care personnel. The disparity of nomenclature and heterogeneity of research methods may contribute to general misunderstanding and confusion and impede the ability to generate high-quality evidence regarding the unique stressors experienced by personnel working with animals. The present systematic review provided insufficient foundation from which to identify consistent causal factors and outcomes to use as a basis for development of evidence-based stress management programs, and it highlights the need for further research.},

METHOD: Selected quantitative studies published in peer-reviewed journals were reviewed for inclusion; the gray literature and white papers were also explored. Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) criteria and Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) were applied to all studies. Fourteen full reports meeting a priori inclusion criteria were extracted from 103 studies accessed through 16 electronic databases and a hand search. Data were synthesized in relation to three research questions informing evidence-based practice. RESULTS: No randomized clinical trials were located. Two studies provided a moderate level of evidence for effectiveness. Nine studies demonstrated statistically significant positive effects. Three studies did not find significant psychosocial effects for the target group, although one found significant positive effects for the comparison group. CONCLUSION: In the aggregate, the evidence is promising in support of the effectiveness of complementary and adjunct interventions employing equines in the treatment of health challenges. Future studies are needed that utilize rigorous and creative designs, especially longitudinal studies and comparisons with established effective treatments.},

This review and meta-analysis study was performed to evaluate the overall prevalence of T. gondii infection among sheep and goats in Iran. Data were systematically collected from 1977 to 2012 in Iran on the following electronic databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, Magiran, Irandoc, IranMedex, and Scientific Information Database (SID). Additionally, abstracts of national scientific congresses and dissertations were included. A total of 34 articles in field of sheep and 18 articles about goat toxoplasmosis, totalizing to the examination of 14,372 sheep and 3,120 goats, reporting prevalence of toxoplasmosis from different regions of Iran fulfilled our eligibility criteria. The overall prevalence rate of toxoplasmosis in Iran was estimated to be 31 \% (95 \% confidence interval (CI) = 0.259825 to 0.352382) in sheep and 27 \% (95 \% CI = 0.140097 to 0.424782) in goats, respectively. There was no significant difference in infection rate between males and females among sheep (odds ratio (OR) = 1.002, 95 \% CI = 0.59 to 1.696) and goats (OR = 1.027, 95 \% CI = 0.685 to 1.541). Analysis revealed that infection rate in sheep over than 1 year old was 2.4 times more than that in less than 1 year old (OR = 2.396, 95 \% CI = 1.050 to 5.467). This systematic review and meta-analysis study revealed that infection is widespread in Iran. Further studies are required to improve strategies for controlling infection among flocks and consequently in human population.},

	abstract = {There is a considerable controversy regarding the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock wave therapy (SWT) in the management of equine orthopaedic diseases. Therefore the aim of this review was a breakdown of current SWT research including technical features, effects on tissue, potential adverse effects and the current clinical evidence for its use in musculoskeletal diseases in horses. Computerised searches were performed using Pub Med, Scopus and Web Spirs databases from 1980 to 2007. The studies were subdivided in equine experimental and clinical studies and classified according to the type of shock waver generator and to the quality of the study design. The search strategy identified a total of 39 studies in horses. These studies could be differentiated into 18 experimental studies and 21 clinical studies. Regarding the experimental studies effects of SWT were described for bone, tendons and nerves with conspicuous differences between different tissues. 61.1\% of the experimental studies showed significant effects after SWT Within the clinical studies effectiveness of SWT ranged from no influence to 100\% of the horses resuming full work. The majority of the clinical studies deals with proximal suspendory disease and navicular disease. 22 studies (56.4\%) used a focused device or extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) and 13 studies (33.3\%) used a nonfocused device or radial pressure wave therapy (RPWT). 4 studies (10.2\%) compared the 2 shock wave devices: 3 of these studies showed no effects neither with ESWT nor with RPWT In the fourth study both devices caused microcracks in bone, but of different kind. The review reveals a great inhomogeneity across studies. Experimental studies show various tissue effects. Within the clinical studies there is a moderate evidence that SWT is effective in PSD and navicular disease. However due of the lack of high quality studies results should be seen with caution.},

The use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) has been identified as a tool to maintain the intestinal microbial balance and to prevent the establishment of opportunistic pathogenic bacterial populations. However, a consensus has not been reached as to whether probiotics may be effective in reducing the prevalence of gastrointestinal diseases in young calves. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the effect of probiotics on diarrhea incidence and the intestinal microbial balance. LAB supplementation has been shown to exert a protective effect and to reduce the incidence of diarrhea (relative risk, RR=0.437, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.251-0.761). In the subanalysis, this protective effect of the probiotics against diarrhea was observed only in trials that used whole milk (RR=0.154, 95\% CI 0.079-0.301) and trials that used multistrain inocula (RR=0.415, 95\% CI 0.227-0.759). Probiotics did not improve the fecal characteristics (standardized mean difference, SMD=-0.4904, 95\% CI -1.011-0.035) and were unable to change the LAB:coliforms ratio (SMD=0.016, 95\% CI -0.701-0.733). Probiotics showed a beneficial impact on the LAB:coliforms ratio in the subanalysis that included trials that used whole milk (SMD=0.780, 95\% CI 0.141-1.418) and monostrain inocula (SMD=0.990, 95\% CI 0.340-1.641). The probability of significant effects (probiotic positive effect) in a new study was {\textgreater}0.70 for diarrhea and fecal consistency. Whole milk feeding improved the action of the probiotic effect on the incidence of diarrhea and LAB:coliforms ratio. The probability to find significant effects in the diarrhea frequency and LAB:coliforms ratio was higher (P{\textgreater}0.85) if the new studies were conducted using whole milk to feed calves. This paper defines the guidelines to standardize the experimental designs of future trials. LAB can be used as growth promoters in calves instead of antibiotics to counteract the negative effects of their widespread use.},

	abstract = {This systematic review aimed to assess the efficacy of sildenafil in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in dogs and, when possible, to propose recommendations for or against its use. Electronic searches were carried out using six international databases. The inclusion criterion was in vivo clinical trials that assessed the efficacy of sildenafil in the treatment of naturally occurring PH. The scoring system was designed to take into account aspects such as the form of distribution and masking of experimental treatments, the number of animals, association with other drugs, diagnostic methods for PH, evaluations of the clinical response to treatment and adverse effects. A total of five papers were found. In general, the clinical condition and quality of life of the animals improved after sildenafil therapy, and the occurrence of adverse effects was uncommon. Echocardiographic findings provided evidence for changes in pulmonary arterial pressure which could be associated with alterations in physical activity and survival time. Still, the methodological quality of the studies was low, only one of them was a randomised, placebo-controlled and double-blind clinical trial. Furthermore, with modest evidence, this study allowed the recommendation that sildenafil is an important therapy which can play a positive therapeutic role in the treatment of canine PH. Additionally, prospective, randomised, blinded and controlled studies with a larger number of animals assessing physical activity and the adverse effects of sildenafil and other drugs in association are recommended to evaluate the efficacy of this drug in dogs.},

To develop more precise estimates of the effects of halofuginone on calf cryptosporidiosis, meta-analyses were performed, including studies on prophylactic and therapeutic treatment. Meta-analysis increases statistical power because several trials are evaluated together, increasing the effective sample size and possibility of detecting true effects. In total, 20 cohort or clinical studies (in 16 publications) investigating halofuginone treatment in calves were identified. One study was excluded because treated calves and control calves were not investigated in parallel. Four studies (three publications) were excluded because only abstracts were available. Thus, 15 studies from 12 publications, with 10-311 calves were included for data extraction. Of these, five studies from three publications could not be used for meta-analysis because they did not report the data needed. Effects on infection prevalence, diarrhoeal prevalence and mortality were investigated. For prophylactic treatment, halofuginone had an effect on infection and diarrhoeal prevalence on study days 4 and 7, but the control group had significantly lower infection prevalence than the halofuginone treated group on study day 21. Heterogeneity was detected on study days 14 and 21 and publication bias was detected on study days 7 and 14. Mortality was not affected. For therapeutic treatment, a shortage of studies in combination with heterogeneity made interpretations uncertain, and we could not determine if halofuginone treatment benefits calves.},

	doi = {10.1111/vec.12282},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review and appraise common vasopressor drugs used to treat septic shock-induced hypotension in volume replete animals. DATA SOURCES: Human and animal publications were searched using PubMed without time limits and the following keywords were used: "vasopressor," "septic shock," "norepinephrine," "dopamine," "epinephrine," and "vasopressin." HUMAN DATA SYNTHESIS: The choice of vasopressor drug is unlikely to have a marked impact on outcome, but the incidence of adverse events (eg, tachycardia) varies greatly between the various treatment options. In agreement with the 2012 Cochrane Database consensus, norepinephrine is the first-choice vasopressor to maintain a mean arterial pressure {\textgreater}/=65 mm Hg. If an additional agent is required, epinephrine should be administered. Low-dose vasopressin can be added to norepinephrine to either increase the arterial blood pressure to the target goal value or decrease the norepinephrine dose, but should not be used as the initial vasopressor. Dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances. VETERINARY DATA SYNTHESIS: There is insufficient evidence to make definitive conclusions regarding the treatment of naturally occurring septic shock, but clinical studies are underway to provide further data. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of hypotension in people or animals with septic shock is challenging and vasopressor therapy is associated with a variety of adverse effects. Further research is warranted in dogs and cats to establish evidence-based guidelines.},

	abstract = {Marine mammals are often cited as "sentinels of ocean health" yet accessible, synthesized data on their health changes that could effectively warn of ocean health changes are rare. The objectives of this study were to 1) perform a systematic review of published cases of marine mammal disease to determine spatial and temporal trends in disease from 1972-2012, including changes in regions and taxa affected and specific causes; and 2) compare numbers of published cases of neoplasia with known, hospital-based neoplasia records to explore the causes of discrepancy between numbers of published cases and true disease trends. Peer-reviewed literature was compiled, and data were collected from The Marine Mammal Center database in Sausalito, California for comparison of numbers of neoplasia cases. Toxicoses from harmful algal blooms appear to be increasing. Viral epidemics are most common along the Atlantic U.S. coastline, while bacterial epidemics, especially leptospirosis, are most common along the Pacific coast. Certain protozoal and fungal zoonoses appear to be emerging, such as Toxoplasma gondii in southern sea otters in California, and Cryptococcus gattii in cetaceans in the Pacific Northwest. Disease reports were most common from California where pinniped populations are large, but increased effort also occurs. Anthropogenic trauma remains a large threat to marine mammal health, through direct mortality and indirect chronic disease. Neoplasia cases were under-reported from 2003-2012 when compared to true number of cases, and over-reported in several years due to case duplication. Peer-reviewed literature greatly underestimates the true magnitude of disease in marine mammals as it focuses on novel findings, fails to reflect etiology of multifactorial diseases, rarely reports prevalence rather than simple numbers of cases, and is typically presented years after a disease first occurs. Thus literature cannot guide management actions adequately, nor inform indices of ocean health. A real-time, nationally centralized system for reporting marine mammal disease data is needed to be able to understand how marine mammal diseases are changing with ecosystem changes, and before these animals can truly be considered 'sentinels of ocean health'.},

It was the aim of this systematic review to assess the effects of oral administration of antimicrobials on the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Escherichia coli (E. coli) from chickens. Moreover, the effects of the administration of more than one antimicrobial and of different dosages were studied. Literature was searched in November 2012 from the electronic databases ISI Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus and a national literature database (DIMDI) as well as the database ProQuest LLC. The search was updated in March 2014. Original studies describing a treatment (A) and a control group of either non-treatment (C) or initial value (0) and determining AMR in E. coli at different sample points (SP) were included. The literature search resulted in 35 full text articles on the topic, seven (20\%) of which contained sufficient information on the administered antimicrobial and the impact of treatment on AMR. Most papers described the use of more than one antimicrobial, several dosages, controls (non-treatment or pre-treatment) and measured AMR at different SPs leading to a total of 227 SPs on the impact of the use of antimicrobials on AMR in chickens. 74\% of the SPs (168/227) described a higher AMR-rate in E. coli from treated animals than from controls. After the administration of a single antimicrobial, AMR increased at 72\% of the SPs. Administration of more than one antimicrobial increased AMR at 82\% of the SPs. Higher dosages were associated with similar or higher AMR rates. The limited number of studies for each antimicrobial agent and the high variability in the resistance effect call for more well designed studies on the impact of oral administration on AMR development and spread.},

	abstract = {In light of increasing global protein prices and with the need to reduce environmental impact of contemporary systems of milk production, the current review seeks to assess the feasibility of reducing levels of dietary CP in dairy cow diets. At CP levels between 140 and 220 g/kg DM there is a strong positive relationship between CP concentration and dry matter intake (DMI). However, such effects are modest and reductions in DMI when dietary CP is below 180 g/kg DM can be at least partially offset by improving the digestibility and amino acid profile of the undegradable protein (UDP) component of the diet or by increasing rumen fermentable energy. Level and balance of intestinally absorbable amino acids, in particular methionine and lysine, may become limiting at lower CP concentrations. In general the amino acid composition of microbial protein is superior to that of UDP, so that dietary strategies that aim to promote microbial protein synthesis in the rumen may go some way to correcting for amino acid imbalances in low CP diets. For example, reducing the level of NDF, while increasing the proportion of starch, can lead to improvements in nitrogen (N) utilisation as great as that achieved by reducing dietary CP to below 150 g/kg. A systematic review and meta-analysis of responses to rumen protected forms of methionine and lysine was conducted for early/mid lactation cows fed diets containing 150 g CP/kg DM. This analysis revealed a small but significant (P=0.002) increase in milk protein yield when cows were supplemented with these rumen protected amino acids. Variation in milk and milk protein yield responses between studies was not random but due to differences in diet composition between studies. Cows fed low CP diets can respond to supplemental methionine and lysine so long as DMI is not limiting, metabolisable protein (MP) is not grossly deficient and other amino acids such as histidine and leucine do not become rate limiting. Whereas excess dietary protein can impair reproduction and can contribute to lameness, there is no evidence to indicate that reducing dietary CP levels to around 140 to 150 g CP/kg DM will have any detrimental effect on either cow fertility or health. Contemporary models that estimate MP requirements of dairy cows may require refinement and further validation in order to predict responses with low CP diets.},

DESIGN: Standardized, systematic evaluation of the literature, categorization of relevant articles according to level of evidence and quality, and development of consensus on conclusions for application of the concepts to clinical post-cardiac arrest care. SETTING: Academia, referral practice, and general practice. RESULTS: Fifteen standardized clinical questions important for post-cardiac arrest care were asked and research articles relevant to answering these questions were identified through structured, explicit literature database searches. The majority of these articles report research in species other than dogs or cats or consisted of experimental work in canine cardiac arrest models. Outcome metrics reported in these studies widely varied and ranged from quantification of mechanistic endpoints, such as elaboration of reactive oxygen species, to survival, and functional neurologic outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the near complete absence of clinical veterinary studies, the process allowed the formulation of statements for several postcardiac arrest treatments that were either supportive, such as mild therapeutic hypothermia or controlled reoxygenation, or neutral, such as for mannitol administration or seizure prophylaxis. Evidence grading allowed transparency in regards to the strength of these recommendations. Moreover, numerous knowledge gaps emerged that will allow generation of a road map for progress in veterinary post-cardiac arrest care.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines in reducing faecal shedding of Escherichia coli O157 in ruminants. A systematic search of eight databases and land-grant university research reports using an algorithm adapted from a previous systematic review of pre-harvest interventions against E. coli O157 was conducted to locate all reports of in vivo trials of E. coli O157 vaccines in ruminants published between 1990 and 2010. All located references were screened by two independent reviewers, and data were extracted from all relevant papers, with treatment effect measured in odds ratios. For trials with a faecal prevalence outcome that did not involve mixing of treated and untreated cattle in the same pen, efficacy was explored using random-effects meta-analysis. Funnel plots were used to evaluate publication bias, and random-effects meta-regression was performed to explore heterogeneity. The search located 20 relevant manuscripts which detailed 24 trials and 46 treatment comparisons; all but one trial involved cattle. There were 9 deliberate challenge trials (19 comparisons), and 15 natural exposure trials (27 comparisons). For Type III protein vaccines, there were 9 natural exposure trials detailing 17 comparisons, and meta-analysis of 8 comparisons revealed that vaccine treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in E. coli O157 faecal prevalence [odds ratio (OR)=0.38, 95\% confidence interval (CI)=0.29, 0.51]. Siderophore receptor and porin protein (SRP) vaccines (three trials/four comparisons) also reduced faecal prevalence (OR=0.42, 95\% CI=0.20, 0.61); however, none of the bacterin vaccine trials (n=3, six comparisons) resulted in a statistically significant reduction in prevalence. The results suggest that Type III protein and SRP vaccines significantly reduce faecal shedding in cattle; however, caution should be taken in interpreting the results because of the heterogeneity in the results.},

	abstract = {The aim of this systematic review was to collect data concerning the effects of diets containing GM maize, potato, soybean, rice, or triticale on animal health. We examined 12 long-term studies (of more than 90 days, up to 2 years in duration) and 12 multigenerational studies (from 2 to 5 generations). We referenced the 90-day studies on GM feed for which long-term or multigenerational study data were available. Many parameters have been examined using biochemical analyses, histological examination of specific organs, hematology and the detection of transgenic DNA. The statistical findings and methods have been considered from each study. Results from all the 24 studies do not suggest any health hazards and, in general, there were no statistically significant differences within parameters observed. However, some small differences were observed, though these fell within the normal variation range of the considered parameter and thus had no biological or toxicological significance. If required, a 90-day feeding study performed in rodents, according to the OECD Test Guideline, is generally considered sufficient in order to evaluate the health effects of GM feed. The studies reviewed present evidence to show that GM plants are nutritionally equivalent to their non-GM counterparts and can be safely used in food and feed.},

Vaccine types were grouped into 11 or 10 categories based on the subunit content in each preparation for the first and second analysis, respectively. The least-squares means of the postchallenge lung-lesion scores of each vaccine type were then compared after controlling for all the other variables in an analysis of variance using Fischer's protected least significant difference. The statistical analysis was done using a general linear models procedure. Protective indices for each vaccine type were calculated as a function of independent probabilities of protection among vaccinates and controls, and were then compared in a similar model. Cattle vaccinated with live vaccines had the smallest lung-lesion scores (9+or-8) which significantly differed from that of controls (44+or-8), bacterins (23+or-6) and live streptomycin dependent (Sm[super:D], 38+or-12) or modified live (31+or-10). KSCN extract (9+or-10), bacterin, and culture supernatant (CS, 20+or-9) also had significantly lower lung-lesion scores compared to controls. The CS and KSCN vaccines showed a significantly better protective index (PI, 0.70 and 0.68, respectively) than bacterins (0.50) or bacterin + CS (0.44) vaccines. Saline extract and live vaccines had better PI (0.60 and 0.70, respectively) compared to bacterins.},

Design-Meta-analysis. Sample-26 studies published in peer-reviewed journals or reviewed by a regulatory agency. Procedures-To be included, a study had to involve the use of the rbST-Zn formulation available to US producers in accordance with the label instructions for treatment initiation (57 to 70 days postpartum), dose (500 mg, q 14 d), and route (SC). Results-For cows treated with rbST-Zn, mean milk, 3.5\% fat-corrected milk, fat, and protein yields were increased by 4.00, 4.04, 0.144, and 0.137 kg/d (8.8, 8.89, 0.32, and 0.30 lb/d), respectively; however, the concentration of milk components did not change. Pregnancy proportion for the first 2 breeding cycles was increased by 5.4\%, and pregnancy proportion for the duration of the trial was reduced by 5.5\% for rbST-Zn-treated cows, compared with proportions for untreated cows. Mean body condition score (1 to 5 scale) was reduced by 0.06 points during the period of rbST-Zn use for treated cows. Administration of rbST-Zn had no effect on milk somatic cell count, the number of days to pregnancy, or inseminations per pregnancy; rates of fetal loss, twins, cystic ovaries, clinical lameness, lameness lesions, or traumatic lesions of the integumentary system; and odds of clinical mastitis or culling. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results indicated that rbST-Zn administration to dairy cows effectively increases milk production with no adverse effects on cow health and well-being.},

Furthermore, German journals were surveyed for relevant papers. RESULTS: A total of 16 publications concerning the subject were found: ten expert opinions, three case series and three cohort studies. CONCLUSION: Publications on "coat changes in castrated bitches" are rare. The contemporary literature is predominantly comprised of expert opinions and is therefore of little evidentiary value. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Because coat changes following spaying in bitches are often described, dog owners should be informed about these possible secondary effects after spaying. Analysis of frequency and promotive factors with high evidentiary value are still lacking. Consequently, it is difficult or impossible to predict the individual risk of a dog developing coat changes.},

Treatment duration varied from 2 weeks to 6 months. For safety analysis, data were available from 660 dogs. Lesion scores were improved from baseline in the range of 30-52\%, 53-84\% and 52-69\% after 4, 6 and 16 weeks, respectively. The percentage of dogs with only mild pruritus rose from 0-13\% at inclusion to 32-59\% and 46-90\% after 4 and 12 weeks, respectively. In most studies, the frequency of CsA administration could be reduced to every other day in 40\% to 50\% of patients after 4 weeks and to twice weekly in 20-26\% of the dogs after 12-16 weeks. Meta-analysis confirmed highly significant effects of CsA compared to placebo, but none between oral CsA and glucocorticoids. The initial disease severity, age or body weight of subjects did not influence treatment success. Improvement by more than 50\% over baseline of lesion scores was predictive of a better response during treatment maintenance. Vomiting and soft stools/diarrhoea were the most frequent adverse events seen at least once during the studies. These occurred in 25\% and 15\% of subjects, respectively. The frequency of each other type of adverse events was lower than 2.1\%. In summary, the administration of CsA for the treatment of canine AD was found to be as effective as that of glucocorticoids, and adverse effects were minimal.},

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of furosemide to reduce the severity or frequency of detection of EIPH in Thoroughbred racehorses. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review with meta-analysis. METHODS: Primary studies were identified via searches of electronic databases, relevant texts and reference lists of published articles. Studies were not restricted by date or publication status. Only studies published in English were eligible for inclusion. Searches were performed using a predetermined search string. Randomised controlled trials and non randomised trials were included. Three authors independently assessed each study using the Cochrane collaboration guidelines and GRADE recommendations of rating quality of evidence. Meta-analysis of studies was performed with pooled data to determine if furosemide reduced the frequency of detection of EIPH (yes or no) as evaluated by tracheobronchoscopy or bronchoalveolar RBC number, or if furosemide reduced the severity of EIPH by at least one tracheobronchoscopic grade. RESULTS: Seventeen studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The relative risk (RR) of detecting any EIPH by tracheobronchoscopy after administration of furosemide was 0.88 (pooled data from 11 studies, n = 5780; 95\% CI 0.79 – 0.97, p = 0.01). When data from only high quality RCTs (2 studies, n = 405) were used, the RR of detecting endoscopically evident EIPH was 0.69 (95\% CI 0.61 – 0.76, p{\textless}0.001). The proportion of horses previously diagnosed with EIPH having a reduction of at least one EIPH grade after furosemide was 0.68 (2 studies, n = 405; 95\% CI 61 – 76\%). CONCLUSIONS: There is high quality evidence, albeit limited, that administration of furosemide reduces the incidence and severity of EIPH in Thoroughbred or Standardbred racehorses.},

METHOD: Electronic searches of PubMed, MEDLINE and CAB Direct were carried out (25 May 2011) without date or language restrictions. Proceedings of ESVD/ECVD, AAVD/ACVD, NAVDF and WCVD annual congresses were searched. Unpublished studies were sought via the Veterinary Dermatology discussion list and Veterinary Information Network. RESULTS: Seventeen full-length, peer-reviewed controlled trials reporting clinical outcomes of systemic antimicrobial treatment for canine pyoderma were identified. Outcomes specific to superficial or deep pyoderma were reported in nine and five studies, respectively. Five studies reported outcomes only for nondifferentiated pyoderma depth. Heterogeneity of study designs and outcome measures made meta-analysis inappropriate. A good level of evidence was identified supporting the high efficacy of subcutaneously injected cefovecin in superficial pyoderma and for oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in deep pyoderma. A fair level of evidence was identified for moderate to high efficacy of oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clindamycin, cefadroxil, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole and sulfadimethoxine-ormetoprim in superficial pyoderma and oral pradofloxacin, oral cefadroxil and subcutaneously injected cefovecin in deep pyoderma. Eleven trials reported observations of adverse effects in treated pyoderma cases by intervention group; four dogs were withdrawn owing to the severity of adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for greater numbers of adequately sized, blinded, randomized controlled trials evaluating systemic antimicrobial interventions for canine pyoderma. Improved differentiation between superficial and deep pyoderma in outcome reporting, outcome measure standardization and association of outcomes with causative bacterial species and their resistance patterns are required.},

Meta-analysis of the results from different publications rather than a narrative review may provide a current status of this technology in buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). In order to gain an idea of the factors affecting the IVF in buffalo, a review of the various studies conducted on buffalo IVF and a meta-analysis of their findings was undertaken. More than 100 articles published from 1991 to 2008 were searched, and results were subjected to meta-analysis to determine the treatment variations without any bias. Thirty factors affecting in vitro embryo production in buffalo were considered. Initially, both fixed- and random-effect models were used. We did not observe any heterogeneity between the studies. Thereafter, all the studies were pooled using the fixed-effect model for analysis. Our analysis suggested that good buffalo oocytes with more than three to five cumulus layers recovered from large-sized follicles in cold seasons when cultured in TCM-199 supplemented with serum, follicle-stimulating hormone, and cysteamine resulted in maximum maturation rate and subsequent embryonic development after insemination. The values obtained in the current study may be considered for a simulation model in establishing a cost-effective suitable method for buffalo IVF in further planned research.},

	abstract = {The zoo scientific community was among the first to focus attention on captivity-induced stereotypic behaviors, their causes, and methods of eradication. Environmental enrichment has emerged recently as the main husbandry tool for tackling this problem. An increasing number of research publications have attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of enrichment in reducing stereotypic behavior and to develop further concepts to explain how effective enrichment works. A review and meta-analysis of this literature indicates that enrichment is a successful technique for reducing stereotypic behavior in zoo animals. Enrichment was associated with significant reduction in stereotypy performance about 53\% of the time. Published enrichment and stereotypy research is lacking for most zoo species, with most studies on large, charismatic, and often endangered species, but it is unclear whether stereotypies are more prevalent in these species. In addition, problems with scientific methods and data presentation, quantitatively detailed in this work, severely limit the conclusions drawn from zoo research. Further understanding of what kinds of enrichment works and what doesn't will require greater attention to experimental design, sample size, statistical analysis, and better descriptions of enrichment properties and the form of stereotypy. We recommend that future studies focus on increasing sample size (e.g., through multi-institutional studies), appropriate repeated measures design (e.g., with multiple baseline and experimental phases), providing full statistical information about the behavioral changes observed (including standard error), and ultimately the development of a predictive science for enrichment, stereotypies, and wellbeing.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment of dogs with primary immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) is difficult and frequently unrewarding. Prognostic factors have been evaluated in a number of previous studies, and identification of such factors would be beneficial to enable selection of appropriate therapeutic regimens and supportive care. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the current study was to undertake a critical appraisal of the risk of bias in evidence relating to prognostic indicators for mortality in dogs with IMHA. ANIMALS: Three hundred and eighty client-owned dogs with spontaneous primary idiopathic IMHA reported in 6 previous studies. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to evaluate evidence relating to prognostic factors for mortality in dogs with primary IMHA. Search tools were employed to identify articles and a validated appraisal tool was used to assess the quality of individual studies by considering inclusion and exclusion criteria, measurement of prognostic, outcome and confounding variables, and statistical methods. RESULTS: Few studies evaluated prognostic indicators for IMHA in dogs, and all of these suffered from methodologic flaws in at least 1 major area. Fifteen different variables were identified as prognostic indicators, with 2 variables identified by {\textgreater}1 study. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: There are few pieces of high-quality evidence available to enable estimation of prognosis for dogs presenting with primary IMHA.},

There is much evidence regarding prevalence of Leishmania RNAvirus (LRV) causing Old World leishmaniasis (OWL) and New World leishmaniasis (NWL); however, a combined evidence-based knowledge on this topic is not still available. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to address the global status of synchronizing LRV in Leishmania in the available literature. The data were systematically collected from the English electronic databases up to May 2018. Then, the studies were screened based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The random-effect model was used by forest plot with 95\% confidence interval (CI). Overall, 877 samples from 17 articles were included in this study. Given species of Leishmania, the highest prevalence of LRV belonged to Leishmania (L.) Viannia (V.) guyanensis and L. V. braziliensis. Additionally, the virus was detected also in L. V. amazonensis, L. V. panamanensis, L. V. lainsoni, L. aethiopica, L. major and L. infantum. By random-effect model, the global prevalence of LRV was estimated to be 26.2\% (95\% CI: 14.4\% - 40.1\%). The high prevalence of LRV among causative agents of NWLisolated from the metastatic clinical forms suggests potential association of LRV with metastatic clinical forms in New World endemic regions. A comprehensive investigation on experimental and clinical aspects of LRV is needed to fully appraise the role of these viruses in pathogenicity of Leishmania parasites and their drug resistance.},

This study aims to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the data on the prevalence of Naegleria spp. in water sources in the available literature. Included articles on the prevalence of Naegleria spp. in water sources in PubMed, Google Scholar, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, EMBASE, Scopus and Web of Science were systematically searched between January 1977 and September 2019. Regarding meta-analysis, the random-effect model was employed by forest plot with 95\% of confidence interval (CI). The meta-analysis considered 103 articles surveying the prevalence of Naegleria spp. in various water sources. The pooled worldwide prevalence of Naegleria spp. across 35 countries was 26.42\% (95\% CI = 21.52-31.63). The subgroup analysis reported that the pooled worldwide prevalence of N. fowleri is 23.27\%, N. australiensis 9.12\%, N. lovaniensis 7.68\%, N. pagei 5.95, N. polaris 5.17\%, N. gruberi 3.95\%, N. clarki 3.54\%, N. americana 3.19\%, N. philippinensis 1.99\% and N. dobsoni 1.73\%. This is the first systematic review on the prevalence of Naegleria spp. in water sources. Our findings suggest a wide distribution of Naegleria spp., including potential pathogenic species such as N. fowleri, in water sources all over the world. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to provide comprehensive data and systematic analysis regarding the prevalence of Naegleria spp. in water sources. Accordingly, further studies are highly recommended to investigate the presence of pathogenic N. fowleri in other countries.},

	doi = {10.7717/peerj.6260},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing human population and global intensification of agriculture have had a major impact on the world's natural ecosystems and caused devastating effects on populations of mega-herbivores such as the African savanna elephants, through habitat reduction and fragmentation and increased human-animal conflict. Animals with vast home ranges are forced into increasingly smaller geographical areas, often restricted by fencing or encroaching anthropogenic activities, resulting in huge pressures on these areas to meet the animals' resource needs. This can present a nutritional challenge and cause animals to adapt their movement patterns to meet their dietary needs for specific minerals, potentially causing human-animal conflict. The aim of this review is to consolidate understanding of nutritional drivers for animal movement, especially that of African savanna elephants and focus the direction of future research. Peer reviewed literature available was generally geographically specific and studies conducted on isolated populations of individual species. African savanna elephants have the capacity to extensively alter the landscape and have been more greatly studied than other herbivores, making them a good example species to use for this review. Alongside this, their movement choices, potentially linked with nutritional drivers could be applicable to a range of other species. Relevant case study examples of other herbivores moving based on nutritional needs are discussed. METHODS: Three databases were searched in this review: Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar, using identified search terms. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were determined and applied as required. Additional grey literature was reviewed as appropriate. RESULTS: Initial searches yielded 1,870 records prior to application of inclusion and exclusion criteria. A less detailed review of grey literature, and additional peer-reviewed literature which did not meet the inclusion criteria but was deemed relevant by the authors was also conducted to ensure thorough coverage of the subject. DISCUSSION: A review of peer reviewed literature was undertaken to examine nutritional drivers for African elephant movement, exploring documented examples from free-ranging African savanna elephants and, where relevant, other herbivore species. This could help inform prediction or mitigation of human-elephant conflict, potentially when animals move according to nutritional needs, and related drivers for this movement. In addition, appropriate grey literature was included to capture current research.},

	abstract = {Background: Worldwide, horses play critical roles in recreation, food production, transportation, and as working animals. Horses' roles differ by geographical region and the socioeconomic status of the people, but despite modern advances in transportation, which have in some ways altered humans contact with horses, potential risks for equine zoonotic pathogen transmission to humans occur globally. While previous reports have focused upon individual or groups of equine pathogens, to our knowledge, a systematic review of equine zoonoses has never been performed. Methods: Using PRISMA's systematic review guidelines, we searched the English literature and identified 233 previous reports of potential equine zoonoses found in horses. We studied and summarized their findings with a goal of identifying risk factors that favor disease transmission from horses to humans. Results: These previous reports identified 56 zoonotic pathogens that have been found in horses. Of the 233 articles, 13 involved direct transmission to humans (5.6\%).The main potential routes of transmission included oral, inhalation, and cutaneous exposures. Pathogens most often manifest in humans through systemic, gastrointestinal, and dermatological signs and symptoms. Furthermore, 16.1\% were classified as emerging infectious diseases and thus may be less known to both the equine and human medical community. Sometimes, these infections were severe leading to human and equine death. Conclusions: While case reports of zoonotic infections directly from horses remain low, there is a high potential for underreporting due to lack of knowledge among health professionals. Awareness of these zoonotic pathogens, their disease presentation in horses and humans, and their associated risk factors for cross-species infection are important to public health officials, clinicians, and people with recreational or occupational equid exposure.},

The present review aimed to summarize the current evidence on the association of fish consumption and dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs with hip fracture. The online databases of PubMed, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, ProQuest, Science Direct and Embase were searched until August 2017 for related publications using relevant keywords. To pool data, either a fixed-effects model or random-effects models were used. Cochran's Q tests were used to assess heterogeneity between studies. In total, 10 studies (7 prospective and 3 case-control studies) were included in this systematic review, and 9 studies with total sample size of 292657 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The age of participants was 20 years or older. Combining 8 effect sizes from 4 prospective studies and 2 case-control studies revealed a significant inverse association between fish consumption and risk of hip fracture (pooled effect size: 0.88, 95\% CI: 0.79-0.98, P = 0.02). Although this relationship became non-significant in prospective studies, a significant inverse association was found in prospective studies with sample size of 10000 individuals or more, and studies that considered body mass index as a covariate. Furthermore, dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs was inversely associated with risk of hip fracture (pooled effect size: 0.89, 95\% CI: 0.80-0.99, P = 0.02). Also, such relationship was seen after excluding one case-control study and combining effect sizes only from prospective studies (pooled effect size: 0.88, 95\% CI: 0.80-0.98, P = 0.02). In conclusion, we found that fish consumption and dietary intake of n-3 PUFAs might have protective effects on bone health and decline the risk of hip fracture.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Human and bovine colostrum (HBC) administration has been linked to beneficial effects on morbidity and mortality associated with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and safety of HBC for reducing NEC, mortality, sepsis, time to full-feed and feeding intolerance in preterm infants. DATA SOURCES: We conducted searches through Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and gray literature. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials comparing human or bovine colostrum to placebo. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently did screening, review, and extraction. RESULTS: Eight studies (385 infants) proved eligible. In comparison with placebo, HBC revealed no effect on the incidence of severe NEC (relative risk [RR]: 0.99; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.48 to 2.02, I(2) = 2.2\%; moderate certainty of evidence), all-cause mortality (RR: 0.88; 95\% CI 0.39 to 1.82, I(2) = 0\%; moderate certainty), culture-proven sepsis (RR: 0.78; 95\% CI 0.53 to 1.14, I(2) = 0\%; moderate certainty), and feed intolerance (RR: 0.97; 95\% CI 0.37 to 2.56, I(2) = 55\%; low certainty). HBC revealed a significant effect on reducing the mean days to reach full enteral feed (mean difference: -3.55; 95\% CI 0.33 to 6.77, I(2) = 41.1\%; moderate certainty). The indirect comparison of bovine versus human colostrum revealed no difference in any outcome. LIMITATIONS: The number of patients was modest, whereas the number of NEC-related events was low. CONCLUSIONS: Bovine or human colostrum has no effect on severe NEC, mortality, culture-proven sepsis, feed intolerance, or length of stay. Additional research focused on the impact on enteral feeding may be needed to confirm the findings on this outcome.},

	abstract = {Lameness resulting from claw lesions remains a pressing welfare issue in dairy cows. Claw trimming (CT) is a common practice for prevention and management of clinically lame cows. This review summarizes the results of studies that have investigated various claw trimming (CT) methods, their application in lameness management, and associations with the welfare and production of dairy cows. The papers included in this review fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: published in peer review journal or book chapter within the last 20 years (1999-2019), written in English, and focused on the application of CT for lameness management and the association with either welfare or production variables. Databases used included Google scholar, Web of Science and PubMed. A total of 748 records were assessed and 61 papers were eligible for inclusion and the main objectives and results were used to categorize the results under six topics: CT techniques, association between CT and claw overgrowth/specific claw lesions, timing and frequency of CT, association between CT and behavioral variables, association between CT and physiological parameters, and association between CT and production. The literature findings showed the existence of various CT methods with the common types including the Dutch Five-step, White Line, White Line Atlas, and Kansas techniques. There is data paucity on the efficacy of these techniques in lameness management; however, the slight procedural difference yields varying sole thicknesses and presentations which may influence their prophylactic use. Results regarding the impact of CT on welfare and production were discussed in relation to potential short and long-term benefits. Depending on the lesion type and severity level, CT may induce immediate painful sensation, stress, changes in lying down activities and reduction in milk yield, but the positive impacts were more evident at later stages of lactation following improvement in locomotion score. The majority of the reviewed studies were lacking a detailed description of CT techniques and claw health of the studied animals; thus, reducing the strength of demonstrating CT-related benefits. However, electronic recording of claw health data during every CT visit provides the basis for monitoring hoof health and could assist in curtailing some of these challenges. To elucidate CT-related benefits, certain areas requiring further research were highlighted such as ascertaining the appropriate timing for preventive CT and identifying cows that will benefit more from such intervention during lactation.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Equine gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) have been the subject of intermittent studies in Australia over the past few decades. However, comprehensive information on the epidemiology of equine GINs, the efficacy of available anthelmintic drugs and the prevalence of anthelmintic resistance (AR) in Australasia is lacking. Herein, we have systematically reviewed existing knowledge on the horse GINs recorded in Australia, and main aspects of their pathogeneses, epidemiology, diagnoses, treatment and control. METHODS: Six electronic databases were searched for publications on GINs of Australian horses that met our inclusion criteria for the systematic review. Subsets of publications were subjected to review epidemiology, diagnoses, pathogeneses, treatment and control of GINs of horses from Australia. RESULTS: A total of 51 articles published between 1950 to 2018 were included. The main GINs reported in Australian horses were cyathostomins (at least 28 species), Draschia megastoma, Habronema muscae, H. majus, Oxyuris equi, Parascaris equorum, Strongyloides westeri and Trichostrongylus axei across different climatic regions of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and Western Australia. Nematodes are diagnosed based on the traditional McMaster egg counting technique, though molecular markers to characterise common GINs of equines were characterised in 1990s. The use of anthelmintic drugs remains the most widely-used strategy for controlling equine GIN parasites in Australia; however, the threshold of faecal egg count that should trigger treatment in horses, remains controversial. Furthermore, anthelmintic resistance within GIN population of horses is becoming a common problem in Australia. CONCLUSIONS: Although GINs infecting Australian horses have been the subject of occasional studies over the past few decades, the effective control of GIN infections is hampered by a generalised lack of knowledge in various disciplines of equine parasitology. Therefore, coordinated and focused research is required to fill our knowledge gaps in these areas to maximise equine health and minimise economic losses associated with the parasitic infections in Australia.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Antimony (Sb) trioxide and antimony trisulfide are "2B: Possibly carcinogenic to humans" and "3: Unclassifiable" according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The U.S. National Toxicology Program (NTP) concluded that antimony trioxide "is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on studies in rats and mice". We investigated the cancer hazard of antimony compounds for workers, a population with high exposure to antimony substances. METHODS: Using the "Guidelines for performing systematic reviews in the development of toxicity factors" (Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) 2017) as a guidance, we established a human and an animal toxicology data stream in Medline and ToxLine. Data from this review were applied in a human health risk assessment. RESULTS: A final pool of 10 occupational and 13 animal toxicology articles resulted after application of TCEQ guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Antimony carcinogenicity evidence involving workers is inadequate, based on confounding, small sample sizes, incomparability across studies, and inadequate reference populations. An increased lung cancer risk cannot be excluded. Evidence for lung neoplasms caused by antimony trioxide inhalation in experimental animals is sufficient. Overall, carcinogenicity in workers is probable (International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) 2A). It remains unclear from what occupational exposure duration and dose this effect arises and whether exposure threshold values should be reconsidered.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Decreases in clinical response of Clostridioides difficile to antibiotics used for its treatment have raised concerns regarding antibiotic resistance. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to study the resistance rates of C. difficile to various antibiotics over time. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science from inception through 03/31/2017 for observational studies assessing antibiotic resistance rates in C. difficile. Weighted summary estimates were calculated using inverse variance heterogeneity models [MetaXL software (v. 5.3)]. A priori subgroup analyses were done (by study year, continent, susceptibility testing method, origin of isolates); ribotype 027 strains were analyzed separately. RESULTS: From 1982 to 2017, 60 studies (8336 isolates) were analyzed. Fifty-three studies reported vancomycin resistance; weighted pooled resistance (WPR), 2.1\% (95\% CI, 0\%-5.1\%; I(2) = 95\%). Fifty-five studies reported metronidazole resistance; WPR, 1.9\% (95\% CI, 0.5\%-3.6\%; I(2) = 89\%). Compared to the period before 2012, vancomycin resistance increased by 3.6\% (95\% CI, 2.9\%-4.2\%; P {\textless} 0.001) after 2012, and metronidazole resistance decreased by 0.8\% (95\% CI, 0.1\%-1.5\%; P = 0.02). No isolates were resistant to fidaxomicin. CONCLUSION: Resistance of C. difficile to vancomycin is increasing, with a smaller, declining resistance to metronidazole; there is significant heterogeneity between studies. Ongoing monitoring of resistance to commonly used antibiotics is required.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is an increasing global health problem, but its treatment is not yet optimal, especially in the long term. For this reason, preclinical studies have been conducted relating to a new therapeutic strategy for obesity based on adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs). The aim of our systematic review is to summarize these findings deriving from the animal model in order to establish whether there is sufficient evidence to justify going forward to clinical studies. METHODS: Literature searches, study selection, methods and quality appraisal were performed as per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data were collated using a narrative approach. RESULTS: Of the 578 articles retrieved, seven studies met the inclusion criteria, and their analysis revealed several main findings. There was a strong evidence of the positive effect of AD-MSCs in obesity treatment in terms of body weight, glucose metabolism homeostasis, lipid profiles, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and systemic inflammation. Moreover, there was recent evidence from a few studies for a significant effect of AD-MSCs transplantation on the improvement of obesity-related hormonal status, (i.e., leptin) and body composition patterns, though these investigations may need further replication. CONCLUSION: The effects of AD-MSCs transplantation on obesity, in terms of weight loss and obesityrelated diseases, are promising in animal models. In the future, further well-designed studies should be performed to understand the mechanism of action and to overcome some methodological limitations such as the small sample sizes and risk of bias evidenced in our systematic review, before moving forward to assess AD-MSCs as a potential strategy for human obesity management.},

We searched four electronic databases till April 2018 using relevant keywords. All English language articles were assessed. For animal studies, standardized mean difference was pooled using a random effects model. The included studies were evaluated for eligibility and risk of bias. Thirty-nine articles (two human, 23 animal, and 14 in vitro studies) were reviewed. The results of in vitro systems supported the antioxidant effect of artichoke, whereas limited clinical trials indicated no change or a slight improvement of antioxidant status. Finding of animal studies indicated that artichoke extract supplementation increased superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, and glutathione peroxidase level in liver, as well as, decreased malondialdehyde level in liver and plasma of animals with induced disease significantly compared with comparison group. This meta-analysis provided convincing evidence for antioxidant activity of artichoke in animals.},

Part of the AMR dimension is the circulation of extended-spectrum β-lactamases producing-Escherichia coli (ESBL-E. coli), which is now commonly reported among companion animals. However, the global perspective of the prevalence and population structure of ESBL-E. coli circulating in dogs and cats has not been estimated limiting our understanding of their role in the dissemination of ESBL-E. coli. The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of ESBL-E. coli between dogs and cats and across countries through meta-analysis. We also performed a scoping review to summarize the current knowledge on ESBL genes and E. coli clones circulating among companion animals. A total of 128 studies published in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus up to April 2020 were selected and contained information on prevalence and/or molecular characterization of ESBL genes and ESBL-E. coli clones. Our review shows an increase in the number of publications between 2000 and 2019, concentrated mainly in Europe. Prevalence varied across continents, ranging from 0.63\% (Oceania) to 16.56\% (Africa) in dogs and from 0\% (Oceania) to 16.82\% (Asia) in cats. Although there were twice as many studies reporting prevalence on dogs (n = 61) than on cats (n = 32), and only 9 studies focused exclusively on cats, our meta-analysis showed no difference in the global prevalence of ESBL-E. coli between dogs (6.87\% [95\% CI: 4.46-10.45\%]) and cats (5.04\% [95\% CI: 2.42-10.22\%]). A considerable diversity of ESBL genes (n = 60) and sequence types (ST) (n = 171) were recovered from companion animals. ESBL-E. coli encoded by CTX-M-15 (67.5\%, 77/114) and SHV-12 (21.9\%, 25/114), along with resistant strains of ST38 (22.7\%, 15/66) and ST131 (50\%, 33/66) were widespread and detected in all continents. While presence of ESBL-E. coli is widespread, the drivers influencing the observed ESBL-E. coli prevalence and the clinical relevance in veterinary medicine and public health along with economic impact of ESBL-E. coli infections among companion animals need to be further investigated.},

	abstract = {AIMS: Although chemotherapeutic agents have highly beneficial effects against cancer, they disturb the body's normal homeostasis. One of the critical side effects of chemotherapeutic agents is their deleterious effect on the cardiac system, which causes limitations of their clinical usage. Taurine constitutes more than 50\% of the amino acids in the heart. The use of taurine might prevent chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity. This systematic study aims to evaluate the protective role of taurine against cardiotoxicity induced by chemotherapy. METHODS: A systematic search was performed in databases up to November 2020, and the review is designed on PRISMA guidelines. The search keywords were selected based on our study target and were searched in the title and abstract. After the consecutive screening, out of a whole of 94 articles, 8 articles were included according to our inclusion and exclusion criteria. KEY FINDINGS: According to the study results, chemotherapy decreases body and heart weight and increases mortality. Also, it induces some biochemical and histological changes compared to the control group. By co-administration of taurine with chemotherapy, alterations returned near to the average level. These protective effects of taurine are mediated through anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties. SIGNIFICANCE: Based on evaluated non-clinical studies, taurine ameliorates chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity, but its possible interaction with the efficacy of anti-cancer medicines that mostly act through induction of oxidants remains to be elucidated in the future. This needs conducting well-designed studies to assess the effectiveness and safety of this combination simultaneously.},

	abstract = {Body condition metrics are widely used to infer animal health and to assess costs of parasite infection. Since parasites harm their hosts, ecologists might expect negative relationships between infection and condition in wildlife, but this assumption is challenged by studies showing positive or null condition-infection relationships. Here, we outline common condition metrics used by ecologists in studies of parasitism, and consider mechanisms that cause negative, positive, and null condition-infection relationships in wildlife systems. We then perform a meta-analysis of 553 condition-infection relationships from 187 peer-reviewed studies of animal hosts, analysing observational and experimental records separately, and noting whether authors measured binary infection status or intensity. Our analysis finds substantial heterogeneity in the strength and direction of condition-infection relationships, a small, negative average effect size that is stronger in experimental studies, and evidence for publication bias towards negative relationships. The strongest predictors of variation in study outcomes are host thermoregulation and the methods used to evaluate body condition. We recommend that studies aiming to assess parasite impacts on body condition should consider host-parasite biology, choose condition measures that can change during the course of infection, and employ longitudinal surveys or manipulate infection status when feasible.},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted to compare the effects of feeding dairy cows conventional sorghum silage (CSS) or conventional corn silage (CCS) compared with brown midrib sorghum silage (BMRSS) diets on dry matter intake (DMI), milk production, and milk composition. Data from 9 published articles (1984 to 2015) were used to contrast diets with CSS (7 means comparisons; 104 cows) or CCS (13 means comparisons; 204 cows) versus BMRSS diets. Statistical analysis was performed using fixed or random effects models with the Metafor package of R (https://www.R-project.org). The degree of heterogeneity was measured with the I(2) statistic, and publication bias was determined with funnel plots and Egger's regression test. Other sources of heterogeneity of response were analyzed through meta-regression. Estimated effect size was calculated for DMI, milk production, and milk composition. No evidence of publication bias was observed for any variable tested. The highest degree of heterogeneity (I(2) = 41.5 and 72.6\%) was observed for DMI among dependent variables tested in both comparisons, indicating that intake responses to silage type are rather inconsistent; in contrast, milk production had the lowest degree of heterogeneity (I(2) = 0\%), supporting the idea that the responses of this variable to silage type were very consistent across studies. Compared with BMRSS diets, cows fed CSS diets exhibited decreased milk production (1.64 kg/d), milk fat concentration (0.09\%), milk fat yield (0.08 kg/d), milk protein yield (0.04 kg/d), and milk lactose yield (0.16 kg/d) and tended to decrease DMI (0.83 kg/d). Compared with CCS diets, cows fed BMRSS diets increased milk fat concentration (0.10\%), but decreased milk protein concentration (0.06\%) and tended to increase lactose yield (0.08 kg/d). Meta-regression indicated that days in milk affected DMI and milk production when CSS diets were compared with BMRSS diets, and DMI when CCS diets were compared with BMRSS diets. Additionally, the inclusion rate of silage in the diet and dietary neutral detergent fiber affected yields of milk fat and lactose, respectively, when CCS and BMRSS diets were compared. Overall, lactation performance improved when cows were fed diets formulated with BMRSS compared with CSS, but performance was not different for cows fed BMRSS and CCS diets. However, the small sample size may have influenced these results by increasing the margin of the error and, concurrently, the power of the meta-analysis. Results of this analysis suggest that additional research is needed to explore the effects of days in milk and the inclusion rates of silages in the diets when comparing BMRSS with CSS or CCS.},

	abstract = {One of the most critical threats to biodiversity is the high extinction rate driven by human activities. Reducing extinction rates requires the implementation of conservation programmes based on robust scientific data. Elasmobranchs are important ecological components of the ocean, and several species sustain substantial economic activities. Unfortunately, elasmobranchs are one of the most threatened and understudied animal taxa. The Mexican Pacific Coast (MPC) is a region with high elasmobranch diversity and is the seat of major elasmobranch fisheries. But it is also a developing region with several conservation and management challenges which require national and international attention. Here, we review the conservation genetics literature of elasmobranchs from the MPC. We present a synthesis of the works using samples from the region and emphasize the main gaps and biases in these data. In addition, we discuss the benefits and challenges of generating genomic information to improve the management and conservation of an elasmobranch biodiversity hotspot in a developing country. We found 47 elasmobranch genetic articles that cover {\textless}30\% of the elasmobranch diversity in the region. These studies mainly used mitochondrial DNA sequences to analyse the genetic structure of commercially important and abundant species of the order Carcharhiniformes. Some of these papers also assessed mating systems, demographic parameters, and taxonomic uncertainties, all of which are important topics for efficient management decisions. In terms of conservation genetics, elasmobranchs from the MPC remain understudied. However, high-throughput sequencing technologies have increased the power and accessibility of genomic tools, even in developing countries such as Mexico. The tools described here provide information relevant for biodiversity conservation. Therefore, we strongly suggest that investment in genomic research will assist implementation of efficient management strategies. In time, this will reduce the extinction risk of the unique elasmobranch biodiversity from the MPC.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: The integrity of the intestinal barrier in the diseased is key to prevent further complications and disease such as sepsis and death, whereas, the role of food bioactive molecules (i. e. phenolic compounds (PCs) on the intestinal barrier, is still unknown. The current aim was to explore the benefits of the oral PC administration on the intestinal barrier integrity in animals. METHODS: The effects of PCs on the intestinal barrier integrity in in vivo animal models of intestinal inflammation were assessed up-to August 2020 from the PubMed, SCOPUS, and Cochrane Library databases under the PRISMA methodology. The risk of bias was assessed from ARRAY and SCYRCLE tools. RESULTS: From 1241 articles, 14 studies were included. In animals, oral resveratrol (n = 6) improves the intestinal barrier integrity and reduces intestinal damage. Additionally, grape seed extract (n = 2), curcumin (n = 1), genistein (n = 1), chlorogenic acid (n = 1), grape pomace (n = 1), olive leaf (n = 1) or cranberry extract (n = 1) improve the intestinal barrier integrity downregulating various inflammatory molecules (TNF-α, and other interleukins), and increasing the antioxidant enzymes in animals. Furthermore, resveratrol, quercetin, epigallocatechin, and other PCs improve the epithelial barrier integrity and pro-inflammatory molecule expression in the intestinal epithelia. CONCLUSIONS: The oral PC administration in animals improves the intestinal barrier integrity and function from three main mechanisms: 1) The reduction of pro-inflammatory molecules, 2) the improvement in tight-junction protein expression, and 3) the improvement of the antioxidant intracellular activity suggesting the potential use of PCs in the management of intestinal injury in humans, particularly for resveratrol, the most studied PC.},

However, the association between circulating levels of BDNF and obesity is still not defined. To answer this question, we performed a meta-analysis carrying out a systematic search in electronic databases. Ten studies (307 obese patients and 236 controls) were included in the analysis. Our data show that obese patients have levels of BDNF similar to those of controls (SMD: 0.01, 95\% CI: -0.28, 0.30, p=0.94). The lack of difference was further confirmed both in studies in which BDNF levels were assessed in serum (MD: -0.93 ng/mL, 95\% CI: -3.34, 1.48, p=0.45) and in plasma (MD: 0.15 ng/mL, 95\% CI: -0.09, 0.39, p=0.23). Data evaluation has shown that some bias might affect BDNF measurements (e.g., subject recruitment, procedures of sampling, handling, and storage), leading to a difficult interpretation of the results. Standardization of the procedures is still needed to reach strong, affordable, and reliable conclusions.},

Several trials have assessed vaccine efficacy in livestock but there have been no attempts to evaluate these trials jointly. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate vaccine efficacy to prevent urinary shedding of Leptospira serovar Hardjo (Hardjo) in cattle. Three databases were used to search for relevant papers published from 1980 to 2015 evaluating commercial vaccines to prevent urinary shedding of leptospires after artificial conjunctival or natural challenge. A total of 1237 articles were initially identified. Eight articles containing information from nine trials that assessed vaccine efficacy to prevent Hardjo urinary shedding, as per bacteriological culture, were included in the meta-analysis. Fixed effects Mantel-Haenszel (MH) and a Bayesian random effects meta-analyses were used to estimate the efficacy of vaccination to prevent Hardjo shedding in urine. Vaccine efficacy against Hardjo challenge was 88.7\% (95\% CI 81.0\%-93.2\%) in the MH meta-analysis and 89.9\% (95\% probability interval 80.6\%-94.9\%) in the Bayesian random effects meta-analysis. There was no evidence of heterogeneity of study results (p = 0.17). The estimated vaccine efficacy to prevent urinary shedding of Hardjo in cattle may be sufficient to reduce disease incidence in animals and exposure risk of people working in close contact with cattle.},

	abstract = {AIMS: The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature for evidence of the effect of a high-fat diet (HFD) on the onset or progression of osteoarthritis (OA) in mice. METHODS: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus to find all studies on mice investigating the effects of HFD or Western-type diet on OA when compared with a control diet (CD). The primary outcome was the determination of cartilage loss and alteration. Secondary outcomes regarding local and systemic levels of proteins involved in inflammatory processes or cartilage metabolism were also examined when reported. RESULTS: In total, 14 publications met our inclusion criteria and were included in our review. Our meta-analysis showed that, when measured by the modified Mankin Histological-Histochemical Grading System, there was a significantly higher rate of OA in mice fed a HFD than in mice on a CD (standardized mean difference (SMD) 1.27, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 1.91). Using the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) score, there was a trend towards HFD causing OA (SMD 0.78, 95\% CI -0.04 to 1.61). In terms of OA progression, a HFD consistently worsened the progression of surgically induced OA when compared with a CD. Finally, numerous inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and leptin, among others, were found to be altered by a HFD. CONCLUSION: A HFD seems to induce or exacerbate the progression of OA in mice. The metabolic changes and systemic inflammation brought about by a HFD appear to be key players in the onset and progression of OA.Cite this article: Bone Joint Res 2019;8:582-592.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To systematically review and evaluate what is known regarding contemporary biological therapy capable of accelerating orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) in animal model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MedLine, Scopus, Web of Science and OpenGrey were searched without restrictions until June 2019. Following study retrieval and selection, relevant data was extracted using a standardized table. Risk of bias (RoB) assessment was performed using the Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation (SYRCLE) tool. RESULTS: Fifty-one animal studies were included. Two biological therapies were identified as capable of accelerating the OTM: chemical methods (49 studies) and gene therapy (2 studies). The main substances that increased the OTM rate were cytokines (13 studies), followed by growth factors (6 studies) and hormones (5 studies). Most studies were assessed to be at unclear or high RoB. The application protocols, measurement and reporting of outcomes varied widely and methodologies were not adequately reported. CONCLUSIONS: Although biological therapies to accelerate OTM have been widely tested and effective in preclinical studies, the validity of the evidence is flawed to support translational of these results. There is a need for well-designed experimental studies to translate these methods for clinical field.},

	abstract = {Biomarkers of antioxidant and biotransformation systems are commonly used to assess polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) pollution in fish. Despite their extensive application of biomarkers, contradictory results are vastly reported in the literature, even for the same species in similar contamination scenarios. This study aims to verify response patterns of biomarkers in fish exposed to PAHs. Through systematic reviews and meta-analyses, we were able to evaluate: (i) overall magnitude of PAHs effects on biotransformation and oxidative stress biomarkers; (ii) patterns of response among experimental approaches (laboratory, field and active biomonitoring), environment (marine and freshwater) and fish habitat (pelagic, demersal, etc.); (iii) effects of exposure route, time and concentration of PAHs; and (iv) which biomarkers respond best to PAHs exposure. Overall, biomarker responses were significantly affected by PAHs exposure. The activities of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and lipid peroxide (LPO) significantly increased in fish exposed to PAHs, whereas catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities and levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) were not affected. Amongst responsive biomarkers, EROD and GST activities significantly differed among approaches and between marine and freshwater environments, but were not affected by fish habitat. GSSG levels were higher in fish from laboratory bioassays compared to the field, but did not differ between environments nor habitats. Exposure route played a major role only for GST and GPx responses. Finally, increasing PAHs concentration and exposure time had a significant effect on all assessed biomarkers, except for CAT. We conclude that EROD and GST are robust biomarkers to assess PAHs effects in fish. Contrarily, CAT is an inadequate biomarker of PAHs exposure since no significant response was observed. Our study also highlighted some research gaps in PAHs contamination studies, such as a clear lack of active biomonitoring experiments.},

For many years, they have been a subject of interest in the international scientific community and are at the center of an important discussion regarding their effectiveness and the most appropriate practices for their realization. We carried out an umbrella review (UR) of systematic reviews (SRs), created for the purpose of exploring the literature and aimed at deepening the terminological and methodological aspects of AAIs. It is created by exploring the online databases PubMed, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library. The SRs present in the high-impact indexed search engines Web of Sciences and Scopus are selected. After screening, we selected 15 SRs that met the inclusion criteria. All papers complained of the poor quality of AAIs; some considered articles containing interventions that did not always correspond to the terminology they have explored and whose operating practices were not always comparable. This stresses the need for the development and consequent diffusion of not only operational protocols, but also research protocols which provide for the homogeneous use of universally recognized terminologies, thus facilitating the study, deepening, and comparison between the numerous experiences described.},

	abstract = {Animal-assisted interventions are widely implemented in different contexts worldwide. Particularly, animal-assisted therapies and animal-assisted activities are often implemented in hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and other health facilities. These interventions bring several benefits to patients but can also expose them to the risk of infection with potentially zoonotic agents. The dog is the main animal species involved used in these interventions. Therefore, we aimed at collecting data regarding the occurrence of the pathogens ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp.) in dogs, in order to draft guidelines concerning the possible monitoring of dogs involved in animal-assisted therapies and animal-assisted activities in healthcare facilities. We performed a literature search using the PRISMA guidelines to examine three databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Out of 2604 records found, 52 papers were identified as eligible for inclusion in the review/meta-analysis. Sixteen papers reported data on E. faecium; 16 on S. aureus; nine on K. pneumoniae; four on A. baumannii; eight on P. aeruginosa; and six on Enterobacter spp. This work will contribute to increased awareness to the potential zoonotic risks posed by the involvement of dogs in animal-assisted therapies, and animal-assisted activities in healthcare facilities.},

	doi = {10.3168/jds.2018-14628},
	abstract = {The objectives were to use meta-analytic methods to determine the effects of changes in dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) prepartum on productive performance and health of dairy cows. The literature was systematically reviewed, searching randomized experiments with transition cows that manipulated the prepartum DCAD or experiments with acidogenic diets in which dietary Ca, P, or Mg was manipulated. Forty-two experiments, including 134 treatment means and 1,803 cows, were included in the meta-analysis. Of those, 5 experiments with 15 treatment means reported responses for 151 nulliparous cows. Data collected included the mineral composition of prepartum diets, parity group prepartum, breed, days on treatment, and means and respective measure of variance for urine pH, dry matter intake (DMI), body weight, body condition, productive performance, concentrations of minerals and metabolites in blood, and incidence of diseases. Mixed effects meta-analyses were conducted weighting by the inverse of standard error of the means squared to account for the precision of each experiment. Models include the effects of DCAD, parity group prepartum, interaction between DCAD and parity group, and other covariates that showed significance in univariable analysis. Final models were selected based on parsimony and model fit. Reducing the prepartum DCAD reduced intake prepartum but improved intake postpartum in both parity groups. Interactions between DCAD and parity group occurred for yields of milk, fat-corrected milk (FCM), fat, and protein because reducing the DCAD improved those responses in parous cows; however, reducing the DCAD either had no effect on yields of milk and protein or reduced the yield of FCM and fat in nulliparous cows. The resulting equations from the statistical models predicted that reducing the DCAD from +200 to -100 mEq/kg would increase blood total Ca on the day of calving from 1.86 to 2.04 ± 0.05 mM, DMI postpartum 1.0 kg/d, and milk yield 1.7 kg/d in parous cows. The increased concentrations of blood total Ca at calving and postpartum explained the marked reduction in risk of milk fever in parous cows with a reduction in DCAD. As the DCAD decreased, the risk of retained placenta and metritis also decreased, resulting in fewer disease events per cow in both nulliparous and parous cows. Dietary concentrations of Ca, P, or Mg prepartum had no effect on DMI or yields of milk and FCM; however, increasing dietary Ca within the study range of 0.16 to 1.98\% of dry matter tended to increase the risk of milk fever in parous cows regardless of DCAD fed. Collectively, results support the recommendation of prepartum acidogenic diets to result in a negative DCAD to parous cows with improvements in lactation performance and reduced risk of diseases; however, the range of DCAD fed did not allow for detection of an optimum value for postpartum performance. On the other hand, despite improvements in blood concentrations of Ca and reduction in uterine diseases with a reduction in DCAD fed to nulliparous cows, productive performance was either depressed or unaffected and the limited number of experiments did not provide sufficient evidence for a recommended DCAD for this group of cows.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Hypothalamic inflammation and dysfunction may be induced by high-fat diets. However, the mechanisms involved in this process have not been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVE: To evidence, in animal models, of how a high-fat diet influence the mechanisms involved in hypothalamic inflammation. DATA SOURCES: Scopus, PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Embase databases were searched. DATA EXTRACTION: The exclusion criteria were human studies, studies with medicinal products or other substances not related to food, paper reviews, studies that used a surgical intervention or an intervention with food to reverse hypothalamic inflammation, and studies with genetically modified animals. The identified studies were evaluated according to the following inclusion criteria: animal studies, studies in which a control group was included in the experimental design, and studies in which markers of inflammation in the hypothalamus were evaluated. DATA ANALYSIS: A total of 322 studies were found, of which 9 met the inclusion criteria for a systematic review, conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, and were included in this review. CONCLUSION: The exposure of rodents to high-fat diets promoted an increase in levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and other proteins involved in the inflammatory process in the hypothalamus.

	doi = {10.1186/s13071-019-3339-5},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The zoonotic parasite Taenia saginata utilizes bovines as an intermediate host (causing cysticercosis) and humans as the definitive host (causing taeniosis). The public health burden of T. saginata is assumed to be low, but the economic burden is large, due to the resources utilized in the detection and condemnation of infected carcasses and carcass parts. As part of a collaborative effort to synthesize worldwide epidemiological data on this parasite, we present here the results of a systematic review on the distribution of T. saginata taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). METHODS: Information on the occurrence and prevalence of T. saginata taeniosis and cysticercosis in the MENA region was obtained through a systematic review of published and grey literature, including OIE reports, published between January 1st, 1990 and December 31st, 2017. RESULTS: A total of 63 publications were retrieved across the 21 MENA countries. Taenia saginata taeniosis was reported in 11 of these countries, whereas unspecified taeniosis was reported for a further seven. Microscopy-based prevalence values ranged between 0.02-8.6\%. Bovine cysticercosis prevalence estimates based on meat inspection were only reported for Egypt and Israel, with prevalence data ranging between 0.2-20\% and 0.1-9.1\% for cattle and buffaloes, respectively. The presence of bovine cysticercosis could be confirmed for 10 additional countries through OIE reports. CONCLUSIONS: Human taeniosis occurrence was confirmed for 86\% (18/21) of the countries in the MENA region, although in several of these countries the species responsible was not specified. Religious prohibitions on the consumption of pork and the limited extent of pig farming across much of this region, however, suggest that many reported taeniosis cases are likely to be attributable to T. saginata rather than Taenia solium or Taenia asiatica. There was a paucity of data regarding both the prevalence and economic impact of bovine cysticercosis. More detailed epidemiological data on both T. saginata taeniosis and bovine cysticercosis could be obtained by adopting an integrated "One Health" approach, considering the characteristics (e.g. ecosystem related and sociopolitical aspects) of the MENA region. Compared with more conventional approaches, this could lead to an enhanced performance and cost-effectiveness of surveillance systems.},

	abstract = {This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to summarize the effects of maternal undernutrition or overnutrition during pregnancy on fetal weight and morphometric measurements during pregnancy, at birth, and postnatal period in sheep. After completing the search, selection, and data extraction steps, the measure of effect was generated by the individual comparison of each indicator with the average of the control and treated group (undernutrition or overnutrition) using the DerSimonian and Laird method for random effects. Subgroup analyses were also performed for lambing order, litter size, sex, as well as level, timing, and duration of the intervention. Fetal weight during the first third of pregnancy was not affected by maternal undernutrition or overnutrition. On the other hand, undernutrition in the second and last third of gestation reduces the weight of the lamb both during pregnancy, at birth, and during the postnatal period, requiring at least 120 postnatal days to achieve the same weight as its contemporaries in the control treatment. However, this reduction in weight is not accompanied by reductions in morphometric measurements, demonstrating that the animals were lighter, but of equal size. In overnutrition, there is an increase in fetal weight in the second third of gestation. However, in the last third of the gestational period, there are no differences in fetal weight for the multiparous subgroup, but it was reduced in primiparous ewes. There are no effects of overnutrition on birth weight; however, this result is highly heterogeneous. Thus, maternal nutrition of ewe during pregnancy has effects on fetal and postnatal weight, but not on size. Furthermore, the effects of undernutrition are more homogeneous while overnutrition showed heterogeneous responses.},

Aspalathus linearis, commonly known as rooibos, is a rich source of uncommon glycosylated plant polyphenols with various critical health-promoting properties, including the prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus (DM). This study aimed to examine these effects by meta-analyzing the current evidence in diabetic rodent models. Peer-reviewed studies written in English from two databases, PubMed and Embase, were searched up to 28 February 2018. Studies reporting blood glucose levels in diabetic rodents with and without receiving rooibos extracts or their major phenolic compounds are included. Twelve studies enrolling 88 diabetic rodents treated with rooibos extracts or their polyphenols and 85 diabetic control males reported blood glucose levels. The pooled effect size was -0.89 (95\% CI: -1.44 to -0.35) with a substantial heterogeneity (I² = 67.0\%). This effect was likely to be modified by type of rooibos extracts and their polyphenols and treatment period. Blood glucose levels were significantly lower in diabetic rodent models treated with the phenolic compound rich in rooibos extracts, PPAG.},

	abstract = {Objective : The aim of the study was to perform a literature review to analyze the effect of photobiomodulation in experimental studies on peripheral nerve regeneration after sciatic nerve crush injury in rodents. Methods: A bibliographic search was performed in the electronic databases, including MEDLINE (PubMed), SCOPUS, and SciELO, from 2008 to 2018. Results: A total of 1912 articles were identified in the search, and only 19 fulfilled all the inclusion criteria. Along with the parameters most found in the manuscripts, the most used wavelengths were 660 nm and 830 nm, power of 30 and 40 mW, and energy density of 4 and 10 J/cm(2) . For total energy throughout the intervention period, the lowest energy found with positive effects was 0.70 J, and the highest 1.141 J. Seventeen studies reported positive effects on nerve regeneration. The variables selected to analyze the effect were: Sciatic Functional Index (SFI), Static Sciatic Index (SSI), morphometric, morphological, histological, zymographic, electrophysiological, resistance mechanics and range of motion (ROM). The variety of parameters used in the studies demonstrated that there is yet no pre-determined protocol for treating peripheral nerve regeneration. Only two studies by different authors used the same power, energy density, beam area, and power density. Conclusion: It was concluded that the therapeutic window of the photobiomodulation presents a high variability of parameters with the wavelength (632.8 to 940 nm), power (5 to 170 mW) and energy density (3 to 280 J /cm(2) ), promoting nerve regeneration through the expression of cytokines and growth factors that aid in modulating the inflammatory process, improving morphological aspects, restoring the functionality to the animals in a brief period.},

This review aimed at exploring the results of the behavioral tools and tests which have been used to evaluate cognitive dysfunction in different animal models of sepsis. Two independent investigators searched for sepsis- and cognition-related keywords. 6323 publications were found, of which 355 were selected based on their title, and 226 of these were chosen based on manuscript review. LPS was used to induce sepsis in 171 studies, while CLP was used in 55 studies. Inhibitory avoidance was the most widely used method for assessing aversive memory, followed by fear conditioning and continuous multi-trial inhibitory avoidance. With regard to non-aversive memory, most studies used the water maze, open-field, object recognition, Y-maze, plus maze, and radial maze tests. Both CLP and LPS models of sepsis were effective in inducing short- and long-term behavioral impairment. Our findings help elucidate the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of sepsis-induced cognitive changes, as well as the available methods and tests used to study this in animal models.},

	abstract = {Mycoplasma gallisepticum is one of the most important poultry pathogens that can also infect wild birds, but knowledge of potential non-poultry hosts that could be reservoirs of M. gallisepticum is limited. For the paper presented here, we screened three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and the Web of Knowledge) to find articles on the occurrence of M. gallisepticum in different wild bird species that were published between 1951 and 2018. Among 314 studies found, we selected and included 50 original articles that met the pre-established criteria. From those publications we extracted the following information: name of the first author, year of publication, year of sample isolation, country, region, number of birds sampled, number of birds tested by each method, number of positive samples, diagnostic criteria, and if birds were wild or captive. Because different detection techniques were used to confirm the presence of M. gallisepticum in one animal, we decided to perform the meta analyses separately for each method. The estimated prevalence of M. gallisepticum in wild birds was different by each method of detection. Our summary revealed that M. gallisepticum was present in 56 species of bird belonging to 11 different orders, of which 21 species were reported suffering both past and current infection. Our work provides information on wild bird species that could be considered potential reservoirs or carriers of M. gallisepticum and could be helpful to set the direction for future research on the spread and phylogeny of M. gallisepticum in different hosts.},

The aim of this study was to present a systematic review of literature on the prognostic significance of morphotypes in canine lymphomas. Standardized Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria were applied. Retrospective and prospective studies were included. Level of evidence was determined for each study. Some acceptable evidence suggested a significant prognostic impact of morphotypes in canine lymphomas. However, the evidence is not sufficiently robust to determine with precision the most appropriate classification scheme. Updated Kiel and World Health Organization (WHO) classifications seem to remain the most appropriate classification systems with regards to the number of available studies and their levels of evidence. Limitations included lack of randomized control trial, and relative lack of prospective studies available. Current recommended classification of canine lymphoma is the systematic determination of morphotype in each new case. The Updated Kiel and the WHO classifications adapted to dog both remain the schemes with the most valuable interest. Prospective studies in larger population, and international consensus to define precisely each morphotype, are warranted, with application of standardized staging method and treatment.},

In this meta-analysis, we sought to evaluate the potential infarct size-modulating effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in preclinical studies. METHODS: In this preregistered meta-analysis (PROSPERO: CRD42020189124), we included placebo-controlled, interventional studies of small and large animal models of myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury, testing the effect of SGLT2 inhibitor treatment on myocardial infarct size (percentage of area at risk or total area). Standardised mean differences (SMDs) were calculated and pooled using random-effects method. We evaluated heterogeneity by computing Τ(2) and I(2) values. Meta-regression was performed to explore prespecified subgroup differences according to experimental protocols and their contribution to heterogeneity was assessed (pseudo-R(2) values). RESULTS: We identified ten eligible publications, reporting 16 independent controlled comparisons on a total of 224 animals. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitor significantly reduced myocardial infarct size compared with placebo (SMD = -1.30 [95\% CI -1.79, -0.81], p {\textless} 0.00001), referring to a 33\% [95\% CI 20\%, 47\%] difference. Heterogeneity was moderate (Τ(2) = 0.58, I(2) = 60\%). SGLT2 inhibitors were only effective when administered to the intact organ system, but not to isolated hearts (p interaction {\textless}0.001, adjusted pseudo-R(2) = 47\%). While acute administration significantly reduced infarct size, chronic treatment was superior (p interaction {\textless}0.001, adjusted pseudo-R(2) = 85\%). The medications significantly reduced infarct size in both diabetic and non-diabetic animals, favouring the former (p interaction = 0.030, adjusted pseudo-R(2) = 12\%). Treatment was equally effective in rats and mice, as well as in a porcine model. Individual study quality scores were not related to effect estimates (p = 0.33). The overall effect estimate remained large even after adjusting for severe forms of publication bias. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The glucose-lowering SGLT2 inhibitors reduce myocardial infarct size in animal models independent of diabetes. Future in vivo studies should focus on clinical translation by exploring whether SGLT2 inhibitors limit infarct size in animals with relevant comorbidities, on top of loading doses of antiplatelet agents. Mechanistic studies should elucidate the potential relationship between the infarct size-lowering effect of SGLT2 inhibitors and the intact organ system.},

Success of a drug design is dependent on correct biological evaluation. Concerning new drug designs for Chagas disease, it is essential to first identify the most effective, existing, experimental chronic protocols that can be used for comparison purposes. Here, we present a literature review regarding experimental models with chronic Chagas disease to evaluate the efficacy of benznidazole (BZN). We searched literature published in PubMed and Web of Science databases, using these keywords: animal model, BZN, Chagas disease, T. cruzi, and chronic phase, with no timeframe limitations. We excluded articles involving acute phase animal models and/or those without BZN treatment. The selected studies were conducted using different BZN concentrations (10mg-100mg) involving several different periods (5-70 days). Concentrations and durations of use are directly related to side effects, but do not prevent chronic tissue lesions. BZN use during the late/chronic phases of Chagas disease is unable to eliminate amastigote forms present in infected tissues. This study suggests the administration of a lower BZN concentration ({\textless}100mg/kg/day) during the chronic phase of the animal model, as this had been reported to result in fewer side effects.},

The worldwide pooled PI prevalences at animal level ranged from low (≤0.8\% Europe, North America, Australia), medium ({\textgreater}0.8\% to 1.6\% East Asia) to high ({\textgreater}1.6\% West Asia). The PI and AB prevalences in Europe decreased over time, while BVDV prevalence increased in North America.

Databases used: PubMed and Web of Science; search terms: horse, sedation and score. Conclusions: Most authors distinguish between sedation depth, sedation quality and degree of ataxia. These three features are evaluated using scoring systems similar to those classically used to assess pain, i.e. simple descriptive scales, numerical rating scales (NRS), visual analogue scales and/or multifactorial sedation scales. In addition, head height above the ground is often used as a measure of the depth of sedation. Very few authors have described how to adjust the administration rate or dose of alpha-2 agonists. Based on the available literature, the Ghent Sedation Algorithm was developed, which assigns scores (NRS) for degree of ataxia, sedation depth and surgical conditions, and uses these to prescribe changes in the administration rate of constant rate infusions of alpha-2 agonists. Studies are needed to validate this algorithm.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to provide a comprehensive synthesis of available evidence evaluating the effect of dietary loading on temporomandibular joint/condyle, condylar cartilage, alveolar bone of the mandible and the periodontal ligament in healthy mice and rats. DESIGN: Medline via PubMed, EMBASE and Open Grey databases were searched for published and unpublished literature. Search terms included "mandiblular condyle", "alveolar bone", "temporomandibular joint", "condylar cartilage", "periodontal ligament", "rat", "mice". After data extraction, risk of bias (SYRCLE) and reporting quality (ARRIVE) were assessed. Random effects meta-analyses were performed for the outcomes of interest where applicable. RESULTS: A total of 33 relevant articles were considered in the systematic review, while only 6 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. Risk of Bias in all studies was judged to be unclear to high overall, while reporting quality was suboptimal. Comparing soft to hard diet animals, significantly reduced anteroposterior condylar length (4 studies, weighted mean difference: -0.40 mm; 95\% CI: -0.47, -0.32; p {\textless} 0.001) and width (4 studies, weighted mean difference: -0.043 mm; 95\% CI: -0.51, -0.36; p {\textless} 0.001) were found in rats. Decreased anteroposterior condylar dimensions were detected for mice as well (2 studies, weighted mean difference: -0.049; 95\% CI: -0.56, -0.43; p {\textless} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there was strong evidence to suggest a significant effect of soft diet on reduced condylar dimensions in rodents; however, there is need for further high quality experimental studies to inform current knowledge on condylar cartilage, alveolar bone and periodontal ligament related outcomes.},

STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. SAMPLE POPULATION: Peer-reviewed English-language articles describing the treatment and outcome of naturally occurring pericardial effusion in domestic dogs. METHODS: A literature search was performed with PubMed, Cab Abstracts, Scopus, and Agricola in August 2019 for articles describing pericardial effusion treatment in dogs. Inclusion criteria were applied, and articles were evaluated for reported outcome and level of evidence by using The Oxford 2011 Levels of Evidence, a previously described hierarchical system, and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation). RESULTS: One hundred eight of the 641 unique articles that were identified and evaluated met inclusion criteria. Most articles included were case studies (68.2\%) or retrospective case series (25.2\%), with all articles providing a low level of evidence. The articles had inconsistent inclusion criteria, outcome measures, and follow-up, making comparison of outcomes difficult. CONCLUSION: Because of the low quality of evidence of the studies included in this systematic review and the variability of the outcomes, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend one treatment option rather than another. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: There is a requirement for higher quality evidence such as randomized controlled trials and prospective comparative cohort studies. Standardization of outcome measures reported for each treatment option and disease process studied will allow for better comparison of outcomes between studies.},

	abstract = {Rats and mice are widely used to study environmental effects on psychological and metabolic health. Study designs differ widely and are often characterized by varying (social) housing conditions. In itself, housing has a profound influence on physiology and behaviour of rodents, affecting energy balance and sustainable metabolic health. However, evidence for potential long-term consequences of individual versus social housing on body weight and metabolic phenotype is inconsistent. We conducted a systematic literature review and meta-analyses assessing effects of individual versus social housing of rats and mice, living under well-accepted laboratory conditions, on measures of metabolic health, including body weight, food intake and visceral adipose tissue mass. Seventy-one studies were included in this review; 59 were included in the meta-analysis. Whilst housing did not affect body weight, both food intake and visceral adipose tissue mass were significantly higher in individually compared with socially housed animals. A combination of emotional stress and lack of social thermoregulation likely contributed to these effects. Increased awareness of consequences and improved specifications of housing conditions are necessary to accurately evaluate efficacy of drugs, diets or other interventions on metabolic and other health outcomes because housing conditions are rarely considered as possible moderators of reported outcomes.},

	abstract = {Biochar, that is, carbonized biomass similar to charcoal, has been used in acute medical treatment of animals for many centuries. Since 2010, livestock farmers increasingly use biochar as a regular feed supplement to improve animal health, increase nutrient intake efficiency and thus productivity. As biochar gets enriched with nitrogen-rich organic compounds during the digestion process, the excreted biochar-manure becomes a more valuable organic fertilizer causing lower nutrient losses and greenhouse gas emissions during storage and soil application. Scientists only recently started to investigate the mechanisms of biochar in the different stages of animal digestion and thus most published results on biochar feeding are based so far on empirical studies. This review summarizes the state of knowledge up to the year 2019 by evaluating 112 relevant scientific publications on the topic to derive initial insights, discuss potential mechanisms behind observations and identify important knowledge gaps and future research needs. The literature analysis shows that in most studies and for all investigated farm animal species, positive effects on different parameters such as toxin adsorption, digestion, blood values, feed efficiency, meat quality and/or greenhouse gas emissions could be found when biochar was added to feed. A considerable number of studies provided statistically non-significant results, though tendencies were mostly positive. Rare negative effects were identified in regard to the immobilization of liposoluble feed ingredients (e.g., vitamin E or Carotenoids) which may limit long-term biochar feeding. We found that most of the studies did not systematically investigate biochar properties (which may vastly differ) and dosage, which is a major drawback for generalizing results. Our review demonstrates that the use of biochar as a feed additive has the potential to improve animal health, feed efficiency and livestock housing climate, to reduce nutrient losses and greenhouse gas emissions, and to increase the soil organic matter content and thus soil fertility when eventually applied to soil. In combination with other good practices, co-feeding of biochar may thus have the potential to improve the sustainability of animal husbandry. However, more systematic multi-disciplinary research is definitely needed to arrive at generalizable recommendations.},

	abstract = {Echinococcus multilocularis is a zoonotic cestode of canid definitive hosts that is emerging as a parasite of medical and veterinary concern in regions of North America, Europe and Asia. Infection with the metacestode stage (alveolar echinococcosis - AE) is life-threatening, especially for patients who reside in low resource countries and lack access to modern diagnostic tests and treatments. The overall objectives of this One Health review were to systematically describe the diagnostic tests currently employed in endemic countries to detect E. multilocularis in people, canids and the environment, and to report the test characteristics of new diagnostic techniques for population surveillance. In this systematic review of English and Chinese language databases, we identified 92 primary records of E. multilocularis surveillance in canids (N = 75), humans (N = 20) and/or the environment (food, soil; N = 3) and 12 grey literature records that reported E. multilocularis surveillance or health systems protocols between 2008 and 2018. Surveillance for E. multilocularis was conducted using a broad range of combined morphological, molecular, immunological and imaging techniques. Nine studies reporting diagnostic evaluations for cestode or metacestode detection were identified, including studies on copro-antigen ELISA, copro-PCR, intestinal examination, Western Blot, magnetic capture RT-PCR and immunochromatography. Our dataset includes prevalence estimates for E. multilocularis in canids, people, or environment in 27 of the 43 endemic countries and reports data gaps in surveillance, laboratory methods, and diagnostic sensitivity. International consensus on gold standard diagnostic techniques and harmonization of human, canid and environmental surveillance data across political boundaries are needed to comprehensively assess the global burden and distribution of this parasite.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Large quantities of antimicrobials are given to food animals, particularly in feed, potentially increasing antimicrobial resistance in humans. However, the magnitude of this effect is unclear. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase and Web of Science for studies on interventions that limited antimicrobial use in food animals, in any setting and context, to reduce antimicrobial resistance 1) in those food animals; and 2) in humans. We validated our strategy by testing whether it identified known relevant studies. Data from included studies were extracted into pre-designed and pilot-tested forms. RESULTS: We included 104 articles containing 93 studies. Heterogeneity (different animal species, environs, antimicrobial classes, interventions, administration routes, sampling, and methods), was considerable, precluding meta-analysis. The evidence was therefore synthesised narratively. A total of 89 studies (3 directly, 86 indirectly) addressed whether limiting antimicrobial exposure in food animals led to decreased antimicrobial resistance in those animals. The evidence was adequate to conclude this, although the magnitude of the effect could not be quantified. Four studies (1 directly, 3 indirectly) examined whether withdrawal of antibiotics changed resistance of potential pathogens in retail food for human consumption, and in bacteria of humans themselves. The direct (observational) study of broiler hatchery in ovo antimicrobial injection found a credible effect in terms of size reduction and time sequences. INTERPRETATION: Limiting antimicrobial use in food animals reduces antimicrobial resistance in food animals, and probably reduces antimicrobial resistance in humans. The magnitude of the effect cannot be quantified.},

Unfortunately, the terms used for the different dimensions of hoof structures differ widely. We conducted a systematic literature review with the aim of collecting terms used for hoof measurements, and to analyze the findings. Our body of literature consisted of papers and recommended reference books, written in both English and in German over the past 10 years. More than 600 scientific papers were found using the search string "TITLE-ABS-KEY ((equine OR horse) AND hoof) AND PUBYEAR {\textgreater} 2009 AND (LIMIT-TO (SUBJAREA, 'VETE"))" in Scopus'. Additionally, 5 handbooks were taken into account. A total of 80 Distances, 24 Angles, 34 Ratios and 16 Other measures (e.g. area of sole surface, mediolateral hoof balance) were identified. The highest number of entries (49) was recorded for the caudal angle between Pars dorsalis of the hoof and the ground line, termed often as hoof angle, dorsal hoof wall angle, or toe angle (10 English/2 German terms in total). The length of the Facies solearis, Distance between the outer extent of Pars dorsalis and dorsal cortex of Phalanx distalis; and the caudal angle between Margo solearis of Phalanx distalis and the ground line were classified as measures with highly inconsistent nomenclature (terms/entries of measure 16/25, 17/28 and 17/30, respectively). The most consistent nomenclature was recorded for the term Heel length (12/12). One should be aware of the fact that different terms might be used for the same item or that the same term might signify different measures in different publications. Established terms are not always anatomically correct. We recommend defining every used term in detail, in both written form using correct anatomical nomenclature, and in a figure. The same terms should be used in all publications of one working group. Suggestions for consistent terminology of 15 commonly used measurements in English and German are provided in the paper.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditionally, wide lateral surgical margins of 3 cm and one fascial plane deep have been recommended for resection of canine cutaneous mast cell tumor (MCT). Several studies have been published assessing surgical margins of less than this traditional recommendation. The objective of this systematic review was to determine if resection MCT with lateral surgical margins {\textless} 3 cm results in low rates of incomplete resection and local tumor recurrence. Systematic searches of digital bibliographic databases were performed with two authors (AR \& LES) screening abstracts to identify relevant scientific articles. Studies regarding surgical treatment of dogs with cutaneous MCT were reviewed. Data abstraction was performed and the quality of individual studies and the strength of the body of evidence for utilization of surgical margins {\textless} 3 cm for removal of MCTs was assessed. RESULTS: From the initial 78 citations identified through the database searches, four articles were retained for data abstraction after both relevance screenings were performed. Two studies were retrospective observational studies, one was a prospective case series and one was a prospective clinical trial. Assessment of the quality level of the body of evidence identified using the GRADE system was low. Excision of MCT at 2 cm and 3 cm was associated with comparably low rates of incomplete excision and recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the low quality of the overall body of evidence, a recommendation can be made that resection of canine cutaneous MCTs ({\textless} 4 cm) of Patnaik grade I and II with 2 cm lateral margins and 1 fascial plane deep results in low rates of incomplete excision and local tumor recurrence.},

HW infections composed 2\%-100\% of cases in EVD and 5\%-50\% of cases in MVD outbreaks. Among exposed HWs, 0.6\%-92\% developed EVD, and 1\%-10\% developed MVD. HW infection rates were consistent through outbreaks. The most common exposure risk situations were inadequate personal protective equipment and exposure to patients with unrecognized EVD/MVD. Similar risks were reported in past EVD/MVD outbreaks and in the recent outbreak in West Africa. CONCLUSIONS: Many outbreaks reported high proportions of infected HWs. Similar HW infection rates and exposure risk factors in both past and recent EVD and MVD outbreaks emphasize the need to improve the implementation of appropriate infection control measures consistently across all healthcare settings.},

This review aimed at assessing the ESBL-PE clones circulating in humans, animals and the environment to provide evidence-based insights for combating ESBL-PE using One Health approach. Systematic search from Medline/PubMed, Google Scholar and African Journals Online was carried out and retrieved nine eligible articles (of 131) based on phenotypic and genotypic detection of ESBL-PE between 2005 and 2016 in Tanzania. Analysis was performed using STATA 11.0 software to delineate the prevalence of ESBL-PE, phenotypic resistance profiles and clones circulating in the three interfaces. The overall prevalence of ESBL-PE in the three interfaces was 22.6\% (95\% CI: 21.1-24.2) with the predominance of Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains (51.6\%). The majority of ESBL-PE were resistant to the commonly used antimicrobials such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline/doxycycline, 38\%-55\% were resistant to ciprofloxacin and all were sensitive to meropenem/imipenem. ESBL-PE infections were more associated with deaths compared to non-ESBL-PE infections. Strikingly, E. coli ST38, ST131 and ST2852 were found to intersect variably across the three interfaces. The predominant allele, bla(CTX-M-15,) was found mostly in the conjugative IncF plasmids connoting transmission potential. The high prevalence of ESBL-PE and shared clones across the three interfaces, including the global E. coli ST131 clone, indicates wide and inter-compartmental spread that calls for One Health genomic-driven studies to track the resistome flow.},

The purpose of this systematic review was to clarify the morphology of SCB following BMS in preclinical, translational animal models. DESIGN: The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were systematically reviewed using specific search terms on April 19, 2016 based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The morphology of the SCB was assessed using of microcomputed tomography (bone density) and histology (microscopic architecture). RESULTS: Seventeen animal studies with 520 chondral lesions were included. The morphology of SCB did not recover following BMS. Compared with untreated chondral defects, BMS resulted in superior morphology of superficial SCB and cartilage but inferior morphology (specifically bone density, P {\textless} 0.05) of the deep SCB. Overall, the use of biological adjuvants during BMS resulted in the superior postoperative morphology of SCB. CONCLUSIONS: Alterations in the SCB following BMS were confirmed. Biologics adjuvants may improve the postoperative morphology of both SCB and articular cartilage. Refinements of BMS techniques should incorporate consideration of SCB damage and restoration. Investigations to optimize BMS techniques incorporating both minimally invasive approaches and biologically augmented platforms are further warranted.},

	abstract = {Unicellular eukaryotes of the Trypanosomatidae family include human and animal pathogens that belong to the Trypanosoma and Leishmania genera. Diagnosis of the diseases they cause requires the sampling of body fluids (e.g., blood, lymph, peritoneal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid) or organ biopsies (e.g., bone marrow, spleen), which are mostly obtained through invasive methods. Body fluids or appendages can be alternatives to these invasive biopsies but appropriateness remains poorly studied. To further address this question, we perform a systematic review on clues evidencing the presence of parasites, genetic material, antibodies, and antigens in body secretions, appendages, or the organs or proximal tissues that produce these materials. Paper selection was based on searches in PubMed, Web of Science, WorldWideScience, SciELO, Embase, and Google. The information of each selected article (n = 333) was classified into different sections and data were extracted from 77 papers. The presence of Trypanosomatidae parasites has been tracked in most of organs or proximal tissues that produce body secretions or appendages, in naturally or experimentally infected hosts. The meta-analysis highlights the paucity of studies on human African trypanosomiasis and an absence on animal trypanosomiasis. Among the collected data high heterogeneity in terms of the I(2) statistic (100\%) is recorded. A high positivity is recorded for antibody and genetic material detection in urine of patients and dogs suffering leishmaniasis, and of antigens for leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. Data on conjunctival swabs can be analyzed with molecular methods solely for dogs suffering canine visceral leishmaniasis. Saliva and hair/bristles showed a pretty good positivity that support their potential to be used for leishmaniasis diagnosis. In conclusion, our study pinpoints significant gaps that need to be filled in order to properly address the interest of body secretion and hair or bristles for the diagnosis of infections caused by Leishmania and by other Trypanosomatidae parasites.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several options have been proposed for the treatment of congenital extrahepatic portosystemic shunts (cEHPSS) in dogs, but formal comparisons among different treatment options are currently unavailable. A previous evidence-based review (2012) found low quality of evidence for papers assessing the treatment of cEHPSS in dogs. OBJECTIVES: To assess the quality of evidence available in the treatment of cEHPSS, summarize the current state of knowledge with respect to outcome after cEHPSS management, and compare different treatment techniques. ANIMALS: Not used. METHODS: A bibliographic search was performed without date or language restrictions. Studies were assessed for quality of evidence (study design, study group sizes, subject enrollment quality, and overall risk of bias) and outcome measures reported (perioperative outcome, clinical outcome, and surgical or interventional outcome), all reported with 95\% confidence intervals. A network meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: Forty-eight studies were included. Six retrospective studies (grade 4b) compared 2 techniques and 7 were abstracts (grade 5). The quality of evidence was low and risk of bias high. Regarding surgical outcome, statistically significant superiority of ameroid constrictor over thin film band was observed (P = .003). No other comparisons were statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE: The evidence base of choice of treatment of cEHPSS in dogs remains weak despite recent publications on the subject. Ameroid is superior to thin film band in causing EHPSS closure. Blinded randomized studies comparing different treatment modalities, which routinely include postoperative imaging to assess cEHPSS closure and acquired portosystemic shunt development are essential.},

Blastocystis sp. infects the intestinal lumen of humans and a wide range of animals, while there is a lack of comprehensive information on Blastocystis epidemiology in cattle worldwide. Thus, the present systematic review and meta-analysis were performed by exploring four electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google scholar) for relevant published papers up to 7th November 2020, utilizing a random-effects model to pool estimations and assign 95 \% confidence intervals (CIs). Results of 28 studies (29 datasets) on cattle showed a 24.4 \% (95 \% CI: 16.9-33.9 \%) prevalence for Blastocystis infection. Also, 16 out of 26 reported subtypes (STs) were isolated from cattle, with ST10 (18 datasets) as the highest-reported [32.3 \% (95 \% CI: 21.6-45.3)] as well as ST24 and ST25 (one study each) as the lowest-reported STs [1.4 \% (95 \% CI: 0.2-9.1)]. Additionally, among nine well-known zoonotic STs (ST1-ST8 and ST12), all STs except for ST8 were reported from cattle worldwide, demonstrating this animal species as a potential reservoir for human infections. Meanwhile, the overall prevalence of Blastocystis in various subgroups (publication year, WHO regions, countries, continents, and age groups) was analyzed separately. The finding of the present review article highlights the cattle as a significant source of zoonotic transmission of Blastocystis infection to humans, which must be considered for preventive measures.},

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the effects of animal versus plant protein intake on bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC) and select bone biomarkers in healthy adults. METHODS: Searches across five databases were conducted through 10/31/16 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies in healthy adults that examined the effects of animal versus plant protein intake on 1) total body (TB), total hip (TH), lumbar spine (LS) or femoral neck (FN) BMD or TB BMC for at least one year, or 2) select bone formation and resorption biomarkers for at least six months. Strength of evidence (SOE) was assessed and random effect meta-analyses were performed. RESULTS: Seven RCTs examining animal vs. isoflavone-rich soy (Soy+) protein intake in 633 healthy peri-menopausal (n = 1) and post-menopausal (n = 6) women were included. Overall risk of bias was medium. Limited SOE suggests no significant difference between Soy+ vs. animal protein on LS, TH, FN and TB BMD, TB BMC, and bone turnover markers BSAP and NTX. Meta-analysis results showed on average, the differences between Soy+ and animal protein groups were close to zero and not significant for BMD outcomes (LS: n = 4, pooled net \% change: 0.24\%, 95\% CI: -0.80\%, 1.28\%; TB: n = 3, -0.24\%, 95\% CI: -0.81\%, 0.33\%; FN: n = 3, 0.13\%, 95\% CI: -0.94\%, 1.21\%). All meta-analyses had no statistical heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support soy protein consumption as more advantageous than animal protein, or vice versa. Future studies are needed examining the effects of different protein sources in different populations on BMD, BMC, and fracture.},

The aim of this systematic review was to examine the relation between ASF consumption and stunting in children aged 6-60 mo in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The secondary aim was to examine the relation between ASF consumption and other indicators of growth and development (length/height, weight, head circumference, and anemia). A search of the peer-reviewed and grey literature published from January 1980 to June 2017 was conducted. Databases searched included CINAHL, Embase, Global Index Medicus, PubMed, and Web of Science. There were 14,783 records and 116 full text articles dual screened; 21 studies were included in the review and were dual evaluated for risk of bias (RoB). The relation between ASF and stunting (length- or height-for-age z-score←2) was examined in randomized-controlled trials [(RCTs), n = 3] and cross-sectional studies (n = 4) only; ASF reduced stunting in 1 RCT and was associated with reduced stunting in 1 cross-sectional study. We did not identify any longitudinal cohorts that examined this relation. The relation between ASF and secondary indicators length/height, weight, head circumference, and anemia were largely nonsignificant across study designs. The intervention/exposure, comparator, outcome measures, methods, and analyses were highly heterogeneous. Although we did not find a consistent relation between ASF consumption and our primary and secondary outcomes, this may have been a function of inconsistencies in study design. Foods in the whole diet, particularly combination dishes, are inherently difficult to assess. To quantitatively assess the relation between ASF and stunting and other indicators of growth and iron status in early childhood, future research should provide consistency in the definition and quantification of the exposure and outcomes allowing for interstudy quantitative comparisons.},

	abstract = {Context • Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major public health problem in developing and developed countries. Elevated cholesterol levels, especially low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and the emergence of CHD, have been positively correlated in many clinical and epidemiological studies. The health benefits of probiotics have received a great deal of attention, including their blood cholesterol-lowering effects on humans. Objective • The research team intended to determine the current state of research examining the effects of various probiotic strains on lipid profiles, including measures in serum of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Design • The review examined studies, in both animal and human models and focused on the potential of various probiotic strains to be dietary adjuncts in lowering levels of serum cholesterol with the aim of reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CHD. Articles were reviewed systematically from Web search bases including PubMed and Cochrane Clinical Trial Registry. Articles meeting the inclusion search criteria were selected for further review and analysis. Only randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of probiotics on lipid profiles in animals or humans were considered for inclusion in the review. Setting • The selection of articles and further inclusion in the review was performed in Institute of Home Economics, University of Delhi (New Delhi, India). Results • Some of the studies, in both animal and human models, have revealed that several strains were able to improve at least 1 lipid fraction. Although the results from animal studies have been fairly consistent, the findings from studies on humans have varied. Some strains when evaluated in human studies have shown insignificant effects on lipid fractions. Conclusions • Although several mechanisms for cholesterol removal by probiotics have been proposed, they need further investigation to be validated.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.animal.2021.100245},
	abstract = {Infectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK) is a common ocular disease in cattle that causes economic losses to producers and negatively impacts animal welfare. In a 2016 survey of cow-calf producers in California, IBK was identified as the disease for which antimicrobials are most frequently used. The presented scoping review examined the available literature for methods to prevent IBK and for alternatives to antimicrobials to treat the disease that can be applied in cow-calf operations. Online databases were searched for publications about IBK in cattle populations that were reported from 1950 to 2020. Citations were systematically evaluated in a multi-stage approach using commercial software and summarized in a scoping review format. For the studies included in the review, most research (n = 50) has focused on the development of vaccines for the prevention of IBK. Although the quality of publications has improved over time, there is a lack of consistent evidence for vaccine efficacy against IBK in post-2000 experimental and conventional vaccine trials. A systematic analysis of vaccine studies is warranted. A limited number (n = 6) of studies evaluated the prevention of IBK through fly control, where most have found efficacy of this control measure. Several treatment options (n = 5) that do not include the use of antimicrobials have been investigated but remain at the preliminary stage of testing. Differences in breed susceptibility has been demonstrated with breeds belonging to the Bos indicus subspecies less frequently affected compared to those belonging to the Bos taurus subspecies. Hereford cattle and those lacking pigmentation around the eyelid margin are more frequently affected than other breeds. At present, there are few evidence-based measures that producers can utilize to reduce the burden of IBK in their herds and more research into the efficacy of fly control measures, non-antimicrobial treatment options, the continued search for a viable vaccine, as well as identifying genetic markers associated with traits that confer resistance to the disease are needed.},

We identified 418 reports; 108 were selected for full-text evaluation and 74 were included in final review. p38 MAPK was investigated using feto-maternal primary or immortalized cells, tissue explants, and animal models. Western blot was most commonly used to report phosphorylated (active) p38 MAPK. Human placenta (27), chorioamniotic membranes (14), myometrium (13), decidua (8), and cervix (1) were the studied tissues. p38 MAPK's functions were tissue and gestational age dependent. Isoform specificity was hardly reported. p38 MAPK activity was induced by ROS or proinflammatory cytokines to promote cell signaling linked to cell fate, primed uterus, ripened cervix, and proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine production. In 35 years, reports on p38 MAPK's role during pregnancy and parturition are scarce and current literature is insufficient to provide a comprehensive description of p38 MAPK's mechanistic role during pregnancy and parturition.},

The methodological quality of the included RCTs were evaluated using Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and a meta-analysis was performed. RESULTS: Seven studies were included in the review, and four studies were included in the meta-analysis. Comparing BVA plus conventional therapy (CT) with saline injection plus CT, it showed an effect in favor of BVA plus CT in visual analog scale (VAS) and pain rating scale (PRS) (p = 0.02, p = 0.009, respectively). Comparing BVA plus physiotherapy (PT) with saline injection plus PT, it showed that there was no significant difference in VAS and verbal rating scale (VRS) between the two groups.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Although Animal-Assisted Interventions (AAI) are effective treatments for a variety of psychological problems, the mechanism of treatment effectiveness remains unclear. Qualitative studies of AAI may reveal possible mechanisms. This review aims to synthesize qualitative research and identify factors that might contribute to the effectiveness of AAI. METHODS: A literature search of qualitative evidence published before August 8(th), 2018 was conducted using the following databases: PubMed, ERIC, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, and HABRI, with the aim of identifying qualitative research conducted with individuals undergoing AAI. Quality assessment was undertaken by CASP and the certainty of the evidence was evaluated using CERQual. RESULTS: A total of 1866 articles were reviewed, and seven were included in the final analysis. A total of six themes were identified as factors relating to the effectiveness of AAI: 1. Fostering feelings of normalcy, 2. Improving behavioral activation, 3. Self-esteem enhancement, 4. Physical contact, belonging, and companionship, 5. Calming and comforting, and 6. Distraction. Barriers to AAI effectiveness were also identified. CONCLUSION: The results of these studies suggest that AAI was viewed as a positive and highly accepted intervention across populations and settings. AAI might be a useful intervention among people who suffer from a variety of mental disorders. All themes consistently demonstrated that contact with a live animal is more important than the appearance of the animal. Additional investigations of AAI treatment mechanisms are needed.},

In this study, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of Chlamydia infection in swine in China. From PubMed, ScienceDirect, Chinese Web of knowledge (CNKI), VIP Chinese journal database, and Wanfang database, we collected a total of 72 publications reported in 1985-2020. The prevalence of Chlamydia was 22.48\% in China. In the sampling year subgroup, the prevalence after 2011 was the highest (26.14\%). In southern China, the prevalence was 30.97\%. By contrast, the prevalence in northern China was only 10.79\%. Also the difference was significant (p {\textless} 0.05). In the provincial level, Hubei had the highest rate of 36.23\%. Boars had a higher prevalence (29.47\%). The prevalence of Chlamydia detection in pigs with reproductive disorders (21.86\%) was higher than that without reproductive disorders. Among the three age groups, finishing pigs (21.43\%) had the highest prevalence. The prevalence in large-scale farmed pigs (28.58\%) was the highest in the subgroup of feeding methods. The prevalence in farms was 24.29\%, which was the highest in the survey areas. The prevalence in spring was the highest with 40.51\%. Other methods had the highest prevalence (39.61\%) than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect hemagglutination assay. The prevalence of Chlamydia psittaci 18.41\% was lower than the prevalence of Chlamydia abortus (41.35\%). We also analyzed the impact of different climate factor subgroups (rainfall, temperature, and humidity) on the probability of pigs suffering from the disease. The results showed that Chlamydia was widespread in pigs in China. We suggest that we should strengthen the detection of Chlamydia in the semen of breeding pigs and pigs with reproductive disorders, and reasonably control the environment of large-scale pig farms, so as to reduce further infection of Chlamydia in pigs.},

Background: While there have been meta-analysis that surveyed the efficacy of minocycline in the treatment of acute stroke, they have some methodological limitations. We performed a new systematic review which was distinct from previous one by adding new outcomes and including new studies. Methods: Document retrieval was executed through PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Stroke Center, NIH's Clinical Trials, Current Controlled Trials, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal before Jan 2018. The data meeting the inclusion criteria were extracted. Before meta-analysis, publication bias and heterogeneity of included studies were surveyed. Random and fixed-effects models were employed to calculate pooled estimates and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Additionally, sensitivity and subgroup analyses were implemented. Result: For clinical studies, 4 trials with 201 patients in the minocycline group, and 195 patients in the control group met the inclusion criteria; 3 were randomized trials. At the end of 90-day follow up or discharge day, results showed that the groups receiving minocycline were superior to the control group, with significant differences in the NIHSS scores (mean difference [MD], -2.75; 95\% CI, -4.78, 0.27; p = 0.03) and mRS scores (MD, -0.98; 95\% CI, -1.27, -0.69; p {\textless} 0.01), but not Barthel Index Score (MD, 9.04; 95\% CI, -0.78, 18.07; p = 0.07).

Neurological severity scores (NSS) was significantly improved (MD, -1.38; 95\% CI, -1.64, -1.31; p {\textless} 0.01) and infarct volume was obviously reduced (Std mean difference [SMD], -2.38; 95\% CI, -3.40, -1.36; p {\textless} 0.01) in the minocycline group. Heterogeneity among the studies was proved to exist for infarct volume (Chi(2) = 116.12, p {\textless} 0.01; I(2) = 0.89) but not for other variables.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Earlier studies suggest that probiotics have protective effects in the prevention of respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Whether such benefits apply to RTIs of viral origin and mechanisms supporting the effect remain unclear. AIM: To determine the role of gut microbiota modulation on clinical and laboratory outcomes of viral RTIs. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of articles published in Embase and MEDLINE through 20 April 2020 to identify studies reporting the effect of gut microbiota modulation on viral RTIs in clinical studies and animal models. The incidence of viral RTIs, clinical manifestations, viral load and immunological outcomes was evaluated. RESULTS: We included 58 studies (9 randomized controlled trials; 49 animal studies). Six of eight clinical trials consisting of 726 patients showed that probiotics administration was associated with a reduced risk of viral RTIs. Most commonly used probiotics were Lactobacillus followed by Bifidobacterium and Lactococcus. In animal models, treatment with probiotics before viral challenge had beneficial effects against influenza virus infection by improving infection-induced survival (20/22 studies), mitigating symptoms (21/21 studies) and decreasing viral load (23/25 studies). Probiotics and commensal gut microbiota exerted their beneficial effects through strengthening host immunity. CONCLUSION: Modulation of gut microbiota represents a promising approach against viral RTIs via host innate and adaptive immunity regulation. Further research should focus on next generation probiotics specific to viral types in prevention and treatment of emerging viral RTIs.},

	abstract = {Cholestasis is an important cause of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. Yinchenhao decoction has been used as a well-known traditional Chinese medicine used in the treatment of cholestasis for over 2,000 years. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the preclinical evidence of Yinchenhao decoction on cholestasis models. The following databases were searched from inception to February 2020. Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP medicine information system, Wanfang Database, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched. The content concerned Yinchenhao decoction on different animal model experiments for the treatment of cholestasis. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed based on the SYstematic Review Center for Laboratory animal Experimentation Animal Experiment Bias Risk Assessment Tool. A meta-analysis was conducted with RevMan 5.3 software according to the Cochrane tool. Nineteen studies on a total of 404 animals were included with five kinds of experimental animal models. The results showed that serum total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin and total bile acid in the group treated with Yinchenhao decoction were significantly lower than those in the model group (P {\textless} 0.00001). The alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase levels in the Yinchenhao decoction group were also significantly reduced (P {\textless} 0.00001). The subgroup analysis of the different models showed that Yinchenhao decoction had a significant effect on the bile duct ligation model, and there was a significant reduction in TBIL, DBIL and ALT levels (P {\textless} 0.00001) in ANIT-induced cholestasis. After 24 hours of Yinchenhao decoction treatment, there was no significant difference in TBIL levels (P = 0.34), but after 48 and 72 hours of treatment, the TBIL levels were significantly reduced compared with the model group (P {\textless} 0.00001). There was no significant difference in DBIL after 48 hours of administration (P = 0.26), but compared with the model group, Yinchenhao decoction could significantly reduce the DBIL levels after 48 hours of treatment (P {\textless} 0.0003). Yinchenhao decoction could significantly reduce the ALT levels after 24, 48 and 72 hours (P {\textless} 0.006). Yinchenhao decoction was able to significantly reduce the levels of TBIL, DBIL and ALT on different rat species: Wistar and Sprague Dawley (P = 0.0001; P = 0.0002). The preclinical evidence indicated that Yinchenhao decoction might be a potent and promising agent for cholestasis. Moreover, this conclusion should be further confirmed with more well-designed researches.},

METHODS: Both English and Chinese language databases were searched for articles that were published on or before 9 November 2018. After extraction and assessment of the included literature, Stata14.0 was applied to perform a meta-analysis to explore the impacts of LPM interventions. RESULTS: A total of 19 studies were identified. In total, 224 human, 3550 poultry, and 13 773 environment samples were collected before the intervention; 181 people, 4519 poultry, and 9562 environments were sampled after LPM interventions. Avian influenza virus (AIV) detection rates in the LPM environment (odds ratio [OR], 0.393; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.262-0.589) and the incidence of AIV infection (OR, 0.045; 95\% CI, 0.025-0.079) were significantly lower after LPM interventions, while interventions were not significantly effective in reducing AIV detection in poultry samples (OR, 0.803; 95\% CI, 0.403-1.597). CONCLUSIONS: LPM interventions can reduce AIV human infections and the detection rate of AIV in market environments.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the promising use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for ulcerative colitis (UC). METHODS: Studies reporting MSC treatment on UC were searched on five databases. Methodological quality was assessed based on the SYRCLE's Risk of Bias (RoB) tool and MINORS tool. Data analysis was conducted using Engauge Digitizer 10.8 and Stata 14.0. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria including 8 animal (n = 132) and 7 human (n = 216) trials. In animal studies, mice treated with MSCs had significantly lower disease activity index (DAI) than that in the control group: the 1st day (standardized mean difference (SMD) - 0.753, p = 0.027), the 3rd day (SMD - 1.634, p = 0.000), the 5th day (SMD - 2.124, p = 0.000), the 7th day (SMD - 5.327, p = 0.000), the 9th day (SMD - 2.979, p = 0.000), and the 14th day (SMD - 5.032, p = 0.000). Lower histopathological score (HS) (SMD - 5.15, p {\textless} 0.05) and longer colon length (SMD 2.147, p = 0.001) in mice treated with MSCs were also indicated. The main outcome in clinical trials showed, compared with control group, healing rate of patients accompanied by MSC therapy elevated obviously: MSCs vs 5-aminosalicylic acids (5-ASA) (RR = 2.317, p = 0.000) and MSCs + 5-ASA vs placebo + 5-ASA (RR = 5.118). The analytical data in 4 trials conducted with single-arm studies also demonstrated increased healing rate (0.787) after MSC treatment (p = 0.000). CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis results supported that MSCs could be an underlying method of treating UC.},

A systematic review of the prevalence over time in different countries may improve our understanding of gastrointestinal helminthiasis in chickens and subsequently lead to improved poultry health. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to provide an overview of the published information regarding the epidemiology and the diagnostic approaches of chicken helminth infection. Six databases were searched for studies, and a total of 2,985 articles published between 1942 and 2019 were identified and subsequently screened for eligibility using title or abstract and full text assessment, resulting in 191 publications to be used in the study. Postmortem diagnostics (73.8\%) and the flotation technique (28.8\%) were commonly used to detect helminth infections with a pooled prevalence of 79.4\% ranging from 4 to 100\%. More than 30 helminth species in chicken populations were identified including Ascaridia galli (35.9\%), Heterakis gallinarum (28.5\%), Capillaria spp. (5.90\%), and Raillietina spp. (19.0\%) being the most prevalent. The reported prevalence of helminth infection decreased over time in developing countries while it increased in the developed world. Chicken kept in backyard and free-range systems had a markedly higher pooled prevalence of helminth infection (82.6 and 84.8\%, respectively) than those housed in cage production systems (63.6\%). This may indicate the need for more rigorous control and prevention measures in free-range and backyard production systems using regular deworming coupled with access to early and accurate diagnosis allowing for early intervention.},

Hence the effects of these supplements on the gut microbiome are of great interest, and may clarify their mode of action, or explain heterogeneity in therapeutic responses. We conducted a systematic review of animal and human studies reporting the effects of GS or CS on gut microbial composition. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus databases for journal articles in English from database inception until July 2018, using search terms microbiome, microflora, intestinal microbiota/flora, gut microbiota/flora and glucosamine or chondroitin. Eight original articles reported the effects of GS or CS on microbiome composition in adult humans (four articles) or animals (four articles). Studies varied significantly in design, supplementation protocols, and microbiome assessment methods. There was moderate-quality evidence for an association between CS exposure and increased abundance of genus Bacteroides in the murine and human gut, and low-quality evidence for an association between CS exposure and an increase in Desulfovibrio piger species, an increase in Bacteroidales S24-7 family, and a decrease in Lactobacillus. We discuss the possible metabolic implications of these changes for the host. For GS, evidence of effects on gut microbiome was limited to one low-quality study. This review highlights the importance of considering the potential influence of oral CS supplements on gut microbiota when evaluating their effects and safety for the host.},

Studies were nominated for inclusion using an a priori defined protocol with preselected criteria, and studies were excluded from analysis if they did not include sufficient details about the exposure, dosimetry or experimental protocol, or if they lacked a sham-exposed group. Overall, 62 studies were identified that have investigated the effects of RF fields on spatial memory and place learning and have been published since 1993. Of these, 17 studies were excluded, 20 studies reported no significant field-related effects, 21 studies reported significant impairments or deficits, and four studies reported beneficial consequences. The data do not suggest whether these outcomes are related to specific differences in exposure or testing conditions, or simply represent chance. However, some studies have suggested possible molecular mechanisms for the observed effects, but none of these has been substantiated through independent replication. Further behavioural studies could prove useful to resolve this situation, and it is suggested that these studies should use a consistent animal model with standardized exposure and testing protocols, and with detailed dosimetry provided by heterogeneous, anatomically-realistic animal models.},

A number of multilevel random-effect meta-analysis models were fitted to estimate mean occurrence rate of antimicrobial-resistant thermotolerant Campylobacter and to compare them throughout the years and among the species, food-producing animals (i.e., bovine, pigs, broilers, hen, goat, and sheep), country of origin, sample type, methodology to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility, and the species of Campylobacter. Among the considered antibiotics, thermotolerant Campylobacter showed the highest resistance to tetracycline (pool estimate [PE] = 0.493; 95\% CI 0.466-0.519), nalidixic acid (PE = 0.385; 95\% CI 0.348-0.423), and ciprofloxacin (PE = 0.376; 95\% CI 0.339-0.415). In general, the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter spp. was higher in hen, broilers, and swine. Campylobacter coli showed a higher prevalence of antimicrobial resistance than Campylobacter jejuni. Independent of the antimicrobial evaluated, the disk diffusion method showed higher prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter than the methods based on the minimum inhibitory concentration estimation. The meta-analysis showed that the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant Campylobacter is relevant essentially in foods derived from hens and broilers, and it was observed worldwide. The prevalence of this pathogen is of public health importance and the increase in the prevalence of Campylobacter strains resistant to the antimicrobial of choice worsens the situation, hence, national authorities must monitor the situation in each country with the aim to establish the appropriate risk management measures.},

We reviewed articles indexed in PubMed, SCOPUS and Scientif Direct database with filter application. Included studies had to investigate local effects induced by Bothrops snake venom in any animal model using any type of photobiomodulation irradiation and at least one quantitative measure of local effects of Bothrops envenomation. Sixteen studies were selected from 54 original articles targeted PBMT (low-level laser or light emitting diode) as a complementary tool for local effects treatment induced by snakebites, and all its assessments. Articles were critically assessed by two independent raters with a structured tool for rating the research quality. PBMT demonstrate to be a promising tool for local treatment effects caused by snakebite by reducing local edema, hyperalgesia, leukocyte influx and myonecrosis and accelerating tissue regeneration related to myotoxicity.

METHOD: A systematic review of the literature in LILACS, PubMed and Science Direct databases. The articles were selected and evaluated for the level of evidence by the application of STROBE. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 12 articles. The application of the products occurred in surgical wounds, burns, infected wounds and gingival ulcers in laboratory animals, as well as in vitro tests, demonstrating that among other advantages, the nanoparticle-based dressings increased the healing speed, had good antibacterial capacity and were non cytotoxic agents. CONCLUSION: Based on the analyzed articles, it can be affirmed that dressings containing nanocomposites are quite promising and are shown as a great therapeutic option in wound healing.},

	abstract = {Current myocarditis guidelines do not advocate treatment to prevent myocardial injury and scar deposition in patients with myocarditis and normal left ventricular ejection fraction. We aimed to ascertain the utility of beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and antagonists of the renin-angiotensin system in ameliorating myocardial injury, scar formation and calcification in animal in vivo models of myocarditis. The project was prospectively registered with the PROSPERO database of systematic reviews (CRD42018089336). Primary outcomes (necrosis, fibrosis and calcification) were meta-analysed with random-effects modelling. 52 studies were systematically reviewed. Meta-analysis was performed compared with untreated controls. In each study, we identified all independent comparisons of treatment versus control groups. The pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) indicated treatment reduced necrosis by 16.9\% (71 controlled analyses, 95\% CI 13.2-20.7\%; P {\textless} 0.001), however there was less evidence of an effect after accounting for publication bias. Treatment led to a 12.8\% reduction in fibrosis (73 controlled analyses, 95\% CI 7.6-18.0\%; P {\textless} 0.001). After accounting for publication bias this was attenuated to 7.8\% but remained significant. Treatment reduced calcification by 4.1\% (28 controlled analyses, 95\% CI 0.2-8.0\%; P {\textless} 0.0395). We observed significant heterogeneity in effect size in all primary endpoints, which was predominantly driven by differences between drug categories. Beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors were the only agents that were effective for both necrosis and fibrosis, while only ACE inhibitors had a significant effect on calcification. This study provides evidence for a role for ACE inhibitors and beta blockers to prevent myocardial injury and scar deposition in in vivo models of myocarditis. There is a need for further well-designed studies to assess the translational application of these treatments.},

	abstract = {Mycobacterium ulcerans is the causative agent of Buruli ulcer, also known in Australia as Daintree ulcer or Bairnsdale ulcer. This destructive skin disease is characterized by extensive and painless necrosis of the skin and soft tissue with the formation of large ulcers, commonly on the leg or arm. To date, 33 countries with tropical, subtropical and temperate climates in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Western Pacific have reported cases of Buruli ulcer. The disease is rarely fatal, although it may lead to permanent disability and/or disfigurement if not treated appropriately or in time. It is the third most common mycobacterial infection in the world after tuberculosis and leprosy. The precise mode of transmission of M. ulcerans is yet to be elucidated. Nevertheless, it is possible that the mode of transmission varies with different geographical areas and epidemiological settings. The knowledge about the possible routes of transmission and potential animal reservoirs of M. ulcerans is poorly understood and still remains patchy. Infectious diseases arise from the interaction of agent, host and environment. The majority of emerging or remerging infectious disease in human populations is spread by animals: either wildlife, livestock or pets. Animals may act as hosts or reservoirs and subsequently spread the organism to the environment or directly to the human population. The reservoirs may or may not be the direct source of infection for the hosts; however, they play a major role in maintenance of the organism in the environment, and in the mode of transmission. This remains valid for M. ulcerans. Possums have been suggested as one of the reservoir of M. ulcerans in south-eastern Australia, where possums ingest M. ulcerans from the environment, amplify them and shed the organism through their faeces. We conducted a systematic review with selected key words on PubMed and INFORMIT databases to aggregate available published data on animal reservoirs of M. ulcerans around the world. After certain inclusion and exclusion criteria were implemented, a total of 17 studies was included in the review. A variety of animals around the world e.g., rodents, shrews, possums (ringtail and brushtail), horses, dogs, alpacas, koalas and Indian flap-shelled turtles have been recorded as being infected with M. ulcerans. The majority of studies included in this review identified animal reservoirs as predisposing to the emergence and reemergence of M. ulcerans infection. Taken together, from the selected studies in this systematic review, it is clear that exotic wildlife and native mammals play a significant role as reservoirs for M. ulcerans.},

Recent preclinical evidence implicates cannabinoids as powerful regulators of cell growth and differentiation, as well as potential anti-cancer agents. The aim of this review was to evaluate the effect of cannabinoids on in vivo prostate cancer models. The databases searched included PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science from inception to August 2020. Articles reporting on the effect of cannabinoids on prostate cancer were deemed eligible. We identified six studies that were all found to be based on in vivo/xenograft animal models. Results: In PC3 and DU145 xenografts, WIN55,212-2 reduced cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, in LNCaP xenografts, WIN55,212-2 reduced cell proliferation by 66-69\%. PM49, which is a synthetic cannabinoid quinone, was also found to result in a significant inhibition of tumor growth of up to 90\% in xenograft models of LNCaP and 40\% in xenograft models of PC3 cells, respectively. All studies have reported that the treatment of prostate cancers in in vivo/xenograft models with various cannabinoids decreased the size of the tumor, the outcomes of which depended on the dose and length of treatment. Within the limitation of these identified studies, cannabinoids were shown to reduce the size of prostate cancer tumors in animal models. However, further well-designed and controlled animal studies are warranted to confirm these findings.},

A database was designed based on published papers reporting the use of probiotics in laying hens.

The final database consisted of 47 in vivo studies with 190 treatment units. The statistical meta-analysis was performed according to the linear mixed models by using R software version 3.6.3. It was shown that dietary addition of probiotics linearly increased (P {\textless} 0.001) egg production and concomitantly decreased (P {\textless} 0.01) feed egg ratio (FER) with a linear pattern. Egg mass and feed intake were not associated with the probiotic treatment. Concerning egg quality parameters, probiotics did not affect egg weight but increased eggshell thickness (P {\textless} 0.001), eggshell weight (P {\textless} 0.01) and yolk colour (P {\textless} 0.01). Probiotics reduced (P {\textless} 0.05) cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol while elevated (P {\textless} 0.05) high-density lipoprotein cholesterol blood concentrations.

The present paper is the first systematic review that integrates evidence from animal and human trials regarding the possibility to condition the endocrine responses. Twenty-six animal and eight human studies were included in the review. We demonstrated that there is accumulating evidence that classical conditioning processes are able to influence specific endocrine responses, such as cortocosterone/cortisol and insulin, while more limited evidence exists for other hormones. Animal and human studies were generally consistent in their findings; however, the limited number of human studies makes it difficult to generalize and translate the results of animal research to humans. Next to methodological recommendations for future studies, we suggest several ways how classically conditioned endocrine responses can be used in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Arterial hyperoxia may induce vasoconstriction and reduce cardiac output, which is particularly undesirable in patients who already have compromised perfusion of vital organs. Due to the inaccessibility of vital organs in humans, vasoconstrictive effects of hyperoxia have primarily been studied in animal models. However, the results of these studies vary substantially. Here, we investigate the variation in magnitude of the hyperoxia effect among studies and explore possible sources of heterogeneity, such as vascular region and animal species. METHOD: Pubmed and Embase were searched for eligible studies up to November 2017. In vivo and ex vivo animal studies reporting on vascular tone changes induced by local or systemic normobaric hyperoxia were included. Experiments with co-interventions (e.g. disease or endothelium removal) or studies focusing on lung, brain or fetal vasculature or the ductus arteriosus were not included. We extracted data pertaining to species, vascular region, blood vessel characteristics and method of hyperoxia induction. Overall effect sizes were estimated with a standardized mean difference (SMD) random effects model. RESULTS: We identified a total of 60 studies, which reported data on 67 in vivo and 18 ex vivo experiments. In the in vivo studies, hyperoxia caused vasoconstriction with an SMD of - 1.42 (95\% CI - 1.65 to - 1.19). Ex vivo, the overall effect size was SMD - 0.56 (95\% CI - 1.09 to - 0.03). Between-study heterogeneity (I(2)) was high for in vivo (72\%, 95\% CI 62 to 85\%) and ex vivo studies (86\%, 95\% CI 78 to 98\%). In vivo, in comparison to the overall effect size, hyperoxic vasoconstriction was less pronounced in the intestines and skin (P = 0.03) but enhanced in the cremaster muscle region (P {\textless} 0.001). Increased constriction was seen in vessels 15-25 μm in diameter. Hyperoxic constriction appeared to be directly proportional to oxygen concentration. For ex vivo studies, heterogeneity could not be explained with subgroup analysis. CONCLUSION: The effect of hyperoxia on vascular tone is substantially higher in vivo than ex vivo. The magnitude of the constriction is most pronounced in vessels {\textasciitilde} 15-25 μm in diameter and is proportional to the level of hyperoxia. Relatively increased constriction was seen in muscle vasculature, while reduced constriction was seen in the skin and intestines.},

The objective of this study was to perform a systematic review to assess the evidence available relating to the question "In Thoroughbred Racehorses with naturally occurring joint disease, what is known about the safety of intraarticular medications in horses?" A systematic review was carried out, and 537 articles were identified; 17 were identified for qualitative analysis. This study aims to allow equine veterinary practitioners to assess the available literature for evidence of the potential complications from intraarticular use of corticosteroids in horses. A search strategy was formulated to identify available evidence on the safety of intraarticular corticosteroids in Thoroughbred racehorses. Studies were retrieved from literature search engines, and titles and abstracts were screened for full text inclusion. Studies with the highest evidence quality underwent qualitative analysis with a standardized questionnaire. The results show that there are multiple studies that look at the effect of intraarticular medications from experimental animals, but there are few studies of the highest quality of evidence that address clinical scenarios. Two cohort studies have explored some issues around intraarticular medications. In conclusion, practitioners should be aware that the use of intraarticular corticosteroids may be associated with negative consequences. Only a selection of articles was available, therefore the review is at risk of selection bias associated with the articles that are selected from the literature. An application of this study is it should inform equine practitioners over the status of the current literature on the use of corticosteroids in Thoroughbred racehorses.},

	abstract = {The worldwide population of domestic dogs is estimated at approximately 700 million, with around 75\% classified as "free-roaming". Where free-roaming dogs exist in high densities, there are significant implications for public health, animal welfare, and wildlife. Approaches to manage dog populations include culling, fertility control, and sheltering. Understanding the effectiveness of each of these interventions is important in guiding future dog population management. We present the results of a systematic review of published studies investigating dog population management, to assess: (1) where and when studies were carried out; (2) what population management methods were used; and (3) what was the effect of the method. We evaluated the reporting quality of the published studies for strength of evidence assessment. The systematic review resulted in a corpus of 39 papers from 15 countries, reporting a wide disparity of approaches and measures of effect. We synthesised the management methods and reported effects. Fertility control was most investigated and had the greatest reported effect on dog population size. Reporting quality was low for power calculations (11\%), sample size calculations (11\%), and the use of control populations (17\%). We provide recommendations for future studies to use common metrics and improve reporting quality, study design, and modelling approaches in order to allow better assessment of the true impact of dog population management.},

Various approaches to vaccination against the major viral pathogens have been investigated, including timing. It is thought that beef cattle entering feedlots may not be able to adequately respond to vaccination due to the stresses of shipping and processing. A meta-analysis was performed to compare the effectiveness of on-arrival vaccination to vaccination delayed 7 or more days following arrival, using a modified-live viral (MLV) vaccine against bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), parainfluenza-3 (PI3), and bovine viral diarrhea types 1 and 2 (BVD 1 and 2), on outcomes of BRD morbidity, retreatment risk, and mortality. Eight studies were identified comparing vaccination timing in feedlot cattle via literature search. Mantel-Haenzsel risk ratios were calculated for each outcome, and Forest plots were constructed. In the studies identified, there was no difference in BRD morbidity risk, retreatment risk, or BRD mortality between calves vaccinated at arrival or delayed. Based on the data from the studies analyzed, it would not appear that there is an advantage or disadvantage in terms or morbidity, retreatment risk, or mortality in delaying vaccination.},

	abstract = {Development of ketosis in high-producing dairy cows contributes to several animal health issues and highlights the need for a better understanding of the genetic basis of metabolic diseases. To evaluate the pattern of differential gene expression in the liver of cows under negative energy balance (NEB), and under subclinical and clinical ketosis, a meta-analysis of gene expression and genome-wide association studies results was performed. An initial systematic review identified 118 articles based on the key words "cow," "liver," "negative energy balance," "ketosis," "expression," "qPCR," "microarray," "proteomic," "RNA-Seq," and "GWAS." After further screening for only peer-reviewed and pertinent articles for gene expression during NEB and clinical and subclinical ketosis (considering plasma levels of β-hydroxybutyrate), 20 articles were included in the analysis. From the systematic review, 430 significant SNPs identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were assigned to genes reported in gene expression studies by considering chromosome and base pair positions in the ARS-UCD 1.2 bovine assembly. Venn diagrams were created to integrate the data obtained in the systematic review, and Gene Ontology enrichment analysis was carried out using official gene names. A QTL enrichment analysis was also performed to identify potential positional candidate loci. Twenty-four significant SNPs were located within the coordinates of differentially expressed genes located on chromosomes 2, 3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 27, and 29. Three significant metabolic pathways were associated with NEB and subclinical and clinical ketosis. In addition, 2 important genes, PPARA (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha) and ACACA (acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase α), were identified, which were differentially expressed in the 3 metabolic conditions. The PPARA gene is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism and fatty liver disease and the ACACA gene encodes an enzyme that catalyzes the carboxylation of acetyl-coenzyme A to malonyl-coenzyme A, which is a rate-limiting step in fatty acid synthesis. Gene network analysis revealed co-expression interactions among 34 genes associated with functions involving fatty acid transport and fatty acid metabolism. For the annotated QTL, 9 QTL were identified for ketosis. The genes FN1 (fibronectin 1) and PTK2 (protein tyrosine kinase 2), which are mainly involved in cell adhesion and formation of extracellular matrix constituents, were enriched for QTL previously associated with the trait "ketosis" on chromosome 2 and for the trait "milk iron content" on chromosome 14, respectively. This integration of gene expression and GWAS data provides an additional understanding of the genetic background of NEB and subclinical and clinical ketosis in dairy cattle. Thus, it is a useful approach to identify biological mechanisms underlying these metabolic conditions in dairy cattle.},

Although the economic costs and public health safety risks associated with the disease are considerable, the overall epidemiology of the Chinese yak (Bos grunniens) bTB is unclear. To fully reveal the basic prevalence of yak bTB in different regions of China, we searched five databases including PubMed, Science Direct, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), Wanfang and Chongqing VIP. Based on the incidence and prevalence of yak tuberculosis in China from 1982 to 2020, a meta-analysis of yak bTB in China was established for the first time. By formulating the search formula, 97 studies were searched in five databases. According to the established exclusion criteria and excluded comments and repeated and irrelevance research, we finally selected 19 cross-sectional studies, which showed the prevalence of bTB in Chinese yaks. Random-effect meta-regression model analysis showed that the estimated prevalence of 122,729 yaks in China was 1.0 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.0-1.0). The regional prevalence varies greatly, northwest China prevalence rate 0. 39\% (95\% CI: 0.2-0. 64) and southwest China prevalence rate 2.59\% (95\% CI: 1.94-3.34); in terms of province level, the prevalence was highest in Tibet 2.59\% (95\% CI: 1.94-3.34), followed by Xinjiang 2.36\% (95\% CI: 0.86-4.58), and Shanxi has the lowest 0.00\% (95\% CI: 0.00-0.98). This systematic review and meta-analysis identified the estimated prevalence of bTB in Chinese yaks and estimated the underlying factors associated with bTB, including geographic location, sampling year, age, and TB detection method.

The current systematic review and meta-analysis was planned to determine the status of fasciolosis among domestic ruminants, including cattle, buffalo, goat, and sheep at the industrial slaughterhouses in Iran, between the years 2000 and 2016. Eight databases, four English and four Persian, were searched. Our findings demonstrated that 2.6\% of all inspected livers of slaughtered ruminants were infected with Fasciola spp. during 2000–2016. The mean prevalence of fasciolosis for cattle, buffalo, goat, and sheep was 21\%, 4.2\%, 2\%, and 2.4\%, respectively. Additionally, most studies were performed on cattle 25 (39.6\%), sheep 24 (38 \%), and goat 12 (19\%), respectively, and just 2 (3.1\%) studies were performed on buffalo. The prevalence of animal fasciolosis has significantly decreased among domestic ruminants in Iran except for cattle. In addition, the prevalence of this disease in Northern and Western regions of the country has remained at hypo-endemic level. The results present updated gathered information on the epidemiology of fasciolosis in domestic ruminants in Iran, and will expand the screening strategies to improve health and reduce economic impacts among farm animals.},

Thirty-eight articles were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Totally, 5093 cattle, 1958 sheep, and 1232 goats corresponding to prevalence of Anaplasma infection from different areas of Iran were examined. The total prevalence of Anaplasma infection was estimated to be 34\% (95\% CI 27\%, 41\%) in domestic ruminants. Based on our data, Khozestan (54\%) and Khorasan Razavi (46\%) provinces were the most prevalent areas in Iran and Kerman (3\%) and Hamedan (1\%) provinces are the lowest. The highest prevalence of Anaplasma spp. infection was belonged to A. ovis (44\%) and the lowest to A. phagocytophilum (1\%) with a significant difference among them (p {\textless} .001). In addition, the most common diagnostic tests were PCR (54\%), microscopy (35\%) and ELISA (7\%) assays. The high prevalence of ovine and bovine anaplasmosis in Iran, confirms the stability situations of animal anaplasmosis in the studied regions particularly northeastern and southwestern parts of the country. Our data offer valuable and encouraging information as regards the current situation of anaplasmosis in domestic livestock in Iran, which might be useful for active and passive surveillance and preventing plans.},

This systematic review was conducted to summarize effects of the consumption of fortified dairy products on biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk. MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases were used to perform searches to include studies published up to 30 April 2018. Randomized clinical trials with human subjects consuming dairy products fortified with phytosterols, FAs, vitamins or minerals and relating this consumption with cardiometabolic health were included in this review. Risk of bias assessment according to Cochrane guidelines was performed to determine the quality of the trials. Forty-one studies were finally selected for this synthesis; the selected studies tested dairy products fortified with the following nutrients and bioactive components: phytosterols (n = 31), FAs (n = 8), and vitamin D (n = 2). We found that the consumption of phytosterol-fortified dairy, led to an overall LDL cholesterol reduction of -0.36 (-0.41, -0.31) mmol/L, P {\textless} 0.001; this decrease was mainly related to the dosage. Likewise, consumption of ω-3 FA-fortified dairy products resulted in a plasma LDL cholesterol reduction of -0.18 (-0.27, -0.09) mmol/L as well as a decrease of -0.18 (-0.32, -0.05) mmol/L in triacylglycerols (TG). Performing meta-analyses of the consumption of dairy products fortified with vitamin D or FAs other than ω-3 FAs and biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk was not possible because of the few available publications. Our results indicate that consumption of dairy products fortified with phytosterols and ω-3 FAs can lead to a reduction of LDL cholesterol and consumption of fortified dairy products fortified with ω-3 FAs can reduce TG concentration. However, more studies with homogeneous designs are needed to determine the advantages of using dairy products as fortification vehicles to prevent cardiometabolic risk.},

The use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in the health sector is propitious and has been adopted by human and animal health professionals as an important tool in spatial analyses of health. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review on the geoprocessing and spatial analysis techniques adopted for mapping risk areas of human and animal leptospirosis. The articles were collected on scientific platforms by entering the following terms: SIG/GIS, leptospirose/leptospirosis, area de risco/risk area and distribuicao espacial/spatial distribution, and included in the study if they met the following criteria: a) publication in the period from 1998 to 2017; b) identification of risk areas and/or spatial distribution of leptospirosis as one of the research topics; and c) application of GIS in the methodology. As a result, we found 40 articles, published by 15 different countries, which adopted GIS for the spatial analysis and identification of risk areas of leptospirosis. Among these, only 45\% (18) conducted an spatial statistical analysis. Brazil and USA had the highest numbers of publications, 16 and 7 articles, respectively. From 2007, the use of GIS and spatial analysis techniques, applied to the theme of this study, have been intensified and diversified, and 93\% of the articles elected for this review were published from 2007 to 2017. The results point to a progressive interest of health professionals in applying these techniques for monitoring and conducting epidemiological analyses of leptospirosis, besides indicating a greater need for intersectoral integration between health professionals and others, in the use of spatial analysis and GIS techniques.},

	abstract = {Although leucocytes are targets of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) effector molecules and RAS-modulating drugs exert immunomodulatory effects, their impact on Trypanosoma cruzi infection remains poorly understood. By using the framework of a systematic review, we integrated the preclinical and clinical evidence to investigate the relevance of angiotensin-inhibiting drugs on T. cruzi infections. From a comprehensive and structured search in biomedical databases, only original studies were analysed. In preclinical and clinical studies, captopril, enalapril and losartan were RAS-modulating drugs used. The main in vitro findings indicated that these drugs increased parasite uptake per host cells, IL-12 expression by infected dendritic cells and IFN-P by T lymphocytes, in addition to attenuating IL-10 and IL-17 production by CD8 + T cells. In animal models, reduced parasitaemia, tissue parasitism, leucocytes infiltration and mortality were often observed in T. cruzi-infected animals receiving RAS-modulating drugs. In patients with Chagas' disease, these drugs exerted a controversial impact on cytokine and hormone levels, and a limited effect on cardiovascular function. Considering a detailed evaluation of reporting and methodological quality, the current preclinical and clinical evidence is at high risk of bias, and we hope that our critical analysis will be useful in mitigating the risk of bias in further studies.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140795},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-cholera Vibrio bacteria are a major cause of foodborne illness in the United States. Raw oysters are commonly implicated in gastroenteritis caused by pathogenic Vibrio parahaemolyticus. In response to outbreaks in 1997-1998, the US Food and Drug Administration developed a nation-wide quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) of V. parahaemolyticus in raw oysters in 2005. The QMRA identified information gaps that new research may address. Incidence of sporadic V. parahaemolyticus illness has recently increased and, as oyster consumption increases and sea temperatures rise, V. parahaemolyticus outbreaks may become more frequent, posing health concerns. Updated and region-specific QMRAs will improve the accuracy and precision of risk of infection estimates. OBJECTIVES: We identify research to support an updated QMRA of V. parahaemolyticus from oysters harvested in Chesapeake Bay and Puget Sound, focusing on observational and experimental research on post-harvest practices (PHPs) published from 2004 to 2019. METHODS: A predefined search strategy was applied to PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Science.gov, NAL Agricola, and Google Scholar. Study eligibility criteria were defined using a population, intervention, comparator, and outcome statement. Reviewers independently coded abstracts for inclusion/exclusion using predefined criteria. Data were extracted and study quality and relevance evaluated based on published guidance for food safety risk assessments. Findings were synthesized using a weight of evidence approach. RESULTS: Of 12,174 articles retrieved, 93 were included for full-text review. Twenty-seven studies were found to be high quality and high relevance, including studies on cold storage, high hydrostatic pressure, depuration, and disinfectant, and other PHPs. High hydrostatic pressure consistently emerged as the most effective PHP in reducing abundance of V. parahaemolyticus. DISCUSSION: Limitations of the knowledge base and review approach involve the type and quantity of data reported. Future research should focus on PHPs for which few or no high quality and high relevance studies exist, such as irradiation and relaying.},

	abstract = {The Bacterial Endotoxin Test (BET) is a method for exclusion of endotoxin-related pyrogen contamination in pharmaceutical products, as an alternative to the Rabbit Pyrogen Test (RPT). However, BET does not detect a broad range of biologically relevant pyrogens, and interferences can limit its practical use for different medical products. This work aimed to scope the evidence in the scientific literature for case-by-case validity assessments of BET in different uses for medical products. A search strategy was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science in April 2020, according to the PRISMA-ScR statement. Twenty-two references were included, evaluating medical products for endotoxin contamination through both BET and RPT according to standardized protocols. A critical appraisal was performed through ToxRTool, followed by data extraction and qualitative synthesis of outcomes and methodological issues. Four classes of products assessed by BET were identified, including nanoparticles, drugs, blood and biological products. A considerable variation was observed on the BET methods used. Collectively, the evidence indicates different factors influencing the outcome of BET, including the chemical nature of samples that may cause interference depending on the selected method. While some applications to medical products appear adequate, others, such as nanoparticles, may require the use of different in vitro pyrogen testing methods, reinforcing the need for case-by-case validation for each BET method and type of medical product.},

	abstract = {The discovery of antibiotics brought with it many advances in the health and well-being of humans and animals; however, in recent years development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has increasingly become a concern. Much of the antibiotic use on dairy farms is for disease management in mature cattle, and AMR in fecal organisms is relatively rare in this group. However, young dairy calves often carry high levels of AMR in their fecal Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, which could provide a potential reservoir of AMR genes on dairy farms. To develop practical and effective antibiotic stewardship policies for dairy calf rearing, it is vital to have a solid understanding of the current state of knowledge regarding AMR in these animals. A systematic review process was used to summarize the current scientific literature regarding AMR in fecal S. enterica and E. coli and associations between management practices and AMR prevalence in dairy calves in the United States and Canada. Seven online databases were searched for literature published from 1997 to 2018. Multiple studies indicated an association between preweaned calves and increased risk of fecal shedding of resistant bacteria, compared to other animal groups on dairy farms. There also was evidence, although less consistent, of an impact of antibiotic treatment, antibiotic-containing milk replacer feeding, and feeding nonsalable or waste milk (WM) on the presence of AMR bacteria. Overall, the research summarized in this systematic review highlights the need for continued research on the impact of management practices, including antibiotic use, WM feeding, and disease prevention practices in reducing AMR in E. coli and S. enterica in dairy calves. In addition, few data were available on physiological and microbiological factors that may contribute to the high relative populations of resistant bacteria in young calves, suggesting another valuable area of future research.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVERiluzole is a glutamatergic modulator that has recently shown potential for neuroprotection after spinal cord injury (SCI). While the effects of riluzole are extensively documented in animal models of SCI, there remains heterogeneity in findings. Moreover, there is a paucity of data on the pharmacology of riluzole and its effects in humans. For the present study, the authors systematically reviewed the literature to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of riluzole in SCI.METHODSThe PubMed database was queried from 1996 to September 2018 to identify animal studies and clinical trials involving riluzole administration for SCI. Once articles were identified, they were processed for year of publication, study design, subject type, injury model, number of subjects in experimental and control groups, dose, timing/route of administration, and outcomes.RESULTSA total of 37 studies were included in this study. Three placebo-controlled clinical trials were included with a total of 73 patients with a mean age of 39.1 years (range 18-70 years). For the clinical trials included within this study, the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale distributions for SCI were 42.6\% grade A, 25\% grade B, 26.6\% grade C, and 6.2\% grade D. Key findings from studies in humans included decreased nociception, improved motor function, and attenuated spastic reflexes. Twenty-six animal studies (24 in vivo, 1 in vitro, and 1 including both in vivo and in vitro) were included. A total of 520 animals/in vitro specimens were exposed to riluzole and 515 animals/in vitro specimens underwent other treatment for comparison. The average dose of riluzole for intraperitoneal, in vivo studies was 6.5 mg/kg (range 1-10 mg/kg). Key findings from animal studies included behavioral improvement, histopathological tissue sparing, and modified electrophysiology after SCI. Eight studies examined the pharmacology of riluzole in SCI. Key findings from pharmacological studies included riluzole dose-dependent effects on glutamate uptake and its modified bioavailability after SCI in both animal and clinical models.CONCLUSIONSSCI has many negative sequelae requiring neuroprotective intervention. While still relatively new in its applications for SCI, both animal and human studies demonstrate riluzole to be a promising pharmacological intervention to attenuate the devastating effects of this condition.},

	abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a chronic disease of cattle that impacts productivity and represents a major public health threat. Despite the considerable economic costs and zoonotic risk consequences associated with the disease, accurate estimates of bTB prevalence are lacking in many countries, including India, where national control programmes are not yet implemented and the disease is considered endemic. To address this critical knowledge gap, we performed a systematic review of the literature and a meta-analysis to estimate bTB prevalence in cattle in India and provide a foundation for the future formulation of rational disease control strategies and the accurate assessment of economic and health impact risks. The literature search was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and identified 285 cross-sectional studies on bTB in cattle in India across four electronic databases and handpicked publications. Of these, 44 articles were included, contributing a total of 82,419 cows and buffaloes across 18 states and one union territory in India. Based on a random-effects (RE) meta-regression model, the analysis revealed a pooled prevalence estimate of 7.3\% (95\% CI: 5.6, 9.5), indicating that there may be an estimated 21.8 million (95\% CI: 16.6, 28.4) infected cattle in India-a population greater than the total number of dairy cows in the United States. The analyses further suggest that production system, species, breed, study location, diagnostic technique, sample size and study period are likely moderators of bTB prevalence in India and need to be considered when developing future disease surveillance and control programmes. Taken together with the projected increase in intensification of dairy production and the subsequent increase in the likelihood of zoonotic transmission, the results of our study suggest that attempts to eliminate tuberculosis from humans will require simultaneous consideration of bTB control in cattle population in countries such as India.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.virusres.2019.197725},
	abstract = {African swine fever (ASF) was first described in 1921 as a highly fatal and contagious disease which caused severe outbreaks among settlers' pigs in British East Africa. Since then the disease has expanded its geographical distribution and is currently present in large parts of Africa, Europe and Asia and considered a global threat. Although ASF is typically associated with very high case fatality rates, a certain proportion of infected animals will recover from the infection and survive. Early on it was speculated that such survivors may act as carriers of the virus, and the importance of such carries for disease persistence and spread has since then almost become an established truth. However, the scientific basis for such a role of carriers may be questioned. With this in mind, the objective of this study was to review the available literature in a systematic way and to evaluate the available scientific evidence. The selection of publications for the review was based on a database search, followed by a stepwise screening process in order to exclude duplicates and non-relevant publications based on pre-defined exclusion criteria. By this process the number of publications finally included was reduced from the 3664 hits identified in the initial database search to 39 publications, from which data was then extracted and analysed. Based on this it was clear that a definition of an ASF virus carrier is lacking, and that in general any survivor or seropositive animal has been referred to as carrier. It was also clear that evidence of any significant role of such a carrier is absent. Two types of "survivors" could be defined: 1) pigs that do not die but develop a persistent infection, characterised by periodic viraemia and often but not always accompanied by some signs of subacute to chronic disease, and 2) pigs which clear the infection independently of virulence of the virus, and which are not persistently infected and will not present with prolonged virus excretion. There is no evidence that suggests that any of these categories of survivors can be considered as "healthy" carriers, i.e. pigs that show no sign of disease but can transmit the virus to in-contact pigs. However, localized virus persistence in lymphoid tissues may occur to some extent in any of the categories of survivors, which in theory may cause infection after oral uptake. To what extent this is relevant in reality, however, can be questioned given the virus dose generally needed for oral infection.},

	abstract = {The choice of animal-based traits to identify and deal with production diseases is often a challenge for pig farmers, researchers and other related professionals. This systematic review focused on production diseases, that is, the diseases that arise from management practices, affecting the digestive, locomotory and respiratory system of pigs. The aim was to classify all traits that have been measured and conduct a meta-analysis to quantify the impact of diseases on these traits so that these can be used as indicators for intervention. Data were extracted from 67 peer-reviewed publications selected from 2339 records. Traits were classified as productive (performance and carcass composition), behavioural, biochemical and molecular traits. A meta-analysis based on mixed models was performed on traits assessed more than five times across studies, using the package metafor of the R software. A total of 524 unique traits were recorded 1 to 31 times in a variety of sample material including blood, muscle, articular cartilage, bone or at the level of whole animal. No behavioural traits were recorded from the included experiments. Only 14 traits were measured on more than five occasions across studies. Traits within the biochemical, molecular and productive trait groups were reported most frequently in the published literature and were most affected by production diseases; among these were some cytokines (interleukin (IL) 1-β, IL6, IL8 and tumour necrosis factor-α), acute phase proteins (haptoglobin) and daily weight gain. Quantification of the influence of factors relating to animal characteristics or husbandry practices was not possible, due to the low frequency of reporting throughout the literature. To conclude, this study has permitted a holistic assessment of traits measured in the published literature to study production diseases occurring in various stages of the production cycle of pigs. It shows the lack of consensus and common measurements of traits to characterise production diseases within the scientific literature. Specific traits, most of them relating to performance characteristics or immunological response of pigs, are proposed for further study as potential tools for the prognosis and study of production diseases.},

	abstract = {Background: To understand brain function in health and disease, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used in rodent models. Because animals need to be immobilised for image acquisition, fMRI is commonly performed under anaesthesia. The choice of anaesthetic protocols and may affect fMRI readouts, either directly or via changing physiological balance, and thereby threaten the scientific validity of fMRI in rodents. Methods: The present study systematically reviewed the literature investigating the influence of different anaesthesia regimes and changes in physiological parameters as confounders of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI in rats and mice. Four databases were searched, studies selected according to pre-defined criteria, and risk of bias assessed for each study. Results are reported in two separate articles; this part of the review focuses on effects of changes in physiological parameters. Results: A total of 121 publications was included, of which 49 addressed effects of changes in physiological parameters. Risk of bias was high in all included studies. Blood oxygenation [arterial partial pressure of oxygen (p(a)O(2))], ventilation [arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (p(a)CO(2))] and arterial blood pressure affected BOLD fMRI readouts across various experimental paradigms. Conclusions: Blood oxygenation, ventilation and arterial blood pressure should be monitored and maintained at stable physiological levels throughout experiments. Appropriate anaesthetic management and monitoring are crucial to obtain scientifically valid, reproducible results from fMRI studies in rodent models.},

In the present systematic review, literature analyzing in rats and mice the influence of anesthesia regimes and concurrent physiological functions on blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI results was investigated. Studies from four databases that were searched were selected following pre-defined criteria. Two separate articles publish the results; the herewith presented article includes the analyses of 83 studies. Most studies found differences in BOLD fMRI readouts with different anesthesia drugs and dose rates, time points of imaging or when awake status was compared to anesthetized animals. To obtain scientifically valid, reproducible results from rodent fMRI studies, stable levels of anesthesia with agents suitable for the model under investigation as well as known and objectively quantifiable effects on readouts are, thus, mandatory. Further studies should establish dose ranges for standardized anesthetic protocols and determine time windows for imaging during which influence of anesthesia on readout is objectively quantifiable.},

	abstract = {Understanding the non-human reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens is critical for effective disease control, but identifying the relative contributions of the various reservoirs of multi-host pathogens is challenging. For Ross River virus (RRV), knowledge of the transmission dynamics, in particular the role of non-human species, is important. In Australia, RRV accounts for the highest number of human mosquito-borne virus infections. The long held dogma that marsupials are better reservoirs than placental mammals, which are better reservoirs than birds, deserves critical review. We present a review of 50 years of evidence on non-human reservoirs of RRV, which includes experimental infection studies, virus isolation studies and serosurveys. We find that whilst marsupials are competent reservoirs of RRV, there is potential for placental mammals and birds to contribute to transmission dynamics. However, the role of these animals as reservoirs of RRV remains unclear due to fragmented evidence and sampling bias. Future investigations of RRV reservoirs should focus on quantifying complex transmission dynamics across environments.},

However, current literature on the use of analgesics in sheep generally focuses on an industry or farm level of use. This structured review evaluates use and efficacy of analgesics administered to sheep in a biomedical research setting. Electronic databases were searched with terms related to analgesia in research sheep. After application of exclusion criteria, 29 peer-reviewed publications were evaluated from 1995 to 2018. Drugs used for analgesia in sheep include opioids, α₂ agonists, NSAID, local anesthetics, NMDA receptor antagonists, and calcium channel blockers. Opioid agonists have previously been considered short acting and of questionable efficacy in sheep, but newer modalities may provide effective analgesia. NSAID may exhibit an analgesic effect only when inflammatory pain is present and may not be beneficial for use in acute pain models. α₂ agonists provide effective yet short-lived analgesia; however, side effects are of concern. Local anesthetics were previously widely used as stand-alone agents, as alternatives to the use of general anesthetics in sheep. These agents have since fallen out of favor as sole agents. Despite this, they provide a valuable analgesic effect when used as adjuncts to general anesthetic regimes. The NMDA antagonist ketamine provided good analgesia and is likely underutilized as an analgesic agent in sheep. Future controlled studies should further evaluate the analgesic properties of ketamine in sheep.},

This study was performed to analyse the epidemiological data on taeniosis and cysticercosis in Serbia for the period 1990-2018. METHODS: Data on cases of T. saginata and T. solium infection were collected via a systematic search of published articles, the grey literature, and official reports, as well as by performing clinical observational studies of patients treated in the departments for infectious diseases of hospitals and university clinics in Serbia. RESULTS: A total of 212 cases of taeniosis were reported, all between 1997 and 2004 when taeniosis was notifiable (incidence range 0.04-0.9/100 000 population/year). From 1990 to 2018, 170 cases of cysticercosis (all but one of neurocysticercosis), were registered (incidence range 0-0.29/100 000 population/year), with a strong decrease since 2000 and a single case in the last 9 years. The annual number of cases of both taeniosis (Pearson's r = 0.914, p =  0.001) and cysticercosis (Pearson's r = 0.582, p = 0.014) correlated with the consumer price index. CONCLUSIONS: In Serbia, T. saginata and T. solium infections are autochthonous but occur only sporadically.

Fifty-three different infectious agents, all with zoonotic potential, were reported to be carried by commensal rats; 48 by the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) and 20 by the black rat (R. rattus). There was a tendency for rural areas to harbour more rat-borne microbes than urban areas regarding the brown rat, but the opposite could be observed for the black rat. The study clearly indicated that an improved surveillance on wild rats is needed in Europe, and further indicated the pathogens and geographical areas where the major focus is required. For example, six zoonotic microbes seemed to be clearly more geographically widespread in Europe than others; virulent or resistant E. coli, pathogenic Leptospira spp., Hymenolepis diminuta, H. nana, Capillaria hepatica and Toxoplasma gondii.},

During reoperations, the need for adhesiolysis results in increased operative time and a more complicated convalescence. In pre-clinical evaluation, adhesion barriers are tested for their efficacy in preventing 'de novo' adhesion formation, However, it is unknown to which extent barriers are tested for prevention of adhesion reformation. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the efficacy of commercially available adhesion barriers and laparoscopic adhesiolysis in preventing adhesion reformation in animal models. Pubmed and EMBASE were searched for studies which assessed peritoneal adhesion reformation after a standardized peritoneal injury (in the absence of an intra-peritoneal mesh), and reported the incidence of adhesions, or an adhesion score as outcome. Ninety-three studies were included. No study met the criteria for low risk of bias. None of the commercially available adhesion barriers significantly reduced the incidence of adhesion reformation. Three commercially available adhesion barriers reduced the adhesion score of reformed adhesions, namely Seprafilm (SMD 1.38[95\% CI]; p {\textless} 0.01), PEG (SMD 2.08[95\% CI]; p {\textless} 0.01) and Icodextrin (SMD 1.85[95\% CI]; p {\textless} 0.01). There was no difference between laparoscopic or open adhesiolysis with regard to the incidence of adhesion reformation (RR 1.14[95\% CI]; p ≥ 0.05) or the adhesion score (SMD 0.92[95\% CI]; p ≥ 0.05). Neither currently commercially available adhesion barriers, nor laparoscopic adhesiolysis without using an adhesion barrier, reduces the incidence of adhesion reformation in animal models.

MATERIALS \& METHODS: Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science) were searched up to December 2019. Studies assessing the impact of PTH administration in experimental periodontitis in rodents have been identified. RESULTS: Amongst the 247 identified articles, 10 met the inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. Experimental periodontitis was mainly induced by ligature placement or surgically with a dental bur. All studies considered bone healing after PTH administration at different frequencies as primary outcome. Results showed that an intermittent administration of PTH promoted bone healing and neovascularization. Nevertheless, a decrease of soft tissue inflammation was also observed. CONCLUSION: Intermittent administration of PTH appears to enhance significantly periodontal healing and to promote alveolar bone regeneration. However, due to the risk of side effects, the development of scaffolds allowing its local and time-controlled delivery is of importance.},

The aim of this study was to provide a systematic overview of externally validated and commercially available PLF technologies, which could be used for sensor-based welfare assessment in dairy cattle. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a systematic literature review was conducted to identify externally validated sensor technologies. Out of 1,111 publications initially extracted from databases, only 42 studies describing 30 tools (including prototypes) met requirements for external validation. Moreover, through market search, 129 different retailed technologies with application for animal-based welfare assessment were identified. In total, only 18 currently retailed sensors have been externally validated (14\%). The highest validation rate was found for systems based on accelerometers (30\% of tools available on the market have validation records), while the lower rates were obtained for cameras (10\%), load cells (8\%), miscellaneous milk sensors (8\%), and boluses (7\%). Validated traits concerned animal activity, feeding and drinking behavior, physical condition, and health of animals. The majority of tools were validated on adult cows. Non-active behavior (lying and standing) and rumination were the most often validated for the high performance. Regarding active behavior (e.g., walking), lower performance of tools was reported. Also, tools used for physical condition (e.g., body condition scoring) and health evaluation (e.g., mastitis detection) were classified in lower performance group. The precision and accuracy of feeding and drinking assessment varied depending on measured trait and used sensor. Regarding relevance for animal-based welfare assessment, several validated technologies had application for good health (e.g., milk quality sensors) and good feeding (e.g., load cells, accelerometers). Accelerometers-based systems have also practical relevance to assess good housing. However, currently available PLF technologies have low potential to assess appropriate behavior of dairy cows. To increase actors' trust toward the PLF technology and prompt sensor-based welfare assessment, validation studies, especially in commercial herds, are needed. Future research should concentrate on developing and validating PLF technologies dedicated to the assessment of appropriate behavior and tools dedicated to monitoring the health and welfare in calves and heifers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease characterized by widespread loss of the pulmonary microcirculation and elevated pulmonary arterial pressures leading to pathological right ventricular remodeling and ultimately right heart failure. Regenerative cell therapies could potentially restore the effective lung microcirculation and provide a curative therapy for PAH. The objective of this systematic review was to compare the efficacy of regenerative cell therapies in preclinical models of PAH. METHODS: A systematic search strategy was developed and executed. We included preclinical animal studies using regenerative cell therapy in experimental models of PAH. Primary outcomes were right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP). The secondary outcome was right ventricle/left ventricle + septum weight ratio (RV/LV+S). Pooled effect sizes were undertaken using random effects inverse variance models. Risk of bias and publication bias were assessed. RESULTS: The systematic search yielded 1285 studies, of which 44 met eligibility criteria. Treatment with regenerative cell therapy was associated with decreased RVSP (SMD - 2.10; 95\% CI - 2.59 to - 1.60), mPAP (SMD - 2.16; 95\% CI - 2.97 to - 1.35), and RV/LV+S (SMD - 1.31, 95\% CI - 1.64 to - 0.97). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that cell modification resulted in greater reduction in RVSP. The effects on RVSP and mPAP remained statistically significant even after adjustment for publication bias. The majority of studies had an unclear risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Preclinical studies of regenerative cell therapy demonstrated efficacy in animal models of PAH; however, future studies should consider incorporating design elements to reduce the risk of bias.

	abstract = {Chamydia species are bacterial pathogens that can infect a wide range of animal hosts including humans. In birds, Chlamydia psittaci is a leading cause of chlamydial infections (avian chlamydiosis) and is a zoonotic pathogen causing human psittacosis. The objectives of this study were to estimate the global prevalence of chlamydial infections in birds, to assess heterogeneity of the prevalence for some particular characteristics (continents, bird orders, specimen types, and diagnostic techniques), and to determine the trend of the prevalence over time. The relevant citations on the prevalence of chlamydial infections in birds were retrieved from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Titles and abstracts of the retrieved citations were screened for possible eligibility. Then, full-texts of eligible articles were assessed for data extraction. A random effects model was used for estimating the global prevalence of chlamydial infections in birds and for all other meta-analyses. Subgroup meta-analysis was used to assess heterogeneity of the prevalence for the characteristics mentioned above. Meta-regression analysis and cumulative meta-analysis were used to determine the trend of the prevalence over time. The quality of each included study was also evaluated. Of 579 citations, 74 studies (a total of 39,225 bird samples from 26 countries, five continents) were included in meta-analysis. Almost all included studies reported birds with C. psittaci infections. The global prevalence of chlamydial infections in birds was 19.5 \% (95 \% CI, 16.3 \%-23.1 \%). No significant differences of the prevalence were observed among continents, the prevalence ranged from 16.5 \% (95 \% CI, 9.8 \%-26.5 \%) in South America to 21.7 \% (95 \% CI, 12.1 \%-35.9 \%) in North America. No significant differences of the prevalence were observed among bird orders, the prevalence ranged from 13.4 \% (95 \% CI, 7.0 \%-23.9 \%) in Passeriformes to 32.0 \% (95 \% CI, 20.6 \%-46.1 \%) in Galliformes. No significant differences of the prevalence were observed between specimen types; the prevalence was 18.4 \% (95 \% CI, 15.2 \%-22.2 \%) for live specimens and 26.3 \% (95 \% CI, 17.1 \%-38.1 \%) for carcass specimens. The prevalence was significantly higher in non-PCR techniques (29.5 \%, [95 \% CI, 22.4 \%-37.8 \%]) than in PCR techniques (15.3 \%, [95 \% CI, 12.1 \%-19.1 \%]). The cumulative evidence showed that the prevalence of chlamydial infections in birds has been relatively stable around 20 \% since 2012. This study indicates that the global prevalence of chlamydial infections in birds is quite high and all bird orders are potential sources for human psittacosis.},

	abstract = {Bacterial infection is a common wound complication that can significantly delay healing. Classical local therapies for infected wounds are expensive and are frequently ineffective. One alternative therapy is photodynamic therapy (PDT). We conducted a systematic review to clarify whether PDT is useful for bacteria-infected wounds in animal models. PubMed and Medline were searched for articles on PDT in infected skin wounds in animals. The language was limited to English. Nineteen articles met the inclusion criteria. The overall study methodological quality was moderate, with a low-moderate risk of bias. The animal models were mice and rats. The wounds were excisional, burn, and abrasion wounds. Wound size ranged from 6 mm in diameter to 1.5 × 1.5 cm(2) . Most studies inoculated the wounds with Pseudomonas aeruginosa or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Eleven and 17 studies showed that the PDT of infected wounds significantly decreased wound size and bacterial counts, respectively. Six, four, and two studies examined the effect of PDT on infected wound-cytokine levels, wound-healing time, and body weight, respectively. Most indicated that PDT had beneficial effects on these variables. PDT accelerated bacteria-infected wound healing in animals by promoting wound closure and killing bacteria.},

	abstract = {(1) Background: Viral diseases are important as they can cause significant clinical disease in both wild and domestic animals, as well as in humans. They also make up a large proportion of emerging infectious diseases. (2) Methods: A scoping review of peer-reviewed publications was performed and based on the guidelines set out in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for scoping reviews. (3) Results: The final set of publications consisted of 145 publications. Thirty-two viruses were identified in the publications and 50 African ungulates were reported/diagnosed with viral infections. Eighteen countries had viruses diagnosed in wild ungulates reported in the literature. (4) Conclusions: A comprehensive review identified several areas where little information was available and recommendations were made. It is recommended that governments and research institutions offer more funding to investigate and report viral diseases of greater clinical and zoonotic significance. A further recommendation is for appropriate One Health approaches to be adopted for investigating, controlling, managing and preventing diseases. Diseases which may threaten the conservation of certain wildlife species also require focused attention. In order to keep track of these diseases, it may be necessary to consider adding a "Wildlife disease and infection" category to the World Organisation for Animal Health-listed diseases.},

	abstract = {Background: Accumulative evidences on the beneficial effects of palm oil are progressively reported; however, there are still several controversies related to their effects on the risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This review explores the effects of palm oil and its liquid fraction namely palm olein, which is commonly used as cooking oil on four lipid parameters; total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), which play an important role as CVD-related biomarkers. A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify the relevant studies on palm oil and the lipid parameters specifically focusing on the in-vivo animal model. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in Medline via EBSCOhost, Medline via OVID and Scopus. Studies were limited to the English language published between the years of 2000 and 2019. The main inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) Study with in-vivo animal experiments [the animal should be limited to mammals] (2) Study should have evaluated the effects of palm oil or palm olein on plasma or serum lipid parameter (3) Study should have used palm oil or palm olein in the form of pure or refined oil (4) The treatment of palm oil or palm olein was assessed using the following outcomes: plasma or serum TC, TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C concentration (5) Study should have control group and (6) studies on specific fatty acid, fraction enriched tocotrienol and tocopherol, crude palm oil, kernel oil, red palm oil, thermally oxidized palm oil, hydrogenated palm oil, and palm oil or palm olein based products namely margarine, palm milk, butter and cream were excluded. The quality and the risk of bias on the selected studies were assessed using the ARRIVE Guideline and SYRCLE's Risk of Bias tools, respectively. Results: The literature search successfully identified 17 potentially relevant articles, whereby nine of them met the inclusion criteria. All research articles included in this review were in vivo studies comprising seven rats, one hamster and one mice model. Conclusion: Significant positive outcomes were observed in several lipid parameters such as TC and LDL-C. The evidence from this review supported that palm oil and palm olein possess high potential as lipid-lowering agents.},

	abstract = {We have a poor understanding of differences in learning performance between male and female non-avian reptiles compared to other vertebrates. Learning studies in non-avian reptiles have greatly increased in the last 10 years providing an opportunity to test for sex-based learning using a meta-analysis. Although, we initially considered all reptiles, only lizard studies (N = 11) provided sufficient data to calculate effect sizes. We found weak evidence for sex-dependent learning and moderate heterogeneity in effect sizes across studies. Although, our hypothesized moderator variables (stimulus or task type, species, genus and family) explained little variation. Indeed, our results show that only one species (Egernia striolata) exhibited a sex-dependent learning difference, with males learning faster than females. Together, our meta-analysis indicated a general lack of effective reporting on attributes of study methodology (i.e., animal sex, sample sizes). We propose that future research improve reporting by openly sharing their data for the use in similar analyses. The limited sample currently constrains our ability to effectively disentangle whether sex differences vary across different tasks and stimuli. We urge authors to incorporate both sexes in experimental designs and test them on ecologically relevant cognitive assays to improve our understanding of the degree of sex differences in non-avian reptile learning.},
